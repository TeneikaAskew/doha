HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has approximately $14,094 in delinquent debt and a $60,452 student loan account\nthat was in deferment.  Approximately $10,651 of the delinquent debt are medical accounts related\nto past and current health issues. Several factors beyond Applicant's control have caused and\ncontinue to cause financial problems for her. She fully disclosed her financial situation when she\ncompleted her trustworthiness application. She does not live above her means. Under her current\ncircumstances, she has acted responsibly. Trustworthiness concerns are mitigated. Applicant's\neligibility for an assignment to a sensitive position is granted.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; and  Memorandum\n1\nfrom the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Counterintelligence and Security, titled \"Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases,\" dated November 19, 2004.\n Tr. at 5; Gov 1.\n2\n Tr. at 10. \n3\n Tr. at 11.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn September 23, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\"); and the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\napproved December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006.  On February 20, 2007, DOHA\n1\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which\nis in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations.\nIn a sworn statement dated March 12, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have her case heard before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another\nadministrative judge on June 20, 2007. The case was transferred to me on August 2, 2007. A Notice\nof Hearing was issued on August 23, 2007, scheduling the hearing for September 18, 2007.  The\nhearing was held as scheduled. The government offered four exhibits which were admitted as\nGovernment (Gov) Exhibits 1-4 without objection.  Applicant offered one 17 page exhibit which was\nadmitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A without objection.  The record was held open until October\n2, 2007, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely\nsubmitted a 50 page document which was marked and admitted as AE B without objection. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on September 28, 2007.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and  1.j but denies all\nthe remaining SOR allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after\na thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who\nis seeking a position of public trust.  She is divorced and has two children, a daughter, age 12, and\n2\na son, age 11.  She is an operations and processing specialist with a healthcare company that works\n3\non a government contract.  She has worked for the company for approximately five years.  She\nworked as a term employee for 18 months and was made permanent in October 2004.     \n4\n\n Gov 1. \n5\n Answer to SOR, dated March 12, 2007.\n6\n Tr. at 23, 27-32.\n7\n Tr. at 23. \n8\n Tr. at 28, 32.\n9\n Tr. at 29-31. \n10\n Tr. at 30. \n11\n Tr. at 34; AE B at 23.\n12\n Tr. at 10. \n13\n3\nOn September 23, 2005, Applicant completed a public trust position application (SF 85-P).\nShe attached a Trans Union credit report , dated June 2, 2005 to the application.5\nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following delinquent\naccounts: a $227 delinquent phone bill account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a, Tr. at 21-22; Gov\n1, Trans Union at 2; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 2); a $61 account owed to a phone company placed for\ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.b, Tr. at 22); a $160 medical account, placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. at\n23; Gov 1, Trans Union at 4; Gov 4 at 2); $115 dental account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr.\nat 27-28; Gov 1, Trans Union at 4; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 2); a $914 account placed for collection in\nMay 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. at 28; Gov 6 at 5); a $885 phone bill charged off in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f;\nTr. at 29; Gov 1, Trans Union at 5; Gov 2 at 3; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3); a $1,356 account placed for\ncollection in February 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Tr. at 32; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3); a $60,452 student loan\naccount more than 120 days past due (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Tr. at 35; Gov 3 at 3); and a $10,376 medical\naccount, placed for collection in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Tr. at 37; Gov 1; Trans Union at 4; Gov 2\nat 9).\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admits that she is unable pay her delinquent debts. 6\nShe claims that she is unaware of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e and 1.g.   She currently\n7\nhas an account with the debtor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and owes them $400.   She thinks the accounts\n8\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g might be her ex-husband's credit cards.  She terminated a cell phone\n9\ncontract with the cell phone company that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The cell phone company charged\nan excessive termination fee. She contested this charge a few years ago.  \n10\nApplicant's financial problems began when she separated from her husband in December\n2001.  She filed for divorce and the divorce became final in December 2002.   Initially, Applicant\n11\nhad custody of their daughter and her ex-husband had custody of their son. Applicant gained full\ncustody of both children in April 2006 after charges were filed against her ex-husband for sodomy\nand sex abuse of his stepchild in 2005.  Her ex-husband's court proceedings continue. Applicant\n12\nreceives very little child support ($58 a week) because her ex-husband's income was reduced as a\nresult of the pending charges.   \n13\n\n Tr. at 11; AE A at 6, 11-13,  \n14\n AE B at 37. \n15\n Tr. at 20-21; 52.\n16\n Tr. at 21; AE  A at 7. \n17\n Tr. at 19. \n18\n Tr. at 20. \n19\n Tr. at 19; AE A at  14-15. \n20\n Tr. at 19-20, 26-27; AE A at 17. \n21\n Tr. at 20; AE A at 3-4. \n22\n Tr. at 33-34. \n23\n4\nIn February 2007, her 12-year-old daughter was raped. She has incurred additional medical\nexpenses and prescription medications related to her daughter's treatment.  In July 2007, Applicant\n14\nmoved out of the apartment complex where the rape occurred out of concern for her daughter.  Her\ndaughter suffers from post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the rape.   She moved in with a\n15\ncousin and her rent has been reduced from $714 a month to approximately $300 a month plus\nutilities.   She made arrangements with the apartment complex to pay what she owes them.  She\n16\nowed a total of $1,088.  Her $500 security deposit was applied towards this debt. In August 2007,\nshe entered into a repayment agreement, and is currently paying $100 a month until the debt is paid\nin full.   \n17\nApplicant has several health issues that contributed to her financial situation. Most of her\ndelinquent accounts are medical bills. She did not have health insurance when she was a term\nemployee. In 2005, while she was uninsured, she was treated in the emergency room and hospitalized\nand required three blood transfusions.  She incurred approximately $10,000 in medical bills as a\n18\nresult (SOR \u00b6 1.i).   In June 2007, she had back surgery and was placed on the disabled list by her\n19\ndoctor. She was also placed on Family Medical Leave. Even though her doctor advised her not to\nreturn to work until August 6, 2007, she returned to work earlier in order to earn money to pay her\nbills.20\nOne of the hospitals garnished Applicant's paycheck. They recently stopped garnishing her\npaycheck.  She does not know why but thinks it might be related to a request for financial assistance\nthat she submitted.  The total amount of the garnishment was $10,000 and relates to Applicant's 2005\nhospital treatment while uninsured.  The hospital's charity fund took care of two of the medical bills\n21\nin the amount of $837 and $500.22\nApplicant has not attempted to contact the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f. and 1.g. Her\nfocus right now is to focus on the needs of her children. She realizes that she has bills to pay but her\nchildren are more important to her.  She claims that her student loan account is in deferment and\n23\nis working with the student loan company to extend the deferment. She claims that her student loans\n\n Tr. at 35-36.\n24\n Tr. at 5.\n25\n Tr. at 36. \n26\n AE B at 35. \n27\n Tr. at 37-38, 41. \n28\n Tr. at 38-39. \n29\n Tr. at 45; AE B at 37. \n30\n Tr. at 40; 47-48; AE A at 6; AE B at 13-17. \n31\n Tr. at 45. \n32\n Tr. at 40, \n33\n Tr. at 40. \n34\n Tr. at 43. \n35\n Tr. at 54-55. \n36\n5\nhave never been delinquent.  She has been taking college courses off and on since 1998. She\n24\nintended to take classes off campus recently but that was put on hold after her daughter's rape. She\nneeds 20 more credits to earn her degree.  She claims that she currently does not have time to\n25\ncomplete her college courses.26\nApplicant pays her cousin $300 a month for rent and is responsible for half the utility bill,\nand anything above the amount he normally pays. She pays car insurance of $834 annually,\napproximately $69.50 per month.  She does not have a car payment. She purchased a 1987 car from\n27\na relative about two years ago for $750, and it is paid off.  She gets financial assistance for before\n28\nand after school care for her son which costs $67 a week.  She pays $88 a month for a storage unit.\n29\n30\nShe pays for her daughter's prescription medications. Her insurance does not cover anything\nuntil after she pays a $4,000 deductible.  The state Crime Victim's Compensation Board will\nreimburse Applicant for some, but not all, of her daughter's medical costs which were incurred as\na result of the rape.  She makes too much income to qualify for additional assistance.  Applicant\n31\n32\nis current on her state and federal income taxes.  She receives a tax refund and applies the refunds\ntowards her debts.  She has no credit cards but has one debit card.  She has not opened any new\n33\n34\naccounts.35\nApplicant's co-worker testified that Applicant is the only permanent employee in the\ndepartment. She is currently training as a back-up to Applicant, and is amazed at the amount of\nknowledge and work that she does. She states that Applicant is truly an asset to her position and truly\nknows how to get the work done.  Applicant's work performance is also reflected by favorable\n36\n\n AE B at 2-6.\n37\n AE B at 40-42; 43-50. \n38\n Department of the Navy v.

The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines sets forth personnel security\nguidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.\nThe adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.40\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guidelines, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n41\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n42\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\n\n Id.\n43\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n44\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n45\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n46\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n47\n7\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n43\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n44\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n45\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n46\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n47\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a)\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b619(c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply to Applicant's case. Applicant has struggled financially since 2001. She currently has\napproximately $14,094 in delinquent debt.  She will soon be required to resume payments on her\nstudent loan accounts which have a total approximate balance of $60,452.  Applicant has been unable\nto resolve much of this debt due to her limited income.\nThe concern under Financial Considerations can be mitigated. Applicant  has a history of\nfinancial irresponsibility spanning several years. She still has significant financial problems.\nTherefore, I cannot apply Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20 (a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment).\nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies. Applicant's financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond her control. Her\n\n8\nfinancial problems began after her divorce in 2001. She supports two children while receiving\nminimal child support from her ex-husband who is pending serious criminal charges. The probability\nof additional child support is, at best, uncertain. She has several medical issues that caused her to\nincur a lot of medical expenses when she had no health insurance.  She continues to incur medical\ncosts having recently undergone back surgery in June 2007.  She was on Family Medical Leave for\na several weeks after the back surgery which reduced her income. The unfortunate rape of her 12-\nyear-old daughter in February 2007 triggered additional medical costs and related expenses. The\nshock of this event continues to cause Applicant great distress.\nApplicant meets the first element of FC MC \u00b6 20(b) - (the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person's control).  A question remains as to whether she\nmet the second element of FC MC \u00b6 20(b) - (and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances). Given the circumstances that Appellant has endured over the past several years, she\nhas acted as responsibly as is within her means.  Applicant is still dealing with circumstances that are\nbeyond her control. She and her daughter's health cause medical expenses. The status of her ex-\nhusband is uncertain. She is still coping with the aftermath of her daughter's rape.  While she states\nthat she has not taken steps to resolve the delinquent accounts, given her situation this is reasonable.\nShe did not hide her financial situation when she filled out her trustworthiness application.  She even\nattached a copy of her credit report to her application. She has made attempts to resolve her\ndelinquent medical accounts by applying for financial assistance with the hospital. Of the delinquent\ndebts, which total $14,094, approximately $10,651 are for medical accounts.  Applicant has only\n$3,443 of delinquent consumer debt.  She does have a  significant student loan balance but she is\nworking with the student loan company to make sure the account does not default. She does not live\nabove her means. She recently moved in with a relative in order to reduce her living expenses. Her\ntrustworthiness and reliability is demonstrated by her five years of favorable work performance with\nher current employer.  Considering her current situation, she is acting responsibly. For these reasons,\nI conclude FC MC \u00b6 20 (b) applies.\nBased on the facts of this case, I find that circumstances beyond Applicant's control have\nadversely affected her financial situation. She has mitigated the financial considerations\ntrustworthiness concern. Guideline F is decided for Applicant.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. While Applicant has financial problems, many factors beyond her control contributed\nto the situation. She fully disclosed her financial problems when she submitted her trustworthiness\napplication. She has a five year track record of  favorable performance with her current employer. She\nis highly regarded by her clients and coworkers. She has acted responsibly under the circumstances\nthat she has endured over the past several years. Applicant should be advised that it is in her best\n\n9\ninterests to seek out financial counseling in order to deal with her financial situation after things settle\ndown in order to avoid this issue should she apply for a renewal of a trustworthiness position in the\nfuture. Based on the evidence in the record and the particular facts of this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility\nis granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Edmunds, Esquire\nSYNOPSIS\n\nDual nationality is not alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\n1\n2\nThe Applicant has surrendered her Latvian passport.   She is married to a native born\n1\nAmerican.  Her elderly, retired parents live in Russia.  She no longer owns any property in Latvia.\nAs the Applicant has \u201clongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\u201d it is unlikely that she\n\u201cwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of . . . [her foreign relatives]\n. . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  A determination of trustworthiness and access to personal sensitive\ninformation is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I) entered into a memorandum of\nagreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January of 1987.\nOn April 4, 2007, DOHA, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ndetermination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive\nSystems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on April 25, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned for resolution on June 15, 2007.  A notice of\nhearing was issued that same day, and the case was heard on July 10, 2007.  The Government\nsubmitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on July 18, 2007.  The issues raised here\nare whether the Applicant\u2019s perceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence militate against a\ndetermination of trustworthiness and access to personal sensitive information.  [The Applicant denies\nall of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 45 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks an ADP-I/II/III position on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n\n3\nThe Applicant was born in Russia in 1962, to a Latvian/Russian father and a Russian mother\n(TR at page 24 line 24 to page 25 line 12, and at page 36 line 20 to page 37 line 5).  She emigrated\nfrom Latvia to the U.S. in 1999 (TR at page 34 lines 11~13).  She is married to a native born\nAmerican, who also holds a security clearance, and who is working as a contractor for DoD in\nKuwait (TR at page 24 line 24 to page 25 line 12, and Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 5).  The\nApplicant was naturalized in 2005 (TR at page 35 line 1 to page 36 line 8).\n\n4\n1.a.  The Applicant has surrendered her Latvian passport; and although it is not alleged, she\nhas also renounced her Latvian citizenship (TR at page 25 lines 13~15, at page 34 lines 3~4, at page\n46 lines 14~17, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s elderly, retired parents live in Russia (TR at page 26 lines 5~17, and\nGX 1 at page 6).  Her 71 year old mother, and 74 year old father both worked in the construction\nsector (TR at page 46 line 18 to page 47 line 19).  Her father still does some consulting to a private\nconstruction company (Id).\n2.b. and 2.c.  The Applicant traveled to Latvia in 2000 and in 2005, and to Russia in 2003\n(TR at page 27 line 24 to page 28 line 7, and at 29 lines 5~23).  She used her Latvian passport, as\nshe was not yet a U.S. citizen (Id).  Since becoming a U.S. citizen, she has only used her American\npassport (TR at page 27 line 24 to page 28 line 7, and at 29 lines 5~23).\n2.d.  The Applicant no longer owns any property in Latvia, as ownership has passed to her\nadult daughter (TR at page 29 line 24 to page 30 line 8, and at page 40 line 17 to page 43 line 24).\nThe Applicant would report any attempt at coercion vis-a-vis her Russian relatives \u201cto [the]\npolice and . . . [her] employer\u201d (TR at page 26 line 18 to page 27 line 6).\nAs the Applicant has connections with both Latvia and Russia, I must also consider both\ncountries.  Latvia has a parliamentary democracy system of Government that has been independent\nof the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) since 1991.  The Latvian government\ngenerally respects the human right of its citizens and resident non-citizens, but there are problems\nin some areas.  The Judiciary has significant problems of inefficiency and corruption, and the\nconditions of its prison system remains poor with overcrowding.\nRussia has an active, recent, and ongoing intelligence collection program targeting the U.S.\nBeyond collection and espionage directed at the U.S., Russia has provided technology for weapons\nof mass destruction to China, Venezuela, India and Iran.  Russia also has internal problems including\nterrorism and a problematic human rights record.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n\n5\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and her suitability for a trustworthiness determination, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant is presently qualifies for a sensitive Systems Position.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently, was a dual national with Latvia, and maintained a Latvian\npassport.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there\nwas an \"exercise of any right . . . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . . .  This\nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; . . .\"  This is countered,\nhowever, by the second and fifth mitigating conditions. \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d and \u201cthe passport has been . . . surrendered . . .\u201d  Here,\nthe Applicant has not only initiated the renunciation of her Latvian citizenship, but has also\nsurrendered her Latvian passport.\nThe Applicant's parents are citizens of and reside in Russia.  The first and second\ndisqualifying conditions under Foreign Influence are arguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and\ncreates \u201ca potential conflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that\ninformation.\u201d  Under the facts of this particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first\nand second mitigating conditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with her parents is\n\u201csuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of . . . [her parents] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\n\n6\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Her family, friends and\ncolleagues aver that she is trustworthy (AppXs B~K).  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation under the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines B and C are found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her\nalleged Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\nconditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met\nher ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nd.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability and eligibility\nfor the Applicant to hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nRichard A.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRonald C. Sykstus, Esq.,\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption and\ncriminal conduct due to the recency of the 2005 and 2006 incidents involving alcohol. Applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nGX 1(Application of Security Clearance (SF 86), dated August 30, 2005).\n1\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n2\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nCounsel for Applicant was not available in October for a hearing. Thus, the earliest date for both parties was\n3\nNovember 1, 2007.\nApplicant, through his counsel, waived the 15 day notice requirement.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated August 13, 2007.\n5\nGX 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated August 30, 2005).\n6\nId.\n7\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2005, Applicant completed his security clearance (SF 86) application.   On\n1\nJuly 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n2\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of  Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nOn August 13, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On September 4, 2007, the case was assigned to me.3\nA Notice of Hearing was issued on October 4, 2007.  At the scheduled hearing on November 1,\n4\n2007, the Government introduced  Government Exhibits (GX) 1-2 into evidence without objections.\nApplicant testified and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A-Q into evidence without objections\nfrom Department Counsel. He also had two witnesses testify in his behalf as indicated in the\ntranscript. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted allegations in subparagraphs 1.b -g,  in his SOR response under Guideline\nG.  He denied allegations in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.h and subparagraph 2.a. After a complete\n5\nreview of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of\nfact:\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After receiving his\nundergraduate degree in 1978 with a bachelors in mechanical engineering, he was employed in the\nfield of government contracting specializing in research development.

He pled guilty and\nwas sentenced to ten days in jail suspended and fined $100. He was hang gliding on that day with\na friend. He was 25 years old at the time. On the way back from the activity, he and his friend\nconsumed a bottle of whiskey. He had not eaten and the alcohol had a powerful effect. When he\narrived at his friend\u2019s apartment, he was not invited in. So he decided to drive home. He quickly\nrealized he was not able to drive and pulled over to the side of the road. The police found him in his\ncar and he was arrested for DUI.8\nIn December 1982, a year later, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication.\nHe had been drinking with friends at a game and drove after that. He veered to avoid a car coming\ntoward him on the road and hit a curb. The police smelled alcohol and Applicant admitted he had\nbeen drinking. He was then charged with public intoxication.9\nIn 1998, Applicant was drinking beer on the job. His co-worker reported that Applicant had\nthree to four beers. A representative of the company took Applicant for an alcohol test. He tested\npositive and was suspended from work for one month. At that time he attended counseling. He\ncompleted six sessions with a psychologist over a four-month period.  \n10\nIn March 2004, Applicant was a manager on a research program working with subcontracts\nat their facilities. He returned one day from lunch after consuming three beers. His office partner\nreported Applicant to Human Resources after he smelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath. Applicant\nthen had to report for an alcohol test which rendered a positive result. He was sent home that day and\nreceived a termination letter approximately one month later for misconduct despite his exceptional\nwork record.11\nOn June 23, 2005, Applicant was at home where he had been drinking a few beers. A friend\ncalled him and he decided to go out to meet her. He had an automobile accident when he swerved\nto avoid hitting a vehicle. The police who investigated the accident gave Applicant a Breathalyzer\nand the result initiated the charge of DUI. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail;\nsuspended, one-year probation, suspended driver\u2019s license for 90 days and ordered to attended\nHighway Intoxication School. He was also fined $600.12\nOn November 18, 2005, Applicant was arrested for a probation violation. He admits he was\nnervous about an incident that occurred the day before and could not sleep, so he had a few drinks\nto help him sleep. He arrived at the courthouse early the next morning to pay $20 for the class he had\n\nTr. 46.\n13\nTr. 47.\n14\nGX 2 (Treatment Center Records and Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories, dated 2006).\n15\nTr. 67.\n16\nTr. 55-57.\n17\nAX R (Affidavit, dated October 22, 2007).\n18\nAX S (Affidavit, dated October 22, 2007).\n19\nAX I (1995 Leadership Award); AX J (Letter of commendation 2005).\n20\nAX A-G (U.S. Patent documents from 1982-2001).\n21\n4\nmissed. He decided to schedule his probation visit then and when the probation officer arrived he\ncould smell alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath. 13\nOn March 1, 2006, Applicant was home drinking some beer with his brother. He received\na phone call from his probation officer why he had missed his visit the day before. Applicant thought\nhe did not have scheduled visits. His probation officer ordered him down to the office that day.\nWhen Applicant arrived, the officer smelled alcohol on his breath and arrested him for a probation\nviolation. He pled guilty and was sentenced to ten days in jail.  \n14\nFrom April 4, 2006 until July 26, 2006, Applicant received outpatient counseling for alcohol\ndependence. He quit drinking for approximately one year.  However, at the hearing, Applicant\n15\nacknowledged that he enjoys a social drink. He believes he is in control of his drinking. He believes\nhe had bad luck before, but now he will not drink and drive. He states he does not drink to excess.\nHe also stated he only drinks beer. \nHowever, one witness confirmed that he occasionally drinks a mixed drink.  Applicant did\n16\nnot acknowledge that he had received a diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence from the 2006 outpatient\ncounseling by the staff psychologist. However, the documents in the record clearly state the\ndiagnosis. Applicant, despite the recommendation from the counseling not to be around people who\ndrink, volunteered that all of his friends are social drinkers. He also does not follow the\nrecommendation to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) after the counseling. When Applicant\ncompleted the interrogatory in June 2007, he answered \u201cno\u201d to a question about current drinking.\nUpon questioning, he claimed he started drinking shortly after completing the interrogatory.17\nApplicant\u2019s friends attest to his responsibility as a social drinker, using good judgment where\nalcohol is involved. He is described as a good neighbor who is generous with his time.  Moreover,\n18\nhe expressed to friends how scared he became in the realization that he could have harmed innocent\npeople while driving drunk. He is contrite, embarrassed and humiliated.   \n19\nApplicant has spent his entire career as an engineering scientist.  He has received seven\n20\npatents for his inventions over the years.

He\n22\nworked on the space shuttle at one point in his career. He was employed with one contractor for 19\nyears.  He was working on a specific program but in 2001 the program was cancelled. \nApplicant is currently an employee(Design/Engineering Manager). He loves the work and\nis very excited about this position. His current supervisor recommends Applicant for a security\nclearance.  He has exhibited clear judgment, reliability and trustworthiness in his work related\n23\nactivities. He was hired for his accomplishments in the field and his successful employment history.24\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n25\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n26\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n27\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\n\n Id.\n28\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n29\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n30\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n30\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n31\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.32\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndeterminations as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant was arrested in\n1981, 1982, and 2005 for alcohol-related incidents. His last alcohol incident was in 2006 for a\nprobation violation, having consumed alcohol before meeting with his probation officer. Consequently,\nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser\nor alcohol dependent applies.\n\n7\nApplicant had two incidents while working involving alcohol. He drank alcohol during lunch\nand later returned to work and was suspended in 1998 and ordered to attend counseling. Again, in\n2004, he consumed alcohol and was terminated for misconduct (violation of prohibition against\ndrinking alcohol at work). AC DC AG \u00b6 22(b) alcohol related incidents at work, such as reporting for\nwork or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol depend applies in this case.\nApplicant admitted consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1998 until at least May 2007. AC DC AG \u00b6 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent applies.\nApplicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in the outpatient treatment program in 2006 by\na licensed staff psychologist. Thus AC DC AG \u00b6 20(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence and 20(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program applies.\nApplicant had two parole violations for alcohol use in 2005 and 2006. Thus, 20(g) failure to\nfollow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence applies.\nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the\nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) AG \u00b6 23(a) so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s 1981, 1982 and 1998 drinking are remote in time. Applicant asserted that his\ndrinking no longer plays a necessary role in his life but an enjoyable part of his life. He does\nacknowledge that he drinks on a special occasion but does not drink and drive. His driving incident\ninvolving alcohol was in 2004 and 2005. He has since had a 2006 probation violation. Applicant\u2019s\ndrinking has been a pattern over more than 20 years. Thus, 23(a) does not apply in this case.\nApplicant acknowledged his mistakes with alcohol but also speaks about bad luck. His\ndescriptions of each incident involving alcohol are somewhat phrased as rationalizations. He has\nconsciously decided, against the recommendation of a treatment program, to continue to drink in\nmoderation, and not abstain from alcohol or remain in an aftercare program. He is inconsistent in that\nhis verbal statements do not match any evidence of steps to overcome his problem. He stated that he\nwas not aware that he had an alcohol dependence diagnosis, although it was in his signed treatment\nplan.  AC DC 23(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse,\nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if alcohol abuser) does not apply in this case.\nApplicant successfully completed his 2006 outpatient treatment program but declines to follow\nthe recommendation of abstinence. He did refrain from drinking for a period of almost one year, but\nhas decided to modify his consumption. Thus 26(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient\nor outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\n\n8\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendation, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization\nand has received a favorable diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical\nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized treatment program) does not apply.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegations or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) both apply.\nApplicant admitted the alcohol-related driving offenses and the parole violations. \nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does\nnot apply in this case. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related driving incident was in 2005. He had more\ndifficulty in 2006 with alcohol causing a parole violation.\nCC MC AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life) does not apply. Although Applicant states he is\nnow in a great job and has good friends he states alcohol is an enjoyable part of his life.\nCC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) partially applies.\nApplicant completed alcohol treatment. He has been very successful in his work and garnered\npromotions and praise. He acknowledges mistakes and bad luck. However, the last criminal incident\nis in 2006. This is too recent to be mitigated.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant has an outstanding achievement record for more than 30 years. He\nis praised for his numerous accomplishments in the field of mechanical engineering, including seven\n\n9\npatents. He is highly respected in his field. Several friends and colleagues attest to his reliability and\nprofessionalism.\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption for more than 20 years has caused problems for him at work\nand in his personal life. Granted, several of his alcohol-related incidents were many years ago;\nhowever, in 2005 and 2006, Applicant again had arrests involving alcohol. Despite his outpatient\ncounseling in 2006, he continues to drink. On separate occasions in 2006 and 2007 during his\ninvestigation, he stated he intended not to drink in the future. However, he has decided that he can\nresponsibly modify his drinking and that his earlier mistakes will not be repeated.  He has made a\ndecision to not abstain from alcohol as the treatment recommended. He is adamant that the alcohol is\nnot a necessary part of his life, but it is an enjoyable one. There are some inconsistencies in\ndescriptions of what he drinks and the role of alcohol in his life. This may be true, but it is premature\nto conclude that Applicant has overcome doubts as to his ability to exercise the requisite judgment and\ndiscretion expected of one who holds a security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nDue to a criminal conviction for which he served 20 months of confinement, the Defense\nDepartment is prohibited from granting Applicant a security clearance unless a waiver is granted.\nEligibility for a security clearance is denied solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1).\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nA.\nIntroduction\nIn October 1998, Applicant pleaded guilty to cruelty to children to receive deferred\nadjudication under the Georgia First Offender Act. He was confined for 20 months and then served\nprobation until May 2007, when he was discharged without an adjudication of guilt. Under 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 986, a person who has been convicted of a crime and served more than one year of confinement\nis disqualified from being granted a security clearance. Because federal courts have decided that a\ndeferred adjudication under Georgia\u2019s first-offender law is a conviction for sentencing and\nimmigration purposes, it follows that Applicant has a conviction for security-clearance purposes. \nB.\nProcedural background\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a security\nclearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of\n1\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 9,\n2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for\nthe action and alleges security concerns under Guideline D for sexual behavior and Guideline J for\ncriminal conduct. In addition, the SOR includes an allegation that Applicant is disqualified, as a\nmatter of law, from having a security clearance granted or renewed by the Defense Department under\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending formal amendment.\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated February 9, 2007, which is after\nthe effective date.  \n\n3\nOn March 16, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. He amended his\nreply to the SOR on May 24, 2007. The case was assigned for hearing to another administrative\njudge on May 9, 2007. It was reassigned on June 9, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nJune 19, 2007. \nAt hearing, the SOR was amended, without objections, by removing subparagraph 1.c from\nGuideline D and placing it under Guideline J as subparagraph 2.b (R. 17\u201318). This action was taken\nso that the 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 allegation was properly alleged under Guideline J. Also without\nobjections, the SOR was amended by changing subparagraph 1.a to reflect that Applicant pleaded\nguilty to one count, not two, of cruelty to children (R. 25\u201326). This action was taken to conform to\nthe evidence.   \nDOHA received the hearing transcript on June 27, 2007. The record was left open until July\n13, 2007, to allow the parties to brief the central issue in this case: Does Applicant\u2019s  guilty plea and\nsentence to confinement and probation under Georgia\u2019s first-offender law constitute a conviction for\npurposes of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986? Both parties submitted briefs (Appellate Exhibits II and III).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old engineer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. He\nhas worked for his current employer since January 2001 (Exhibit B). He initially worked as a\nmanufacturing engineer on microwave switching equipment for space applications. Based on his\nwork ethic and adaptability, he was reassigned to the company\u2019s mechanical production group. The\ncompany recently reassigned Applicant to the mechanical engineering group to take advantage of\nhis multiple skills. For this role, Applicant may need access to classified information to work on the\ncompany\u2019s secured programs. He has been a key performer for the company and has established a\nstrong work record.\nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in November 2005 (Exhibit 1). This\nis his initial application to obtain a security clearance from the Defense Department. In response to\na question about his police record, he fully disclosed his 1995 arrest and 1998 guilty plea to one\ncount of cruelty to children based on sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl. \nIn about 1994, Applicant\u2019s family met the girl\u2019s family through church. The girl was the\nyoungest of several children in that family. For a brief period, Applicant dated the 25-year-old sister\nof the girl. During September\u2013November 1995, the then 27-year-old Applicant engaged in sexual\nactivity with the 13-year-old girl. The sexual activity consisted of oral sex received by Applicant and\nmutual touching. The sexual activity took place in a car when Applicant was giving the girl a ride\nhome from an event or activity. It took place about five to seven times. Applicant did not orchestrate\nthings so he could be alone with the girl, but he did not prevent it from happening. Some weeks\nbefore his arrest, Applicant told the girl they could no longer be alone and he would not give her\nrides home if they were alone in the car. \n\n O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-8-60 \u2013 65.\n3\n O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-1-12(8). \n4\n See \n5\nwww.ganet.org/gbi.\n4\nApplicant was unable to find a job working as an engineer after completing his degree in\nDecember 1994. About one year later, he decided to follow his father\u2019s footsteps and applied to\nbecome a firefighter. In December 1995, he disclosed his sexual activity with the girl during a\nroutine pre-employment polygraph examination. Two weeks later he was arrested and charged with\nfelony child molestation and felony aggravated child molestation. \nIn October 1998, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of cruelty to children (Exhibit C). It\nwas a negotiated plea under the Georgia First Offender Act.  It resulted in the court not imposing a\n3\njudgment of guilt and deferring proceedings. The court sentenced Applicant to confinement for two\nyears followed by probation for eight years. Applicant was confined in a minimum-security facility\nfrom February 1999 until his release in early October 2000, a period of about 20 months. \nAs a probation requirement, Applicant entered a treatment program. In October 2000, he had\na psychosexual evaluation to assess his then psychosexual functioning and need for sex-offender\ntreatment (Exhibit A). During the initial evaluation, Applicant admitted molesting the 13-year-old\ngirl, but he minimized his conduct and blamed the victim. The evaluation recommended that\nApplicant enroll in a structured, cognitive-behavioral sex-offender treatment program involving\ngroup and individual treatment. Applicant attended the program since November 2000.\n  \nThe active phase of treatment consisted of 7 phases of treatment covered in a minimum of\n75 weeks. The aftercare phase of treatment consisted of group therapy for one year and then reduced\nin the maintenance phase. The maintenance phase of treatment consisted of therapeutic services in\nsupport of a relapse prevention plan for one year. As of July 2006, he was in full compliance with\nthe treatment recommendations and conditions of probation, deemed to be a low risk to reoffend,\nand did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a pedophile (a person sexually attracted to children).\nSince July 2006, Applicant completed the counseling and treatment requirements required by\nprobation and was released by his counselor with permission from his probation officer (Exhibit F).\nOn May 15, 2007, the court terminated Applicant\u2019s probation (Exhibit F). This action was\ntaken more than one year ahead of the scheduled termination in October 2008. Two weeks later, the\ncourt discharged Applicant under the state\u2019s first-offender law without a court adjudication of guilt\n(Exhibit G). \nAt one time, Applicant was required to register with the state\u2019s sexual-offender registry. He\nis no longer required to register due to his discharge under the state\u2019s first-offender law.  With the\n4\nparties\u2019 consent, a search was conducted of Georgia\u2019s online sexual-offender registry (R. 73\u201375).\nThe search was conducted using Applicant\u2019s name and address and the result was \u201cno offender\nfound.\u201d5\nApplicant attributed his criminal conduct to sexual naivete and low self-esteem. He was\nraised in a strict, religious home. It was a sheltered environment that he believes did not prepare him\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n6\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n7\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n8\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n9\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

This breakup devastated Applicant emotionally and left him with low self-esteem.\nHe accepts responsibility for his conduct, and he understands that as an adult he had a duty to prevent\nany sexual activity with a minor child. Through the sex-offender treatment program, Applicant\nlearned about the offense cycle as well as techniques to prevent a relapse. Also, Applicant is careful\nnot to put himself in a compromising position. For example, although he and his family attend\nchurch, he does not teach Sunday school or participate in youth programs.    \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf (R. 99\u2013112). She is 40 years old and has degrees in\nchild development and education. She taught school in the past, and she has been a stay-at-home\nmother since the birth of their son about four years ago. She met Applicant in 1997, and they married\nin March 2001. She learned about his pending criminal charges early in their dating. She describes\nApplicant as an incredible father and husband. Applicant has been reliable, trustworthy, honest, and\nused good judgment during their marriage. She has never had any concerns that Applicant was\nsexually interested in young girls. They base their marriage on God\u2019s principles, they keep their\nfamily in church, and Applicant is head of the household. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n6\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n7\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n8\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n9\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n10\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n11\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n14\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n15\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n16\n See Attorney Sheldon  I. Cohen\u2019s publication Loss of a Security Clearance Because of a Felony Conviction:\n17\nThe Effect of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the \u201cSmith Amendment,\u201d at www.sheldoncohen.com/publications (background\ninformation on the origin of this statutory prohibition). \n6\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n12\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n13\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n14\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.15\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n16\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA.\nApplicant\u2019s guilty plea and sentence to confinement and probation under Georgia\u2019s first-\noffender law is a conviction under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. \nThe government contends, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.b, that federal law disqualifies\nApplicant from security-clearance eligibility. Applicant contends that his discharge under the\nGeorgia First Offender Act is not a conviction and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 requires the federal\ngovernment to honor the state\u2019s decision to treat the discharge as a non-conviction. The issue is\nwhether Applicant\u2019s  guilty plea and sentence to confinement and probation under Georgia\u2019s first-\noffender law constitutes a conviction for purposes of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the so-called Smith\nAmendment.  \n17\nSeveral years ago, Congress enacted a law that prohibited the Defense Department from\ngranting or renewing a security clearance for certain persons falling into one or more of four\n\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1) \u2013 (4) (2000).\n18\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1) (2004). \n19\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(d) (2004).\n20\n DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64, Sept. 12, 2006. \n21\n OI 64, \u00b6 2.e. \n22\n OI 64, \u00b6 3.f. \n23\n O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-8-60 \u2013 65. \n24\n O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-8-63.\n25\n State v. Wiley,  210 S.E.2nd 790, 791 (1974), on remand 213 S.E.2nd 15 (1975). \n26\n7\ncategories.  For a person with a criminal conviction, the current version of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 prohibits\n18\nthat Defense Department from granting or renewing a security clearance if \u201cthe person has been\nconvicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year.\u201d19\nAccordingly, an applicant who has been sentenced to more than one year, but instead served\nprobation, or who served less than a year of incarceration, is now eligible for a security clearance.\nThe law also authorizes a waiver in a meritorious case if there are mitigating factors. A\nwaiver of the prohibition is permitted for two of the four types of cases covered by the Smith\nAmendment: (1) where a person has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for more than\none year; and (2) where a person has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under\ndishonorable conditions.  Within DOHA, waivers are governed by Operating Instruction (OI) 64.\n20\n21\nIn summary, OI 64 implements the waiver authority granted to the Director of DOHA by the Under\nSecretary of Defense (Intelligence). Also, OI 64 addresses an administrative judge\u2019s responsibilities\nin handling a case. First, a judge\u2019s authority is limited to determining if the law applies to the facts\nof the case.  Second, if it does apply, no waiver recommendation of any kind will be made.\n22\n23\nThe plain language of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 does not define the term conviction. And the DOHA\nAppeal Board has not decided if a discharge under the Georgia First Offender Act is a conviction\nunder 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. Therefore, it is appropriate to look for guidance elsewhere. \nA sentence imposed under Georgia\u2019s First Offender Act allows a first-time offender to be\nplaced on probation or sentenced to confinement or both and serve out that probation or confinement\nwithout an adjudication of guilt.  Under Georgia law, Applicant\u2019s discharge under the first-offender\n24\nlaw is not a conviction because state law provides that a discharge under the act \u201cis not a conviction\nof a crime under the laws of this state. . . .\u201d  Consistent with the statute, the Georgia Supreme Court\n25\nhas held that a probationary sentence under the first-offender law, if completed without violation,\nis not a conviction.  Applicant argues that federal law requires that a state\u2019s interpretation of its laws\n26\nmust be given full faith and credit, and therefore, he does not have a conviction for purposes of 10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 986. \n\n United States v.

The full-faith-and-credit clause argument was made\u2014in a dissenting\nopinion\u2014in a sentencing appeal where the Sixth Circuit concluded that a sentence of probation\nunder Georgia\u2019s First Offender Act was a conviction that had become final for sentencing purposes.27\nLikewise, although the case did not involve 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the DOHA Appeal Board concluded\nthat 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 does not require DOHA Judges to refer to state law when deciding if collateral\nestoppel applies to state misdemeanor convictions.  The Appeal Board reasoned that although 28\n28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1738 applies to federal courts, it does not apply to federal executive branch agencies.  And\n29\nthe Appeal Board  noted practical reasons for not applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 to a security-clearance\ncase. The rationale expressed in that opinion would seem to apply here. \nIn cases involving 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the DOHA Appeal Board has held: (1) what constitutes\na conviction under the statute is a question of federal law, not state law; and (2) a state pardon does\nnot negate applicability of the statute.  The Appeal Board reviewed the statute and concluded that\n30\nbecause \u201cnothing in the statute indicates Congress intended the DoD to be bound by state law\nconcerning what constitutes a conviction, Applicant\u2019s reliance on details of state law is misplaced.\u201d31\nAlso, the Appeal Board concluded that in determining whether a person is convicted, a key\nconsideration was the practical reality of whether a person has been convicted as opposed to the\nparticular labels describing a person\u2019s status.  \n32\nRecently in 2005 and 2006, the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits have concluded that a\ndeferred adjudication under Georgia\u2019s first-offender law was a conviction for sentencing purposes.33\nLikewise, a deferred adjudication is a conviction for immigration purposes so long as it satisfies the\n\n 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A)(i) and  (ii) (two-part definition of conviction includes deferred adjudication of guilt\n34\nas long as there has been a finding of guilt or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and the court has imposed some form\nof punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien\u2019s liberty). \n Ali v. U.S. Attorney General, 443 F.3d 804, 809\u2013810 (11  Cir. 2006).  \n35\nth\n9\nrequirements of the immigration statute dealing with convictions.  For example, in 2006 the\n34\nEleventh Circuit ruled in a case where an alien pleaded guilty in 1993\u2014under Georgia\u2019s first-\noffender law\u2014to two counts of child molestation and was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation on each\ncount, to be served concurrently.  The court concluded that the alien\u2019s guilty plea and sentence to\n35\nprobation constituted a conviction for purposes of immigration law even though it was not\naccompanied by an actual adjudication of guilt.\nHere, the facts are undisputed. First, Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts of\nchild molestation. Second, he entered a negotiated guilty plea to one count of cruelty to children.\nThird, he was sentenced to two years of confinement followed by eight years of probation. Fourth,\nhe served approximately 20 months of confinement and then served probation until May 2007. Fifth,\nhis probation was terminated with his first-offender status in tact and he was discharged without an\nadjudication of guilt. Given these facts, the practical reality is that Applicant pleaded guilty to a\nfelony and the state court imposed a sentence that resulted in substantial punishment (confinement\nfor 20 months) and restraint on his liberty (multi-year probation). It has all the markings of a\nconviction, except an adjudication of guilt under the state\u2019s statutory scheme for first-time offenders.\nNevertheless, federal caselaw addressing the Georgia First Offender Act establishes that\ndeferred adjudications are convictions for sentencing and immigration purposes. A similar\nconclusion is warranted for a security-clearance case, which is a federal administrative proceeding\nthat is similar to immigration proceedings (legal proceedings without juries where the immigration\njudge, like a DOHA administrative judge, makes both findings of fact and conclusions of law; also,\nstrict rules of evidence do not apply and hearsay is admissible). To conclude otherwise would\ndisregard the practical reality of Applicant\u2019s case and elevate a label, based on state law, over the\nundisputed facts.\nFor the reasons discussed above, Applicant\u2019s guilty plea to one count of cruelty to children\nand sentence to confinement and probation under Georgia\u2019s First Offender Act is a conviction under\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 even though it was not accompanied by an actual adjudication of guilt. Specifically,\nApplicant\u2019s case falls within 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1) because the record evidence establishes that\nApplicant was incarcerated for not less than one year. Accordingly, the Defense Department may not\ngrant (or renew) a security clearance for Applicant without a waiver.\nB.\nAside from the disqualifying conviction, Applicant mitigated the sexual behavior and\ncriminal conduct security concerns. \nBecause the sexual behavior and criminal conduct allegations in the SOR are factually\ninterrelated, they are discussed together. The government contends that Applicant\u2019s history of sexual\nbehavior of a criminal nature raises security concerns under Guidelines D and J. Applicant contends\nthat he has presented sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation to mitigate any security\nconcerns. The question is whether Applicant\u2019s history of sexual behavior of a criminal nature with\n\n Revised Guidelines at 9 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n36\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n37\n Guideline D DC 1 (\u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted\u201d);\n38\nGuideline D DC 4 (\u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment\u201d); and\nGuideline J DC 1 (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d). \n10\na 13-year-old girl is consistent with eligibility for access to classified information under the clearly-\nconsistent standard.  \nUnder Guideline D, sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense,\nindicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation,\nor duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a\n36\nsecurity concern because criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. It calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.  \n37\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, security concerns are raised under Guidelines\nD and J. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history of sexual behavior of a criminal nature.\nHis sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl was serious misconduct, as reflected by the initial charges,\nthe negotiated guilty plea, and the sentence. Also, his misconduct reflects a gross lack of good\njudgment. When he engaged in this misconduct in late 1995, Applicant was 27 years old. As an\nadult, he knew what he was doing was wrong, yet he allowed the activity to occur, not once, but\nseveral times. His history of sexual behavior of a criminal nature raises security concerns under the\napplicable DCs of the guidelines.  \n38\nSeveral of the MCs under the guidelines apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. The applicable MCs are\nsummarized and discussed below.\nMC 2 under Guideline D\u2014the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014applies. Applicant engaged in the\nsexual activity with the girl in 1995, about 12 years ago. After pleading guilty in 1998, he served\nconfinement and probation. He complied with the terms of his probation, he completed treatment\nand counseling requirements, he has not engaged in further misconduct, he is gainfully employed\nas an engineer, and he now has a wife and child. Given these circumstances, his misconduct is not\nrecent and all indications are that is unlikely to recur. \nMC 1 under Guideline J\u2014so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014is similar to MC 2 under\nGuideline D. It applies using the same rationale. Given the passage of time and current\ncircumstances, his criminal conduct is not recent and it no longer casts doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nMC 4 under Guideline J\u2014there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation\u2014applies based\non the following: (1) his expression of remorse; (2) the passage of time since his release from\nconfinement without recurrence of any  misconduct; (3) his favorable employment record; (4) his\nstable family life as a husband and father; (5) his early termination of probation; and (6) his\n\n11\ndischarge under the state\u2019s first-offender law without an adjudication of guilt. Indeed, it appears that\nApplicant is a success story in the Georgia criminal-justice system. Taken together, these\ncircumstances are evidence of reform and rehabilitation. \nThe same circumstances have been considered under the whole-person concept. His track\nrecord as husband and father, a successful engineer, and a law-abiding citizen for the last several\nyears are persuasive evidence that the likelihood of additional misconduct is low. His demonstrated\nability to lead a responsible and productive life for a significant period after his release from\nconfinement in 2000 is evidence of reform and rehabilitation. This is a key factor, and it deserves\nsubstantial weight. And it should be noted that Applicant\u2019s misconduct might have never come to\nlight but for his self-reporting during the pre-employment polygraph examination. \nViewing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the sexual behavior and criminal conduct security concerns alleged in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a. Based on his conviction and serving 20 months of confinement,\nhowever, he is disqualified from having a security clearance granted (or renewed) by the Defense\nDepartment under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1). Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant based\nsolely on the Smith Amendment. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline D:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided upon the written record.  On January 16, 2008, after considering\nthe record, Administrative Judge Kathryn M. Braeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which he contends shows that he has\nmade sufficient progress in settling his outstanding debts to justify the granting of a security\nclearance.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.\nApplicant requested that his case be decided upon the written record.  He filed a four-page\nresponse to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) which indicated that he had paid off\nthe debts listed in SOR paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c).  The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to those\ntwo debts.  On appeal, Applicant presented new evidence which indicates that he is working with\na law firm to settle his remaining debts and has allocated $4,500 for that purpose.  The Board may\nnot consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its submission does not\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr.\n16, 2007).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had delinquent\ndebts and was still in the process of resolving his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the\nJudge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the limited mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The\nJudge found in favor of Applicant with respect to some of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge\nreasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient\nto overcome all the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n\n3\n4, 2007).

The SOR detailed reasons why the \nGovernment could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.1 \nThe SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial Considerations (Guideline F) in \nparagraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2 issued on December 29, \n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective September 1, \n2006.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of June 6, \n2007 (Item 4), a supplemental answer of July 18, 2007 (Item 5), and a supplemental \nanswer of August 27, 2007 (Item 6). In his answers he admitted some of the allegations, \ndenied some, and requested a decision on the written record.  \n \n \n     1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised.    \n     2 A copy of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines was sent with his Statement of Reasons (SOR). \nJanuary 16, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel on October 2, 2007, prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM).  The FORM sent to Applicant on October 4, 2007, detailed the Government\u2019s \nevidence and his right to respond. After he received the FORM on October 11, 2007, he \nprovided a response on October 29, 2007, (Exhibit A), which was within the 30-day time \nlimit specified. Exhibit A, his evidence, was forwarded on November 2, 2007 to \nDepartment Counsel who did not object to my consideration of it. The case was \nassigned to me on November 9, 2007.  Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (Exhibit A), \nrequested assignment of court appointed legal counsel; however, the Directive does not \nprovide for such appointments. He did have a right to a hearing before an administrative \njudge; however, he waived that right and requested a decision on the written record.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old and has worked as a mechanical engineer for a defense \ncontractor from August 2005 to present. Applicant completed an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigative Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance in \nSeptember 2005. (Item 7)   \n \nApplicant was a student from July 1997 to June 2004.  He received his Bachelor \nof Science and Master of Science degrees in September 2005. (Item 7) He was \nunemployed for several months around September 2005. He was previously employed \nat his university from January 2002 to September 2003 in the Civil Engineering \nDepartment, and from September 2003 to June 2005 in the Aerospace Department.  \n \n \nApplicant has not married and currently has no one financially dependent on him.  \nHe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1996. He has not served in the U.S. \nmilitary, but did register with the U.S. Selective Service System. (Item 7)   \n \nFinances \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on his e-QIP that he was over 180 days delinquent on \ndebt(s) and also over 90 days delinquent of debt(s) in the last seven years. He listed \nseven creditors: (1) phone bill for $710 from 2004; (2) credit card debt of $2,566 since \nApril 2004; (3) credit card debt of $1,971 from 2004; (4) credit card debt of $5,517 from \n2003; (5) credit card debt of $3,524 since 2003; (6) credit card debt of $2,834 from \n2003; and (7) credit card debt of $1,618 since 2003. Credit Reports confirmed Applicant \nhad ongoing issues of delinquent debt.  (Items 9, 10, 11)  \n \n \nIn response to a Financial Interrogatory sent to him, Applicant admitted constant \nfinancial problems despite a monthly net income of $3,230, expenses of $1,140, and a \nnet monthly remainder of $1,557. He acknowledged almost $30,000 in student loans, \nand he is making a $500 monthly payment per month. He also has a health club \nmembership with a monthly cost of $33. (Item 8) Despite his monthly discretionary \n\n \n3 \n \n \nincome of over $1,500, he has made little progress in resolving these ongoing, \ndelinquent debts. (SOR \u00b6 1.h) He has not established payment plans to address his \ndelinquent debts.  While he stated that he had hired an attorney and had the intent to \nresolve his debts, he failed to document that he has gone beyond preliminary steps to \nresolve five of his delinquent debts.    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts include several to credit card creditors (SOR \u00b61.a to \u00b61.g). He \nprovided evidence that in October 2007 he reached a settlement with Debtor #2 and \nresolved the $5,194 debt with a settlement payment of $3,700.  (SOR.\u00b6 l.b) (Exhibit A) \nHe said that the $1,027 debt to Creditor #3 was sold to a collection company, and \nsubsequently settled with a payment of $531.07. (SOR.\u00b6 l.c) (Item 4; Exhibit A) He \nfailed to document any financial counseling.  He did not adequately describe how he \nhas improved his financial practices, since obtaining a full-time job in 2005. \n \n \nApplicant contended he owes Creditor #4 $1,778, instead of $4,548 as alleged in \nthe SOR.  However, he failed to provide evidence to prove this contention.  (SOR.\u00b6 l.d)  \n(Items 4, 5, 6)  \n \nIn sum, Applicant has five unresolved, delinquent debts: almost $2,000 to \nCreditor #1 (SOR \u00b6 l.a), $4,548 to Creditor #4 (SOR \u00b6 l.d), $2,600 to Creditor #5 (SOR \u00b6 \nl.e), $1,618 to Creditor #6 (SOR \u00b6 l.f), and $3,945 to Creditor #7 (SOR.\u00b6 l.g).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in \nevaluating an individual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  In deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to \nclassified information, the mere presence or absence of any adjudication policy \ncondition is not decisive.   \n \n \nBased on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I \nweighed the relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines, and determined the following \nsecurity concern was relevant to my determination: \n \nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations \n \n18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including \nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to \ndemonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant's access to classified information. Then the Applicant presents evidence to \nrefute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive \nOrder 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an \napplicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do \nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial \noverall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those \ninferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of \nrecord.   \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security \nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an \nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.3 It is merely an indication that the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a security clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n      \n \nThe government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nreflecting several credit card debts totaling approximately $17,000 which remain unpaid.   \nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case \nagainst him.  He documented that he resolved two of these debts in 2007; however, he \nhas made no significant, demonstrable efforts to resolve the other five delinquent debts.  \nThus, his financial problems continue to raise security concerns.  While he reported he \nretained an attorney to help him resolve his debts, he failed to document any plan that \nhis attorney developed to resolve his delinquent debts. Nor did he document that he \nreceived or is receiving credit counseling as described under AG \u00b6 20(c) (stating, \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that security concerns may be mitigated when, \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., \n \n     3Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  \nApplicant described his unemployment in 2005, which is a specified mitigating condition; \nhowever, he did not adequately explain how he \u201cacted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d He continues to accumulate debt, and has failed to adequately address \nfive delinquent SOR debts, despite being employed since 2005. Applicant has \ndemonstrated that he paid two debts, but five remain unresolved. He failed to establish \nAG \u00b6 20(d), which provides \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d He did not adequately describe how he \nmaintained contact with his creditors, or why he did not make at least partial, good faith \npayments to his creditors, especially after being notified of the security concerns in the \nSOR. Thus, Applicant has not established a case in mitigation.  His failure to resolve his \ndelinquent SOR debts results in an ongoing security concern.   \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \n \nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d \nconcept, I conclude he is a sincere person who made some efforts to reform his \nfinancial practices.  However, his progress is insufficient.  His positive intentions do not \nsatisfy me that he is on the road to financial recovery. He failed to adequately \ndemonstrate he has changed his financial practices, except to acknowledge his efforts \nto operate on a cash basis as he has no credit. The potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress remains even though he has improved income and stable \nemployment. He did not submit his employment performance evaluations, or statements \nfrom his supervisors about his reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nIn sum, the likelihood of financial issues remains a security concern. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations. I rule For Applicant in subparagraphs \n1.b and 1.c because he settled and/or paid those two debts. For the remaining \nsubparagraphs, I rule against Applicant because he did not adequately address those \ndelinquent debts. \n \n \nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process \nsection, I make the following formal findings: \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, and 1.d through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nthe Applicant.  Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nKathryn Moen Braeman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Before 1999, Applicant enjoyed stable employment and debts in current status. In 1999, he ruptured three discs and encountered difficulty walking without extreme pain. He underwent surgery that year.

His recovery time from the surgery was six months, during which time, he could not return to work (R.T., at 21-22). Because the surgeon removed the wrong disc when he operated on Applicant in 1999, Applicant\u2019s back pain persisted throughout 1999. His physician advised him that the two remaining discs were still pushing against the sciatic nerve, and his lower spine was pressing hard against his spinal cord and needed to be corrected. So, in 1999 the physician scheduled Applicant for a second surgical procedure. During this operation, the physician nicked the membrane that holds the spinal fluid and caused leakage of his spinal fluid for several days, and eventually a cerebral hemorrhage (R.T., at 57-58).

Only one of his\nlisted debts does he dispute, and he documents resolving this debt favorably.  With respect to the\nremaining listed debts, Applicant has since paid them.  By his demonstrated good-faith efforts in\nresolving his lone disputed debts and paying the remaining extenuated ones, Applicant mitigates\nsecurity concerns associated with his delinquent debts.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 19, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on August 14, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on September 11, 2007.  A\nhearing was held on September 11, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four  exhibits; Applicant relied on two\nwitnesses (including himself) and five exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on September\n19, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record by kept open to afford him\nthe opportunity to supplement the record with documented payments of two of the creditors listed\nin the SOR.   For good cause demonstrated, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the\nrecord.  Within the time permitted, Applicant provided documentation of his payments to his medical\ncreditors and his credit card creditors.  The submissions were admitted without objection and\nassigned exhibit numbers F, G and H..\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 12 delinquent debts exceeding\n$10,000.00.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but three of the alleged debts and\nfurnished explanations of the medical problems he encountered that caused him to fall behind with\nhis debts. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant is a 57-year-old system engineer who seeks to retain his security clearance. The\nallegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBefore 1999, Applicant enjoyed stable employment and debts in current status.  In 1999, he\nruptured three discs and encountered difficulty walking without extreme pain.  He underwent surgery\nthat year.  Her treating surgeon removed one of the problem discs later that year.  However, this disc\nturned out not to be the one that was pushing on his sciatic nerve.  His recovery time from the\nsurgery was six months, during which time, he could not return to work (R.T., at 21-22).\nBecause the surgeon removed the wrong disc when he operated on Applicant in 1999,\nApplicant\u2019s back pain persisted throughout 1999.  His physician advised him that the two remaining\ndiscs were still pushing against the sciatic nerve, and his lower spine was pressing hard against his\nspinal cord and needed to be corrected.  So, in 1999 the physician scheduled Applicant for a second\nsurgical procedure.  During this operation, the physician nicked the membrane that holds the spinal\nfluid and caused leakage of his spinal fluid for several days, and eventually a cerebral hemorrhage\n(R.T., at 57-58).  As a result, the physician had to schedule Applicant for a third surgical procedure:\nto close and secure the hole that caused the leaking.  Applicant\u2019s recovery period for these additional\nsurgical procedures was almost a year, during which time he was out of work, and received only a\nportion of his regular pay (R.T., at 58-59).  This surgical procedure cost over $100,000.00, of which\nhis insurance company picked up only 80 per cent of the total cost (R.T., at 58).\nTo help him with his medical bills during a period of diminished income from his work,\nApplicant resorted to using his credit cards to.  Later in 1999, he did receive medical clearance to\nreturn to work on a part time basis, and did so for a short time.  When his company complained that\nit could not use his services on a part time basis, Applicant enlisted his treating physician to\nauthorize his return to full time employment (R.T., at 59).  No sooner did he report to his work site\non a full time basis than his company laid him off.  \nPhysically limited, Applicant could not find work in 2000 and turned first to his\nunemployment insurance.  After exhausting his eight remaining weeks of unemployment entitlement,\nApplicant applied for welfare benefits.  Once turned down, he proceeded to exhaust his 401(k) plan\nbefore reapplying for welfare benefits.\nDuring his period of extended recovery and diminished earnings, Applicant was able to keep\nup with most of his current debts, but was unable to cover his medical bills and credit cards.  Shortly\nafter accepting another job in the local area in 2002, he encountered a head-on automobile accident\nthat broke his back, caused a concussion, and totaled his own automobile.  This accident caused him\nto be out of work for almost a year and cease paying on his accumulated medical bills.  Applicant\u2019s\nmedical bills associated with his 2003 back surgery cost over $200,000.00, of which his insurance\ncompany covered all but 20 per cent, or $20,000.00 (R.T., at 58).  While Applicant did receive\n$100,000.00 in settlement from the offending motorist\u2019s insurance company, he netted only about\n$20,000.00 from this settlement after expenses and attorneys fees were deducted (R.T., at 61). \nBecause of the numerous side effects associated with his 2003 back operation, Applicant\nexperienced difficulties at work, and was forced to take considerable leave.  After exhausting his sick\nleave, the time he took off from work was uncompensated.  This loss of income put additional stress\n\n4\non his debt paying ability.  Altogether, Applicant accumulated some 12 delinquent debts between\n1999 and 2005 that until recently he has not been able to regularly address.  \nSince returning to work in 2006, Applicant has made steady progress in addressing his\ndelinquent debts.  He has been aided some in his repayment efforts by a small inheritance his wife\nreceived from her mother\u2019s estate following her mother\u2019s passing in May 2007 (compare ex. 2 with\nex. A; R.T., at 23).  A long disputed debt was reported in Applicant\u2019s May 2007 credit report (ex.\n2) and is listed in the SOR as creditor 1.a.  This debt has since been resolved favorably to Applicant\nand now reflects a zero balance (see ex. A; R.T., at 25-27). \nOf all the listed debts in the SOR, Applicant disputed the validity of just one of the debts:\ncreditor 1.a.  He is able to document favorable resolution of this debt (see ex. A; R.T., at 25-26).  To\naddress the listed medical debts in the SOR (which he acknowledges as his own), Applicant engaged\ntwo consolidation services: BC and CSC.  Through these services, Applicant and his wife are able\nto document payment in full of each of the listed medical debts (i.e., creditors 1.c through 1.i)\nthrough two lump sum payments (see exs. B, C, E and H; R.T., at 28-35).  The two credit card\naccounts Applicant had with creditors 1.j and 1.k were paid as well.  Payment of the first credit card\naccount is documented by exhibits D, E and F (R.T., at 35-43).  Payment of the second account\n(creditor 1.l) was previously made in July 2006 and is documented by exhibit G (running check\nregister).\nBy supplemental submissions, Applicant is able to document his satisfaction of his other\ncredit card debt (creditor 1.k) with a compromise payment of $1,680.54 and her $422.00 collection\naccount with creditor 1.l (see ex. F).  He documents payment, too, of his two AH debts covered by\ncreditors 1.b and 1.d, which in the aggregate total $3,262.00 (see exs. B, C, Gand H; R.T., at 26-27)).\nAnd he clarifies the ambiguity reflected in exhibit C with his corrected payment documentation that\nreflects a zero balance following his documented $1,170.06 payment in August 2007 (compare exs.\nC with H).\nWith his documented payments, Applicant has resolved all of her delinquent debts listed in\nthe SOR and is currently debt free.  He and his wife have no credit cards in delinquent status that\nthey are aware of.  He currently has $1,610.00 reinvested in his 401(k) account that he can draw on\nshould a financial emergency arise in the future.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n5\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively\ndemonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it\ncan deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a system engineer for a defense contractor who accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts over a six-year period spanning 1999 and 2005 during periods of unemployment\n\n6\nattributable to medical issues. Considered together, and without resolution, Applicant\u2019s\naccumulated debts raise security significant concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his prior inability to address these debts warrant\nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nFor the most part, Applicant\u2019s debts are attributable to (a) the substantial medical outlays\nhe became obligated to dispense to his medical providers to satisfy the cost-share portions of his\ninsurance policy and (b) his use of his credit cards to cover his family\u2019s personal needs during\nextended periods of time when he was recovering from his recurrent back surgeries and could not\nreturn to work.  \nSince returning to work on a full time basis in 2006, Applicant and his wife have made\nconsiderable progress in addressing his delinquent debts.  Aided by his wife\u2019s small inheritance, he\nhas been able to favorably resolve his one disputed debt and repay all of his other listed creditors\n(most of them of a medical nature) through two debt consolidated services he engaged.  Given his\nexhibited extenuating circumstances associated with his debilitating back ailments, and the\ncorresponding medical procedures top correct the identified problems, and the diminished resources\nhe and his wife had at their disposal to address their debts during related periods of unemployment,\nApplicant may rely on MC 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) of the Guidelines for financial considerations. \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on his presented repayment proofs.\nApplicant is able to demonstrate a credible dispute with one of his listed creditors (i.e., creditor 1.a),\nwhich has since been resolved, and completed repayments with his remaining creditors.  Age of the\ndebts at issue is covered by one of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations: MC 20(a)\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) has applicability, while not dispositive.  With respect to Applicant\u2019s lone disputed debt,\nMC 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the\ndispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) has applicability. \nWhile Applicant is not able to document any specific credit counseling, his election to\ninvolve two debt consolidation services to resolve his numerous medical debts reflects positively\non his willingness to explore creative ways to utilize his available resources to resolve his\noutstanding debts.  Based on his initiated efforts to date, prospects for his gaining important insights\n\n7\nin handling his finances in the future should he be confronted with other medical issues appear to\nbe promising.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a person\ncleared to access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the\nholder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial\ndifficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations and documented steps taken to resolve them, Applicant mitigates security concerns\nrelated to both his disputed debt and his proven debt delinquencies.  Favorable conclusions warrant\nwith respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.l of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nE2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.i:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.j:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.k:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.l:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 17, 2012, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 2, 2012, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of\n\n1The Judge found that the evidence is not clear as to the precise offense to which Applicant pled guilty.\nDecision at 2.\nfact; whether the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under\nGuideline C are not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: Applicant\nis an employee of a Government contractor.  Born in Panama, he and his mother moved to the U.S.\nwhen he was four years old.  The son of a U.S. service member, Applicant was a dual citizen of the\nU.S. and Panama.\nIn the late 1970s, Applicant joined the U.S. Marine Corps.  In 1980, while on active duty,\nApplicant and some friends set off fireworks near a bar, in order to intimidate some motorcyclists.\nApplicant and his friends fled, but they were stopped by a policeman.  A search of the car uncovered\na plastic gun, pyrotechnics, a nunchaku, a chain, and a bat.  Applicant was charged with inciting a\nriot, fleeing a police officer, possession of pyrotechnics, and carrying a concealed weapon.  He pled\nguilty to a misdemeanor1 and received a 30 day suspended sentence, 30 days probation, and a $30\nfine.\nIn 1983, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice for the offense of being absent from his place of duty.  A year later, Applicant smoked\nmarijuana.  This was discovered by means of a urinalysis, which yielded a positive result for the\ndrug.  Applicant submitted a request to be administratively discharged in lieu of trial by court-\nmartial.  The Marine Corps accepted the request and discharged Applicant with an Under Other\nThan Honorable Conditions (UOTHC) service characterization.\nIn August 1987, Applicant attended a party and smoked marijuana.  While waiting in his\ntruck for friends, Applicant fled approaching police officers.  Applicant threw bags out of his truck\nwhich, when recovered by the police, were revealed to contain marijuana.  Applicant was charged\nwith possession of marijuana with intent to distribute; possession of a controlled dangerous\nsubstance; possession of drug paraphernalia; and conspiracy.  Pleading guilty to possession of a\ncontrolled dangerous substance, Applicant was sentenced to a year of probation and to a fine.\nApplicant held a security clearance while serving in the Marines.  In 1987, he began working\nfor a contractor and submitted a security clearance application (SCA).  Applicant disclosed his\ncriminal history, as well as his use of marijuana, his positive drug test, and his discharge from the\nMarines in lieu of court-martial.  Applicant acknowledged that his discharge was UOTHC.\nThe Judge found, however, that on three subsequent SCAs, in 1993, 2005, and 2011,\nApplicant made false statements.  For example, when asked about his discharge from the military,\nin 1993 Applicant stated that he had received an Honorable Discharge.  In 2005, he answered \u201cno\u201d\nto a question that asked if he had ever received other than an Honorable Discharge.  In 2011, he\nstated that he had received a General Discharge.\n\nThe Judge found that Applicant made other false statements in his SCAs.  In 1993, for\nexample, he failed to disclose his uses of marijuana in 1984 and 1987.  He also denied that he had\never consulted with a mental health professional, although he had in fact done so in 1984.\nIn the SCAs completed in 2005 and in 2011, Applicant denied that he had ever been charged\nwith any felony offense or any offense related to drugs, failing to disclose his concealed weapons\ncharge, which was a felony, and failing to disclose his 1987 drug charges.  Applicant also denied\nhaving ever used drugs while holding a security clearance, which was false in light of his use of\nmarijuana while on active duty.\nIn interviews conducted in 1994, Applicant stated that he \u201cnever possessed [or] sold any\nillegal substances,\u201d and that he had never used illegal drugs.  He also stated that he had been\ndischarged from the Marines with a General Discharge.  \nLater that year, in conjunction with \u201ca polygraph-assisted interview,\u201d Applicant again stated\nthat he had received a General Discharge from the Marines, denied having received mental health\ntreatment, and denied involvement with illegal drugs.  In a post-test interview, he admitted having\nsmoked marijuana prior to his 1984 urinalysis and admitted his UOTHC discharge.  He also\nadmitted his use of marijuana in 1987.\nIn 2011, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted his 1987 use of marijuana\nbut did not mention the earlier incident that had occurred while he was in the Marines.  When asked\nto provide information about his 1987 arrest, he claimed only that the police had found a pipe in his\ntruck containing marijuana residue.  He did not mention his having thrown the bags of marijuana\nfrom his truck as he fled the police.  \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1987.  He has over 27 years of Government\nservice and has worked for contractors in support of the U.S. wars against illegal drugs and against\nterrorism.  \nApplicant claims that his answers to the SCA questions, interrogatories, and interview\nquestions were honest mistakes, due to poor memory, misunderstanding the questions, or an honest\nbelief that he did not have to disclose information about charges that had been dismissed.  He also\nclaims that he had been told that his discharge from the Marines would automatically be upgraded.\nThe Judge found that \u201cApplicant was less than candid and forthcoming at his hearing, sometimes\ncontradicting the evidence and his own testimony.\u201d  Decision at 5.\nApplicant presented evidence that he is a dedicated professional and an asset to his employer.\n\u201cHe has demonstrated a pattern of loyalty, dedication, competence, and reliability.\u201d  Id.  \n  In the Analysis, the Judge cleared Applicant of the sole allegation under Guideline C, which\npertained to his having possessed a Panamanian passport.  He also entered favorable findings\nregarding one Guideline E allegation, concerning a charge of car theft.  However, in analyzing the\nbalance of the Guideline E allegations, the Judge concluded that they set forth security concerns\nwhich Applicant had failed to mitigate.  Regarding the many false statements that the Judge found\nApplicant to have made, he concluded that they were deliberate.  The Judge stated that this\n\nconclusion was made in light of all of the evidence in the record and in light of Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony and demeanor at the hearing.  The Judge stated that these false statements demonstrate\na lack of judgment and candor and that they evidence Applicant\u2019s dishonesty and his unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence was\nnot sufficient to mitigate the security concerns in his case.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that his false answers were deliberate.\nWhen, as here, an applicant has denied an intent to deceive, the Government must provide\nsubstantial evidence that the false statements or omissions were deliberate.  Substantial evidence\nmeans \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See\nISCR Case No. 09-06218 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2011).  \nRecord evidence of (1) the number of Applicant\u2019s false statements, which were made over\na period of several years; (2) his inconsistent statements; (3) his experience in completing SCAs;\n(4) the clarity of the questions themselves; and (5) the Judge\u2019s credibility determination support the\nJudge\u2019s finding that Applicant intentionally failed to provide truthful information during the\nprocessing of his various SCAs.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.21: \u201c[T]he Appeal Board shall give deference\nto the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge.\u201d  \nApplicant cites to record evidence of his having held a clearance for many years without\nincident or concern and that he has had prior favorable adjudications despite the presence of some\nof the adverse information at issue in this case.  However, we have held that prior decisions to grant\nor retain a clearance do not undermine the legal sufficiency of a Judge\u2019s decision.  The U.S.\nGovernment is not precluded from making an adverse clearance decision despite prior favorable\ndeterminations.  Neither is a good security record a bar to an unfavorable decision.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 08-05344 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb 3, 2010).  In this case, the Judge made findings about the\nevidence that Applicant has cited, but he provided a reasonable explanation for his adverse decision.\nApplicant has failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the\nrecord.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-02311 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2012).  \nApplicant notes the effect that a clearance denial may have upon his employment.  However,\nthe adverse impact of an unfavorable decision is not relevant in evaluating clearance eligibility.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 10-03757 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2011).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that\na clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d\nDepartment of the Navy v.

A search of the car \nrevealed a plastic gun, pyrotechnics, a nunchaku, a chain, and a bat. Applicant was \narrested and charged with inciting a riot, fleeing from a police officer, possession of \npyrotechnics, and carrying a concealed weapon. It is not clear from the evidence to \nwhat charge(s) Applicant pled guilty. He testified that he pled to a misdemeanor offense \nand was sentenced to a 30 day suspended sentence, 30 days probation, and a $30 \nfine. His weapons were confiscated. (GE 2) \n \nIn 1983, Applicant received non-judicial punishment for being absent from his \nplace of duty. In 1984, Applicant (then a staff sergeant (E-6)) illegally smoked \nmarijuana, and 15 days later he tested positive on a urinalysis test. He was offered trial \nby court-martial; however, he elected an administrative discharge in lieu of trial by a \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncourt-martial. Applicant was administratively discharged and his service was \ncharacterized as under other than honorable conditions. (GE 3, GE 4)  \n \nIn August 1987, Applicant and a friend attended a party and smoked \u201cone or two\u201d \nmarijuana cigarettes. While waiting for his friend in his truck, Applicant saw police \nofficers approaching his truck and sped away. He was pursued by police officers. The \npolice observed Applicant throwing plastic bags out of his truck and emptying a plastic \nbag while fleeing. Police officers recovered two plastic zip lock bags containing \nmarijuana. They seized from his vehicle another plastic zip lock bag with marijuana \nresidue and one pipe with marijuana residue. Applicant was charged with possession of \nmarijuana with intent to distribute, possession of a controlled dangerous substance, \npossession of drug paraphernalia, and conspiracy. Applicant pled guilty to possession \nof a controlled dangerous substance. He was sentenced to one year probation and to \npay a fine. (GE 4, GE 7) \n \nIn 1991, Applicant purchased a vehicle and used his employer as a cosigner on \nthe loan. When Applicant decided to leave the job, his employer falsely accused him of \nstealing the vehicle. He was arrested and charged with grand theft auto, a felony. The \ncharge was later nolle prossed. Applicant filed and won a civil suit against his employer, \nand he was awarded $10,000 in damages. (AE 2) I find allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.d \nunsubstantiated. \n \nApplicant was granted a security clearance at the secret level in 1980, while he \nwas serving in the Marine Corps. His access to classified information was terminated \nupon his discharge. In November 1987, Applicant started working for a government \ncontractor and submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In his November 1987 \nSCA, Applicant disclosed his criminal history, including his August 1987 arrest, charges, \nand conviction related to the illegal possession of marijuana. Additionally, he disclosed \nthat in 1984, he illegally smoked marijuana, tested positive on a drug-screening test, \nand lost his career in the Marine Corps. Applicant disclosed that he asked for an \nadministrative discharge in lieu of a court-martial, and that his discharge was \ncharacterized as under other than honorable conditions. \n \nA review of Applicant\u2019s past SCAs revealed that he repeatedly falsified his \nanswers to certain SCA questions. In Section 9 of his November 1993 SCA, Section 19 \nof his August 2005 SCA, and Section 15 of his March 2011 SCA, Applicant was asked \nto state the type of discharge he received when he was discharged from the Marine \nCorps in 1984. In his 1993 SCA Applicant stated that he received an honorable \ndischarge. In his 2005 SCA he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether he had ever \nreceived other than an honorable discharge from the military. And, in his 2011 SCA he \nstated that he received a general discharge.  \n \nSection 20 of his November 1993 SCA asked Applicant whether he had ever \nused or possessed any illegal drugs, including marijuana. He answered \u2018No\u201d and failed \nto disclose his 1984 and 1987 use and possession of marijuana. He also was asked \nwhether he had consulted or been counseled by any mental health professional. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose that he consulted with a mental health \nprofessional in 1984. \n \nOn June 19, 1994, Applicant provided a sworn statement to a government \ninvestigator explaining the circumstances that led to his 1980 charges and conviction, \nhis 1987 conviction for possession of marijuana, his 1991 charge for grand theft auto, \nthe characterization of his 1984 discharge, his psychological evaluation and treatment \nwhile in the service, and his use of illegal drugs in the service. During the interview, \nApplicant told the investigator that he \u201cnever possessed nor sold any illegal \nsubstances,\u201d and \u201cas to use of drugs, I have never used or in any other way been \ninvolved with any drugs, narcotics, or controlled substances, except for prescription \ndrugs for medication.\u201d He also stated that because he was an E-6, he was discharged \nwith a general discharge under honorable conditions. \n \nIn October 1994, Applicant participated in a polygraph-assisted interview. During \nthe initial part of the interview, Applicant claimed that he received a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions in 1984, denied receiving any treatment with a mental \nhealth professional, and denied any use or involvement with any illegal drugs. During \nthe post-polygraph interview, Applicant admitted smoking marijuana two weeks before \nhis 1984 urinalysis test, and knowingly receiving a discharge under other than \nhonorable conditions in 1984. Applicant also admitted smoking three marijuana \ncigarettes before he was approach by the police in October 1987, and throwing the \nplastic bags containing marijuana from his vehicle. He claimed the marijuana belonged \nto a friend. In his post-polygraph sworn statement, Applicant apologized for not relaying \nall the events in his SCA. (GE 10) \n \nSection 23 of his August 2005 SCA and Section 22 of his March 2011 SCA \nasked Applicant whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony \noffense or of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to these \nquestions on both SCAs and failed to disclose that in 1980 he was charged with \ncarrying a concealed weapon. Additionally, he failed to disclose that in 1987 he was \narrested and charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance (marijuana), \npossession with the intent to distribute marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, \nand conspiracy, and that he pled guilty and was convicted of possession of marijuana.  \n \nSection 24 of Applicant\u2019s August 2005 SCA and Section 23 of his March 2011 \nSCA asked (in pertinent parts) whether he had ever illegally used a controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both SCA \nquestions and failed to disclose that in 1984 he used marijuana while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nIn 2007, Applicant requested and was issued Panamanian passport to facilitate \nleaving his minor daughter with her mother, a citizen and resident of Panama, while he \nwas deployed to Kuwait in support of U.S. troops. Applicant was first informed of the \nGovernment\u2019s foreign preference concerns raised by his possession of the foreign \n\n \n5 \n \n \npassport when he received the SOR in May 2012. In June 2012, he renounced his \nPanamanian citizenship and surrendered his passport. (Answer to the SOR)  \n \nIn November 2011, Applicant submitted sworn answers to a DOHA interrogatory. \nHe was asked whether he had ever illegally used drugs, including marijuana. Applicant \ndisclosed he used marijuana in 1987; however, he failed to disclose his 1984 use of \nmarijuana. Applicant was also asked to give information regarding his 1987 arrest and \ncharges for possession and distribution of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, \nand conspiracy. He stated that the only item found in his vehicle was a pipe with \nmarijuana residue. He failed to disclose that in addition to the pipe, the police seized \ntwo plastic zip lock bags containing marijuana that he threw from the truck and one \nfound in his truck.  \n \nApplicant has worked for government contractors, and possessed a security \nclearance, from 1987 to present. He was hired by his current employer, a government \ncontractor, in September 2009. He performs duties as an information technology \ntechnician. He has over 27 years of service to the government, including his time in the \nservice. After 1987, he dedicated his life to work for several government contractors \nsupporting the U.S. wars against illegal drugs and terrorism. He averred that he made \nhonest mistakes in his answers to the SCAs because he either did not remember the \nfacts, misunderstood the questions asked, or believed the charges were dismissed and \nhe did not have to disclose the requested information. He also claimed that he was told \nthat his discharge from the Marine Corps would be automatically upgraded. Applicant \nwas less than candid and forthcoming at his hearing, sometimes contradicting the \nevidence and his own testimony. (Tr. 75, 106-107) \n \nApplicant submitted numerous certificates of achievement and training \ncertificates. These documents and his character statements establish that he is \nconsidered to be a dedicated professional and an asset to his employer. He has \ndemonstrated a pattern of loyalty, dedication, competence, and reliability.  \n \nPolicies \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable must \nbe considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b). Clearance decisions are not a determination of the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the security concern about foreign preference stating: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10 indicates four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country;  \n \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant, a U.S. citizen, applied for and was issued a Panamanian \npassport. Foreign preference disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a) and (b) are supported \nby the evidence. If these conditions are not mitigated they would disqualify Applicant \nfrom possessing a security clearance. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that could mitigate the security concerns for \nforeign preference: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \n \nApplicant became aware of the Government\u2019s foreign preference concerns raised \nby his possession of the foreign passport when he received the SOR in May 2012. In \nJune 2012, he renounced his Panamanian citizenship and surrendered his passport. \n(Answer to the SOR) Foreign preference mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) \napply and mitigate the security concern.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nBetween 1980 and 1987, Applicant was involved in criminal misconduct that \nincluded carrying a concealed weapon, and the illegal possession and use of marijuana. \nHe was administratively discharged from the Marine Corps with a discharge \ncharacterized as under other than honorable conditions. Thereafter, Applicant falsified \nSCAs in 1993, 2005, 2011 when he deliberately omitted or made false statements about \nthe circumstances related to the 1980, 1984, and 1987 criminal incidents, and the \ncharacterization of his 1984 discharge. Additionally, Applicant made false statements to \na government investigator in 1994, and falsified answers to a DOHA interrogatory in \n2011 minimizing his past criminal behavior. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s false statements and falsifications trigger the applicability of the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant claimed that his omissions and falsifications were caused by honest \nmistakes because he was either confused by the questions, did not remember the \nincidents, or was due to the mistaken believe that his discharge would be automatically \nupgraded. Having observed his demeanor while testifying and analyzed his testimony in \nlight of all the evidence available, Applicant\u2019s claims of honest mistakes are not credible. \n \n \nIn his November 1987 SCA Applicant disclosed that he illegally smoked \nmarijuana in 1984, tested positive on a drug screening test, and was administratively \ndischarged under other than honorable conditions. He also disclosed the circumstances \nrelated to his August 1987 arrest, charges, and conviction for illegal possession of \nmarijuana. Notwithstanding, in his 1993, 2005, and 2011 SCAs, Applicant omitted or \nmade false statements about the characterization of his discharge, and the \ncircumstances related to his use and possession of marijuana in 1984 and 1987. \nAdditionally, in June 1994 and October 1994, Applicant made similar false statements to \ngovernment investigators. \n \n \nAfter a polygraph-assisted interview in October 1994, Applicant admitted making \nfalse statements to government investigators regarding the characterization of his \ndischarge and the circumstances related to his use and possession of marijuana in \n1984 and 1987. Notwithstanding his November 1987 SCA disclosures and his \nadmission to making false statements in October 1994, Applicant continued his \nomissions and false statements in his 2005 and 2011 SCAs and in his answers to \nDOHA interrogatories in 2011.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. Considering the record as a whole, I find that none of the Guideline E \nmitigating conditions apply. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply because he did not correct his \nfalsifications before he was confronted with the facts. On the contrary, even after he \nwas confronted during post-polygraph interviews with his falsifications in 1994, \nApplicant continued to make false statements and falsified SCAs in 2005 and 2011. AG \n\u00b6 17(c) does not apply because making a false statement is a felony in violation of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Additionally, he repeatedly falsified his SCAs and made false statements \nto government investigators. The remaining mitigating conditions are not raised by the \nfacts and are not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s false statements and falsifications show lack of judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, and an unwillingness or inability to comply with rules and \nregulations. His questionable behavior raises questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and under the whole-person concept. \nAG \u00b6 2(c). Applicant is a dedicated father. He has approximately 27 years of service to \nthe U.S. Government. He is considered to be an outstanding employee and made \nsignificant contributions to his employers. He is dedicated, diligent, and displays \nexcellent professional knowledge and abilities.  \n \nNotwithstanding his favorable evidence, Applicant\u2019s repeated falsifications and \nfalse statements raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. He mitigated the Guideline C security concern, but failed \nto mitigate the Guideline E concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.e - 2.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In November 1998, a $360 state\ntax lien (SOR 1.a) was filed against Applicant.  Applicant asserts this debt was paid in 1998 or 1999.\nThe lien appears on all four credit reports.  She owes two telephone bills for $250 (SOR 1.b) and\n$93 (SOR 1.c).  In October 2006, She had correspondence from the collection agency in which the\nagency stated it was willing to accept payments on the debts. (Gov Ex 6)  There is no evidence\nApplicant accepted the offer or made payments on the debts. \nApplicant had a $47 dishonored check (SOR 1.d), which has been paid. (Gov ex 7) She is\nindebted to a collection agency for $948.  She admits the debt, but is unsure about the debt or the\n\n4\ninitial creditor of the debt.  The debt was originally $513, but is now $971 (SOR 1.e).  (Gov Ex 7,\n8, and 9) \nApplicant has a delinquent $9,410 credit card debt (SOR 1.f).  In December 2006, she\nreceived correspondence about the debt (Gov Ex 6), but no evidence of payment has been made.\nIt appears on her credit reports at an initial amount of $8,316. (Gov Ex 7, 8 and 9).\nApplicant owes $8,510 on a collection account (SOR 1.g), which has not been paid. (Gov\nEx 9) She owes $2,678 for student loans (SOR 1.h). In July 2006, she entered into an agreement to\npay $50 per month on the loans.  Payments for July 2006 through December 2006 are in the record.\n(Gov Ex 6) The loans appear on her July 2007 credit report and are not listed as delinquent. (Gov\nEx 10)\nApplicant owes $1,669 on a charged off credit card (SOR 1.i). (Gov Ex 7, 8) She is $241\ndelinquent on a store credit card (SOR 1.j) and a $295 cell phone account (SOR 1.k). Both accounts\nwere placed for collection and remain unpaid. (App Ex 7). \nIn June 2005, Applicant completed her SF 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions.\nQuestion 36 asked if any liens had been placed against her for failing to pay her taxes. She answered\n\u201cno\u201d to the question even though a state tax lien was filed against her in November 1998.  She says\nshe forgot about the lien and would not have considered it as placed against her property.  She also\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 38, which asked if she had been more than 180 days delinquent on any\ndebts.  She gives no reason for her answer.\nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, dated August 2006, sets forth Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline F, financial considerations, and\nGuideline E, personal conduct.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n5\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her\nfinances so as to meet her financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owes approximately $22,000 on nine delinquent debts.  Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d apply. \nApplicant has paid a $77 debt for a dishonored check (SOR 1.d) and made $50 per month\npayments on the student loan obligation (SOR 1.h) for six months.  Additionally, Applicant\u2019s July\n2007 credit report does not list her student loans as currently being past due or delinquent. I find for\nApplicant as to these two debts. \n\n6\nMitigating Condition (MC) 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances,\u201d has very limited applicability.  Applicant asserts she is a single mother and not\nreceiving financial support from the children\u2019s father. Additionally, her daughter was in a car\naccident resulting in medical debts. The impact of these events on her finances is not further\ndescribed.  None of the debts in question are related to medical bills.  Applicant has failed to explain\nhow the events caused the financial problems. Without additional information, it is impossible to\nfind that the events caused the debts or that Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n There is no evidence Applicant has sought financial counseling or demonstrated a positive\nchange in her financial management. The majority of the debts remain unpaid. There is no indication\nthe problem is being resolved or under control.  After monthly expenses, Applicant has only $152\nfor all unexpected or unlisted expenses which would include repayment on the nine debts.  MC 2(c)\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply. \nMC 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d apply except to the dishonored check and student loan obligations.  For MC 20(d)\nto apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and evidence of a good-\nfaith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling her debts is needed, which is not\npresent here. Applicant has paid $377 on her debts since being questioned about her debts in January\n2007. (Gov Ex 6) The majority of her debts remain unpaid. There is no plan for paying her\ndelinquent obligations. \nRegarding personal conduct, the concern is \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  DC 16(a) \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\nIn June 2005, when completing her SF 86, she failed to list a tax lien.  She says she forgot\nabout it and had she remembered she would not have considered it as being placed against her\nproperty.  Before a state tax lien is filed, Applicant receives a number of letters from the state, which\nwould have put her on notice of the lien.  Applicant states she believes the debt was paid in 1998\nor 1999.  Frequently a state tax lien is paid by garnishment or interception of a subsequent tax year\u2019s\nrefund. This may have been paid, but appears on all the credit reports in the record. The lien was\nfiled six and a half years before she completed her SF 86.  The filing of a tax lien is a significant\nevent, but the amount was only $360.  She could easily have forgotten about it.  I find for her as to\nSOR 2.a.\nHowever, Applicant also answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if she had ever been more than 180 days\ndelinquent during the previous seven years.  Due to the significant nature of her debts she should\nhave disclosed her delinquent debts on her SF 86.  Applicant failed to present a good explanation\n\n7\nwhy she did not answer the question correctly. None of the mitigating conditions apply to her false\nanswer.\nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. I find against Applicant as to financial considerations and personal conduct.\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not\nattain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security\nclearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based\non applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under the\nApplicant\u2019s current circumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should the Applicant be\nafforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent\nobligations, established compliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations,\nshe may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. However, a clearance at\nthis time is not warranted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nClaude R.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCaroline H. Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems began when he did not pay his federal tax for 2003\nand 2004. The financial difficulties continued with Applicant\u2019s abuse of five credit cards in 2003 and\n2004, and 2005. In addition, he deliberately falsified his security form in September 2005 when he\ncertified he had no overdue debts. Though he had to be confronted with the debt information before\nhe admitted the listed debts, the unambiguous acceptance of his falsehoods and actions he took to\nrectify the debt problems gives me sufficient grounds to find the financial and the personal conduct\nguidelines in his favor. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\ntrustworthiness position for Applicant. On January 19, 2007, under Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5200.6, with revised Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its security concerns\nraised under the financial considerations guideline (Guideline F), and the personal conduct guideline\n(Guideline E) of the Directive. In his answer dated February 20, 2007, Applicant requested a decision\nbe made on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on May 9, 2007. After receiving the FORM on May\n16, 2007, Applicant provided his response on June 13, 2007, the same day the case was assigned to\nme for decision. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains seven allegations under the financial considerations guideline, and one\nallegation under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all the financial and personal\nconduct allegations. He provided documentation indicating he enrolled in a debt consolidation plan\non March 27, 2006 and placed all listed debts in the plan. In response to the personal conduct\nallegation, Applicant stated, \u201cI admit I did lack in judgment in providing false answer(s) to the\nquestion(s) of any delinquent [debt] over 90 to 180 days. I would ask that you look at my last\nPerformance Review, I\u2019m a hard worker, who has provide(ed) service for this Government for 25\nyears (.) Performance review Exhibit 2(.)\u201d\nApplicant is 42 years old, and since September 2005, has been employed as a supply\ntechnician by a defense contractor. He seeks a security clearance.\nFinancial Considerations\n\n3\nSOR 1.a. identifies a credit card account for $874.00 that became delinquent in July 2005.\nSOR 1.b. refers to a past due, utility debt in the amount of $419.00. The debt was transferred for\ncollection in October 2005. Regarding SOR 1.c., the collection agency took over a credit card\naccount ($4,605.00) in September 2005. A credit card account (SOR 1.d.) in the amount of\n$1,641.00 was transferred to a collection agency in July 2005. SOR 1.e. represents a credit card\naccount that was charged off at an unidentified time. Another credit card was charged off in July\n2004. The last financial allegation is a delinquent federal tax debt amounting to $2,984.99 for tax\nyears 2003 and 2004. \nThough applicants generally provide reasons for their financial problems, Applicant provided\nno explanation in his answers to interrogatories (Item 6), or his SCA (Item 5), or his answers to the\nSOR (Item 4). His only explanation (reply to FORM) he furnished was for the federal tax arrearage\nwhere he explained he did not make the suitable adjustments in his pay when he transitioned from\nhis military to his civilian job. The CBR (Item 7) dated January 16, 2007, supports a factual finding\nall his delinquent debts (except SOR 1.b.) are credit card accounts. I find Applicant abused five\ncredit cards, and these cards became delinquent (Applicant stopped making payments on the cards)\nby September 2005. Item 7 also reflects that as of the publication of the SOR (January 16, 2007),\nApplicant\u2019s past due debt totaled $16,652.99. (SOR 1.a. through 1.g.) Applicant also noted in his\nreply to the FORM that he had counseling. The documentation shows very little evidence of\nstructured, financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s primary reason for joining the debt plan was to\nconsolidate his debt payments in a plan. Though he may have received written material in the debt\nresolution kit, he did not include that information with the materials he supplied to the government.\nFinancial counseling usually includes detailed instruction in understanding and implementing\nfinancial tools that help a person manage his finances. \nWhile there is insufficient evidence to support a factual finding about whether Applicant\u2019s\nson is a direct cause of his financial indebtedness, there are few findings I can make about the son.\nFirst, Applicant\u2019s son is 21 years old. See, Item 5. Second, the utility company and Applicant\u2019s son\nare located in the same state. According to Applicant\u2019s expense sheet, Item 6), he pays $700.00\n(about 18% of the monthly expenses) a month for his son\u2019s apartment and car installment loan. \nOn December 20, 2006 (Item 6), Applicant indicated he placed all the overdue debts in the\nconsolidation plan on March 27, 2006. He also included a portion of the explanatory paperwork that\nplan officials provided him with a limited power of attorney (attorney-in-fact) giving them the power\nto settle or resolve the past due debts. Plan officials also sent Applicant a debt solutions kit that\noutlined the objectives of the plan. The details of the solutions kit were not provided. In Item 6,\nApplicant also furnished a copy of his check in December 2006 indicating he earned about $1,491.00\nevery two weeks, and his wife earned about $367.00 a week. \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant provided a printout of payments from his debt plan.\nAccording to plan objectives (Item 8), all payments goals have been met. Applicant has funded 14\npayments under the plan between April 2006 and May 2007. The first three payments were $212.01,\nand the last 11 were $103.25.\n\n \u201cConsistently meets and sometimes exceeds all relevant performance standards. Makes contributions, hs strong\n1\ntechnical and interpersonal skills or has achieved significant improvement in these areas.\u201d (Item 4)\n4\nPersonal Conduct\nOn September 14, 2005, Applicant certified his SCA. In response to questions 28.a. (in the\nlast seven years have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debts?) and 28.b. (are you currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debt), Applicant answered \u201cNO.\u201d As noted earlier in Findings of\nFact, Applicant admitted he lied, but asked that his job performance and his 25-year record with the\nfederal government be taken into consideration. In viewing his job performance report for five\nmonths of 2006, I read his overall assessment is \u201cexceeds expectations.\u201d  Applicant received good\n1\nratings on quality of work, quantity of work, initiative, cooperation, safety job knowledge. No rating\nwas entered for the leadership category. The only information about Applicant\u2019s 25 year record in\nthe federal government is located in Item 5 (SCA). That information shows he was in the United\nStates Army from 1982 to March 2003, and he received an Honorable Discharge. Also, he was\nemployed as a supply technician at the Veterans Administration Hospital from 2002 to 2005. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nFinancial Considerations\n\n5\nThe focus of this guideline is handling money matters in a financially responsible manner.\nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E)\nThis guideline addresses conduct during the security investigation that involves questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness or dishonesty. \nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nThe safeguarding of classified information is an-around-the-clock responsibility requiring\nthe exercise of good judgment. Hence, a person should be as vigilant in his own affairs as he is in\ncomplying with all security regulations and policies. Not paying bills on time demonstrates poor\njudgment while placing the individual in a risk-filled position of potentially committing acts of poor\njudgment to generate funds. The government\u2019s evidence calls for the application of FC disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 19. a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and 19. c. (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) The fact that the listed debts have not been paid establishes FC DC 19. a. The\nage of the tax debt establishes FC DC 19. c., verifying a history of indebtedness dating to 2003. I\nconclude FC DC 19 g. (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required\nor the fraudulent filing of the same) does not apply since there is no allegation Applicant did not file\nreturns. The surrounding circumstances lead me to conclude he simply did not pay his taxes. \nFC mitigating condition (MC) 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) is the most appropriate condition to apply in this case.\nFC MC 20. a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) must be removed from consideration since most of\nApplicant\u2019s past due debt became delinquent less that three years ago. FC MC 20 c. (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and /or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is under control) has limited application because Applicant had only been in the debt plan\nfor about eight months before the publication of the SOR. The plan documentation indicates that\nApplicant has been given very little financial counseling. Though more documentation was provided\nby plan officials, specifically in the debt solutions kit, Applicant did not furnish that information.\nEven though I do not know whether all listed creditors are included in the plan, I find in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor under the FC guideline. My conclusion is based on the action he took to remedy his\nindebtedness even before he received the SOR. My conclusion is buttressed by the June 2007\nevidence indicating he has faithfully made all payments since the inception of the plan in March\n2006.\n\n6\nPersonal Conduct (PC) \nIn September 2005, Applicant demonstrated dishonesty during the course of the security\ninvestigation. He did not reveal he had been dishonest until he received the SOR in January 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct falls within the scope of PC DC 16. b. (deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer or an investigator) \nThough there is no mitigating condition that clearly \u201cfills the bill\u201d for Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nfalsification of material information from his SCA in September 2005, I am satisfied that PC MC\n17. d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) successfully assists Applicant overcome his dishonest behavior. First, he credibly\nacknowledged his dishonesty without couching that acknowledgment in language that casts a pall\nover the sincerity of the admission. Though Applicant has not received the type of counseling\ncontemplated by the condition, he has taken positive steps to eliminate the stressors (debt burden)\nthrough enrollment in a debt plan, and has not missed a payment. While candor lapses are rarely\ntolerated or excused, Applicant has mitigated his dishonesty by accepting his isolated, dishonorable\nconduct, and taking the necessary action to eliminate his debt problems. \nViewing the circumstances of this case through the general factors of the whole person,\nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations that dates to 2003 when he did not\npay federal taxes. More recently, the CBRs show Applicant\u2019s abuse of credit cards. His four year\nhistory of failing to meet his financial obligations and inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts\nraises serious trustworthiness concerns. However, Applicant made a critical decision in March 2006\nthat justifies my decision to find in his favor under th FC guideline. Even before he received the\nSOR, and before he received the interrogatories, Applicant began his debt consolidation plan. He has\nmade 14 successive payments under the plan between March 2006 and June 2007. I am confident\nApplicant will continue with the plan until his debts are paid. I am confident that Applicant had his\nwife will pursue counseling in the plan to determine how they can stay on top of their financial\nobligations in the future. \nUnder the whole person concept, I conclude Appellant\u2019s falsification has been mitigated as\nwell. While he did not come forward with the dishonesty before being confronted with the delinquent\ndebts, he clearly accepted his lack of forthrightness. The documented steps Applicant has taken to\neliminate the debts and the taxes persuade me to believe Applicant will not engage in this type of\nnegative behavior in the future.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a.\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\nSubparagraph b.\nFor the Applicant. \nSubparagraph c.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph f.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph g. \nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph a.\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

[his foreign relatives] . . . and\nthe interests of the U.S.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 16 , 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about February 6, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on April 10, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued\non April 12, 2007, and the case was heard on May 8, 2007.  The Government submitted documentary\nevidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The\ntranscript (TR) was received on May 17, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's\nperceived Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence militate against the granting of a security\nclearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis for all of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 52 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant came to the U.S. from Israel in 1986, over 20 years ago, to find a better life\nfor his family (TR at page 15 line 2 to page 16 line 14).  He became a U.S. citizen in 1996 (TR at\npage 19 lines 19~25).  His wife is also naturalized, but his three children are native born Americans\n(TR at page 17 line 14 to page 19 line 1).  All of the Applicant\u2019s net worth, nearly $1,000,000, is in\nthe U.S. (TR at page 21 line 24 to page 23 line 1).\n\n3\n1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant has surrendered his Israeli passport, which he acquired in 1998,\nafter he was naturalized (TR at page 25 line 6 to page 26 line 23, at page 33 line 22 to page 34 line\n18, Government Exhibit (GX) 3, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  He traveled to Israel seven times,\nusing this Israeli passport, to visit his parents (TR at page 20 lines 1~20, and GX 3).  His last visit\nwas in 2005 (Id).\n\n4\nGuideline B - Foreign influence\n2.a.  The Applicant\u2019s 80 year old parents are retired and live in Israel (TR at page 23 lines\n12~24, at page 27 line 8 to page 28 line 15, at page 30 lines 8~19 and GX 1 at pages 14~16).  His\nfather is a retired \u201cIrrigation Engineer,\u201d and his mother is a \u201chousekeeper\u201d (Id).\n2.b.  The Applicant\u2019s sister works in a private hospital as an \u201cX-Ray Technician\u201d (TR at page\n31 line 13 to page 32 line 5).  The Applicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-vis any of his Israeli\nrelatives (TR at page 29 line 5 to page 30 line 7, and at page 32 lines 16~24).\nAs the Applicant has Israeli relatives, I must also consider the country of Israel.  Israel is a\nparliamentary democracy who\u2019s prime minister heads the government and exercises executive\npower.  Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy that is growing at about 5.2% per\nyear, and the U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner.  Almost half of Israel\u2019s exports are high tech and\nits major industrial sectors include high-technology electrical and biomedical equipment.  The\nNational Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage lists Israel as one of the active collectors of proprietary information.  The most\nrecent Report, released in 2006, states that the major collectors remain active.  Israeli military\nofficers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in the U.S. (See the Government\u2019s\nRequest for Administrative Notice).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\n\n5\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently maintained an Israeli passport.  The first disqualifying condition\nunder Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there was an \"exercise of any right . . . of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . . .  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of\na current foreign passport; . . .\"  This is countered, however, by the fifth mitigating condition. \u201c[T]he\npassport has been . . . surrendered to the cognizant security authority . . .\u201d\nThe Applicant's parents, and sisters are citizens of and reside in Israel.  The first and second\ndisqualifying conditions are arguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates \u201ca potential conflict of\ninterests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d  Under the facts of\nthis particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first and second mitigating\nconditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Israeli relatives is \u201csuch that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of . .\n. [his family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation\nunder the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines B and C are found for the\nApplicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nalleged Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\n\n6\nconditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Preference\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Foreign Influence\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

On November 24, 2005, he submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 15, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \nJune 30, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 8, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on April 22, \n2008, and issued a Notice of Hearing the same day. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on May 14, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9, which \nwere received into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A and B that were admitted into the record without objection.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 27, 2008.  \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nJordan. (Tr. 19-20). The request and the attached documents are included in the record \nas Administrative Hearing Exhibits (Exh.) I through VII. Applicant did not object to \nconsideration of those Exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively noticed are limited to \nmatters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 8, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.b and 2.c of the SOR, and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 2.d, 3.a and \n3.b, and provided additional explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and through review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He was born in Jordan and attended grammar and high \nschool there. He came to the United States in August 1977 on a student visa to attend \ncollege. In July 1980, he married his first wife, a U.S. citizen. He graduated in the spring \nof 1982 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and returned to Jordan in \nJanuary 1983 without his wife. In May 1983, he and his first wife were divorced.  Upon \nreturning to Jordan, the government drafted him into its army where he served from \nJanuary 1983 to January 1985. He worked as an electrical engineer and sometimes \nserved as a liaison to U.S. citizens assigned to work in Jordan. (Tr. 64). After \ncompleting the required two years of conscription, he received an honorable discharge \nand returned to the United States. In 1985, he married his current wife, who was born in \nLebanon and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 1983. They have five children, \nall born in the United States. In February 1990, he became a U.S. citizen. \n \n \nAfter moving back to the United States in 1985, Applicant worked for various \nprivate corporations and defense contractors. In May 2003, he began an engineering \nposition with a federal contractor and completed a SF-86 in November 2004. (GE 1). \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nAbout a year later, in October 2005, he changed jobs and started working as a senior \nengineer for his current employer, a defense contractor. In that position he supervises \nabout ten people. (Tr. 35). He completed a second security clearance application (e-\nQIP) in November 2005. (GE 5). \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Palestine, but later became resident \ncitizens of Jordan. His father died in February 2000 in Jordan. He was a tailor and \nowned his own business in Jordan. (Tr. 70). His mother subsequently became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen and resident in September 2000. She died in December 2007 \nwhile visiting Jordan. Neither parent worked for the Jordanian government. (Tr. 71).  \n \n \nApplicant is one of five children, all born in Jordan. One of his two sisters is \ndeceased and the other sister is a naturalized U.S. citizen, residing in the United States. \nOne of his brothers is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resides in the United States. His \nother brother is a resident citizen of Jordan and works as a private physician in a \ngovernment hospital. (Tr. 72) For the last 20 years, Applicant spoke to his brother once \nor twice a year. (Tr. 74). He spoke to him more frequently before his sister died in July \n2003. After his mother became ill while visiting Jordan in late 2007, he also had more \ncontact with him. (Tr. 75). Since her death in December 2007, he has communicated \nwith him about estate matters. (Tr. 76). Other than his brother, he does not have contact \nwith anyone else in Jordan. (Tr. 86).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were born in Palestine. His mother-in-\nlaw is deceased and his father-in-law is a naturalized U.S. citizen, residing in the United \nStates.  \n \n \n Applicant is an heir to his parents\u2019 estate, along with three siblings. The estate \ncontains a piece of commercial real estate from his father\u2019s business, estimated to be \nworth $500,000. (Tr. 79). He does not know when the probate of the estate will be \ncompleted, and is not responsible for taxes or expenses related to the building. (Tr. 79). \nHe spoke to his brother, residing in Jordan, about the possibility of selling his interest in \nthe estate to that brother for $20,000. He does not want his inheritance or ownership of \nthe property to affect his employment. He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want \u2013 if there\u2019s anything that \nis affecting my life outside the United States, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. . \n. . This is my life here. I don\u2019t need it basically, so I\u2019m going to let it go.\u201d (Tr. 77). He \ndoes not own any other property or assets in Jordan. (Tr. 83, 84).  He owns a home in \nthe United States, worth about $150,000. He never voted in a Jordanian election since \nobtaining his U.S. citizenship. He votes in the United States and recently voted in the \nprimary. (Tr. 60). \n \n \n \nApplicant had a Jordanian passport that was issued in April 1985 and expired in \nApril 1990. He renewed it in January 1990, one month before becoming a U.S. citizen, \nand it expired in January 1995. He renewed the Jordanian passport again in September \n1999, although he was a U.S. citizen. Around the time of the renewal, he and his family \nwere in Jordan and decided to travel to a nearby country. He learned that \u201cbecause we \nwere traveling on U.S. passports, we would have all been charged a fee to re-enter \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nJordan.\u201d [Sic]. (GE 6 at 5).  After paying the $350 fee, he was informed by the Jordanian \nofficials that it would be less costly for him and his family to travel on one Jordanian \nfamily passport. He subsequently renewed the passport. He did not know that holding a \nforeign passport could jeopardize his employment. (Tr. 58-59). That passport expired in \nSeptember 2004 and he no longer possesses it. (GE 6 at 6).  \n \n \nApplicant received his first U.S. passport in May 1990 and it expired in May 2000. \n(GE 6 at 16).  His current U.S. passport was issued in May 2000 and it expires in May \n2010. (GE 6).   \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Jordan several times after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1990. \nHe used his U.S. passport for the trips he made in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1999, and \n2003. He used his Jordanian passport in February 2000 to attend his father\u2019s funeral. \n(Answer). He did not use his U.S. passport because of the emergency nature of the trip, \nand he had checked a U.S. Government internet website advising travelers not to use a \nU.S. passport within nine months of its expiration date. (His passport was due to expire \nin May 2000). (Answer; Tr. 41-43).   \n \n \nIn an October 2007 interview, Applicant stated that \u201cI do not intend to renew my \nJordanian Passport or obtain a new one. I do not intend to obtain any non-U.S. \npassport. I do not intend to use any Jordanian identification cards or travel documents. I \nintend to only use my U.S. passport and/or U.S. identification on all future trips.\u201d (GE 6 \nat 9). \n \n \nIn November 2004, Applicant submitted a SF 86, and in November 2005, he \ncompleted an e-QIP. In both applications, he disclosed that he had a Jordanian \npassport, issued in September 1999 and expired in September 2004. He also disclosed \nhis previous trips to Jordan, including a trip home for his father\u2019s funeral in 2000. After \nsubmitting his first application, he met with an investigator in June 2005 for an interview. \n\u201dAt the time, I mentioned that I took a visit to Jordan in 2000 as I took the passports with \nme to the interview. I don\u2019t recall if the SA asked for them and/or made a copy of my \nforeign passports or not. I was trying not to hide or give any false information about all \nmy visits to Jordan.\u201d1 (Answer at 4). DOHA subsequently sent him a set of \nInterrogatories that he answered in January 2007, and another set of Interrogatories \nthat he answered in February 2007. (GE 3 and 4).  \n \n \nThe January 2008 SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his responses to one \nquestion on the January 2007 Interrogatory and one question on the February 2007 \nInterrogatory. Both questions pertain to his possession and use of a Jordanian passport.  \nApplicant denied that he intentionally falsified information on either document. (Answer). \n \n                                            \n1 Applicant brought three Jordanian passports to the security clearance interview in June 2005. \nThey were issued in April 1985, January 1990 and September 1999. Copies of those documents are \nincluded in the record and marked as GE 6, GE 7 and GE 8, respectively. The passport issued in \nSeptember 1999 contains a stamp, dated February 20, 2000, indicating that he traveled to Jordan on it at \nthat time. (GE 8). \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleged that Applicant falsified his answer to Question 4 on the \nJanuary 2007 Interrogatory that asked, \u201cDo you currently have a passport from another \ncountry other than the United States?\u201d In response, Applicant stated, \u201cHaven\u2019t used \npassport since 7/2/90. Been using U.S.A. passport since I became a citizen.\u201d That \nanswer was incorrect because he used his Jordanian passport once in 2000 after \nreceiving U.S. citizenship. In his Answer, Applicant admitted that he answered \nincorrectly. In the October 2007 interview, he stated that he had forgotten that he used \nthe passport for his 2000 trip. (GE 6 at 8).  While testifying, he explained he misread the \nquestions and was confused by the sequencing. (Tr. 98-104). He asserted that he made \nan honest mistake. (Tr. 107).   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleged that Applicant falsified his answer to Question 1 on the \nFebruary 2007 Interrogatory that asked: \u201c1. On your security clearance questionnaire \ndated 11/4/04, you indicated that you were issued a Jordanian passport on/about \n9/13/99 which was to expire on about 9/13/04. Likewise, you indicated that you obtained \nthis passport in order to visit Jordan (you subsequently traveled to Jordan in February \n2000 for your father\u2019s funeral). In your interrogatory response dated 1/10/07, you denied \npossessing a foreign passport since your naturalization on 7/2/90.\u201d \n \n \n Applicant interpreted said question to inquire whether he used his Jordanian \npassport for any trips, other than the 2000 trip, and he essentially answered no.  Based \non my reading of the question and Applicant\u2019s explanation, he answered it correctly.  \nThis allegation is found in his favor. \n \n \nIn response to the falsification allegations, Applicant denied that he intentionally \nfalsified information to the Government. He said: \n \n\u201cthere was may some honest mistakes here and there, and I have no \nintention whatsoever to hide anything from my past, because there\u2019s \nnothing in my past, that, you know, I should hide . . . So for these issues \nthat were brought up, it\u2019s either maybe the way that I explained myself. \nMaybe I didn\u2019t do a good job there. I need to watch myself, more details, \nand absolutely possibility there\u2019s nothing that I\u2019m trying to hide or lie.\u201d [Sic] \n(Tr. 108). \n \n \nApplicant credibly asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship. \u201cExcept for that I was \nborn and raised in Jordan and I decided by choice to live in the USA, I believe that\u2019s a \ngood indication that I don\u2019t want to live in Jordan. You know, I want to associate myself \nhere, you know. My kids are born here. This is our country. This is it for us, you know.\u201d \n[Sic]. (Tr. 61).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation from his colleagues, who \nhave known him for the past two years.  All of them comment favorably on his \nprofessionalism and integrity. One of Applicant\u2019s co-workers stated that he has found \nApplicant \u201cto be very professional in his communications as a team leader. His ethical \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nstandards and integrity was reflected in his objectives and the principle he set for \nhimself and his peers.\u201d  (AE B at 5).  \n \nJordan \n \nJordan is a small, Middle Eastern country governed by a constitutional monarchy. \nJordan has a pro-Western foreign policy, and has had close relations with the United \nStates for more than forty years. Torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, denial of \ndue process, and restrictions on freedom of speech are Jordanian human rights \nproblems. Despite aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of \nterrorism in Jordan remains high.  Terrorists in Jordan target U.S. interests to exploit \nand undermine U.S. national security interests. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as state intelligence services.     \n \nPOLICIES \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nANALYSIS \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the Government\u2019s security concern about foreign preference: \n When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10, two conditions could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;  \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; and \n* * * \n (d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \nWhen Applicant renewed his Jordanian passport in September 1999, after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 1990, he met the conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(d). He \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nalso served two years in the Jordanian army, raising another disqualification under AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(2). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating \ncondition. AG \u00b6 11 lists two conditions that mitigate the security concern: AG \u00b6 11(e) \n\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated;\u201d and, AG \u00b6 11(c) \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations \nof foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor. The Jordanian passport, which was issued in September 1999, \nexpired in September 2004 and is no longer valid. Applicant was not a U.S. citizen when \nhe was conscripted into the Jordanian army in 1983. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the Government\u2019s concern about foreign \ninfluence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\u201d2  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n                                            \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject \nthe individual to heightened risk or foreign influence or exploitation. \n  \n  \nApplicant has some telephonic contact with his brother, who is a resident citizen \nof Jordan and employed by a Jordanian-government owned hospital. Jordan is a pro-\nWestern country, ruled by a constitutional monarchy. It has had a close relationship with \nthe United States for more than 40 years. Nonetheless, it also continues to have human \nrights issues and has been victimized by terrorist attacks. This fact creates a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion, and a \npotential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n  \nRecently, Applicant and his three siblings became heirs to their parents\u2019 estate, \nworth approximately $500,000. His potential interest is $125,000, a substantial amount \nof money.  That interest triggers the application of AG\u00b6 7(e).  \n \n  \nFour Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to the disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a civilian physician working for a government-owned \nhospital. In that position, it is improbable that the brother would have any interest in \nacquiring protected information. Only his physical presence in Jordan creates a \n\n \n \n \n \n10\npotential that the brother\u2019s interest could be threatened to the point that Applicant would \nconfront a choice between the brother\u2019s interests and those of the United States. Based \non Jordan\u2019s long-term friendship with the United States and Applicant\u2019s historic distant \nrelationship with his brother, I find it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of the Jordanian government and those of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6 8(a) has some application.  \n \nApplicant produced substantial evidence establishing the application of AG \u00b6 \n8(b). Based on his strong connections and feelings for the United States, he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. He has lived in \nthe United States as a naturalized citizen since 1990. Prior to that time he attended \ncollege here for six years and earned his degree, before he returned to Jordan for two \nyears. His family, including his wife and two siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens, \nresiding in the United States. He has five children who were born in the United States. \nHis father-in-law is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resides here. He owns a home in the \nUnited States. He has worked in the United States since 1985 and currently has a very \ngood job. There is no evidence that he has connections or contact with any people in \nJordan other than his brother.   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(c) has very limited application because Applicant\u2019s communication with \nhis brother appears to have increased in frequency since his mother\u2019s illness and death, \nand the estate matters have arisen. Prior to the time his mother\u2019s illness in December \n2007, he spoke to his brother once or twice a year.  \n \nApplicant asserted that he is prepared to sell his share of his estate to his brother \nin Jordan for $20,000, because he does not want to jeopardize his employment here. \nGiven that he is willing to forego a large share of his inheritance, it is unlikely that his \ninterest in the property could be used to influence or pressure him. AG \u00b6 8(f) has some \napplication. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to personal conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15:       \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOne Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly relevant and \npotentially disqualifying in this case. Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \n\n \n \n \n \n11\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities\u201d may raise a security concern. Applicant incorrectly answered one \nquestion on the January 2007 Interrogatories. He denied that he intentionally falsified \nhis answers or attempted to deceive the Government.  \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the Government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in \nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant falsified the January 2007 Interrogatory \nbecause he did not disclose the information about using his Jordanian passport in 2000 \nto attend his father\u2019s funeral. Applicant admitted the omission and acknowledged his \nmistake in his Answer to the SOR. During his testimony, he emphasized his confusion \nover the wording of the questions, and thought he was answering correctly. After \nlistening to him and observing his demeanor, I believe that he may not have recalled the \n2000 trip initially and became very anxious and confused by the substance and \nsequencing of the questions.  \n \nPrior to the January 2007 Interrogatories, Applicant truthfully disclosed the \npossession of the Jordanian passport and his 2000 trip on both security applications. He  \nbrought three Jordanian passports to his 2005 interview with the government \ninvestigator, in order to disclose all information about his travel to Jordan. The passport \nissued in September 1999 documented the 2000 trip to Jordan.  Applicant disclosed this \ninformation before being confronted by the Government and early in the investigative \nprocess. Those forthright disclosures, along with the fact that English is not his native \nlanguage and his repeated assertions that he did not intend to falsify any documents, \nlead me to conclude that the omission on the 2007 interrogatories was negligent, but \nnot intentional. The Government could have not have been able to formulate the \ninterrogatory questions, but for Applicant\u2019s production of the passport in June 2005. \nHence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification. Accordingly, Guideline E \nis found in his favor and a discussion of mitigating conditions is not warranted. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors (APF) listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): They are as follows:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, \nrehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this \nadjudication.3 Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who came to the United States to further his \neducation in 1977. He returned to Jordan in 1983 and was involuntarily conscripted into \nits army. Since 1985, he has lived in the United States, and has been a naturalized \ncitizen for more than 17 years. He earned his degree at a U.S. university. He has \nworked in the United States since 1985 and established a successful career. His \nspouse is a naturalized citizen, residing with him in the U.S.  His five children were born \nin the United States. He has a strong sense of patriotism toward the United States. His \nties to the United States are much stronger than his ties to one brother living in Jordan \nwith whom he communicates infrequently. His Jordanian passport expired four years \nago and he has no intention of renewing it. There is no evidence he has ever taken any \naction that could cause potential harm to the United States. His co-workers assess him \nas loyal and honest.  \n \n Five circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First, \nthere is a significant risk of terrorism and various human rights abuses in Jordan. More \nimportantly for security purposes, terrorists are hostile to the United States and actively \nseek classified information. Terrorists, and even friendly governments, could attempt to \nuse Applicant\u2019s brother to obtain such information. Second, he had numerous \nconnections to Jordan before he permanently immigrated to the United States in 1985. \n                                            \n3 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the \neighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. \nBd.

She had\nthirteen alleged debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR) totaling approximately $10,682. She\nhas paid all but three of the debts since 2006. Her debt problems resulted from separation, divorce,\nand a period of unemployment. For the last two years she has shown her financial responsibility by\nnot generating any new delinquent debt. Applicant has mitigated security concerns arising under\nfinancial considerations. Clearance is granted. \n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 18, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On December 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\n\nApplicant received a Notice of Hearing  on April 23, 2007. At the hearing, she waived her official notice of\n1\nfifteen days.\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated January 6, 2007.\n2\n GE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated January 18, 2006) at 1-44.\n3\nId. at 62.\n4\nTr. 53.\n5\n4\nSOR on January 5, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on February 1, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for May 10, 2007.  \n1\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on May 10, 2007 to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Four\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-4) were admitted without objection.  Applicant's thirteen exhibits (AE\nA-M) were admitted into the record without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant and\nthree witnesses: a senior supervisor at the company where Applicant works; her facility security\nofficer, and her mother, as reflected in the hearing transcript (Tr.) received on May 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.l in the SOR under \u00b6 1.These admissions\nare incorporated herein. She denied allegations 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k and 1.m because she\npaid seven of these debts.  In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the evidence and\n2\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old office administrator working for a defense contractor. Her first\nmarriage, from 1995 until 2005, ended in divorce. She is remarried, and has two children from her\nfirst marriage.  Applicant earned a high school diploma in 1992. She has completed several college\n3\ncourses with the expectation of completing an undergraduate degree.  She has been employed with\n4\nher current employer since January 2006.\nEarly in her first marriage, Applicant experienced difficulties with her husband controlling\nthe finances. She and her husband had a large house, a boat, and two cars. They did not live within\ntheir means. Her husband controlled the money and encouraged their lifestyle. At times, he was\nverbally and mentally abusive to Applicant. 5\nApplicant's husband lost his job along with his high income in April 2002. He did not want\nto continue in his occupational field, but rather he wished to pursue acting. Applicant worked during\nthe marriage; however, her income was much lower than his. They had two children to support.\nConsequently, when her husband became unemployed due to a company closure, the family income\nwas reduced greatly. The family of four now had to live on a smaller income. As a result, in 2002\nfinances became a problem. They moved into a smaller home, but they were still in an untenable\n\nTr. 54-55.\n6\n GE 4 (Bankruptcy Court Records, Voluntary Petition filed August 1, 2002) at 1-37.\n7\n Id.\n8\n5\nfinancial situation. Applicant and her husband, continued to experience marital difficulties and they\nseparated.  \n6\nAt first, they tried to deal with their creditors. In 2002, however, finances became an\noverwhelming problem. They filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in August 2002.  A credit card debt\n7\nwas not discharged in bankruptcy. This account was in Applicant's name and she was left with the\ndebt.   Applicant moved out of the family home into a rental unit with her two sons.

He threatened Applicant if she\npursued any court action to obtain child support.  They were divorced in 2005.\n9\n10\nIn November 2004, Applicant could not make payments on her bills. She attempted to\nreconcile with her husband, but that did not work. Applicant quit her job at that point and moved so\nthat she and her children could live in her mother's home. She felt that she and her boys needed to\nlive a distance away from her husband for safety.  She was successful in finding employment after\n11\ntwo months. However, she then became unemployed for about nine months. She received\nunemployment during that time. Simultaneously, she contacted her creditors to initiate payments on\nthe debts.  Some creditors would not settle and instead placed judgments against her.\n12\nIn 2006, when Applicant received her full time employment, she obtained her credit report.\nWith the help of her second husband she put together a plan and a realistic budget so she could\npursue debt repayment. Applicant had medical bills from a dentist and other physician visits. Her\nhusband's insurance sent payment directly to her husband and not to the service provider. The\nmedical bills were overwhelming from  numerous hospitalizations, doctor visits, prescriptions, and\ncopays.13\nApplicant paid seven debts alleged in the SOR.  She has improved her credit score. She\n14\ncurrently has only three outstanding debts. A group of small medical bills (24) totals $2,648; a credit\ncard account ($2,300) that was not included in the 2002 bankruptcy, and a loan in the amount of\n$1,286.\nApplicant has contacted the credit card company several times by telephone. Since the\naccount was closed and charged off, she had to find the collection agent for the account. She spoke\nto the credit card company's legal department and ultimately obtained the proper contact. When she\ncontacted them, she affirmed her desire to pay the account or settle it. She is in the process of setting\nup a payment plan. Each month Applicant pays $75 on the medical accounts. She is trying to settle\nthe loan amount with the new collection company. Initially, they did not accept the amount Applicant\ncould pay on the account. She is waiting for more information.15\nApplicant is highly recommended by her employer for a security clearance. She is rated as\nan outstanding administrator who is diligent, reputable and very reliable. She has the full support of\nher direct supervisor, who describes her skills as exceeding his initial expectations for the job\n\nTestimony of Witness at Tr. 19-20.\n16\nId.\n17\nTestimony of Witness at Tr. 20-22.\n18\nTestimony of Witness at Tr. 32.\n19\nTr. 103.\n20\nId.\n21\n7\nposition in every manner.  Due to her exceptional work performance she was promoted within the\n16\nfirst six months of her employment. This promotion provided a percentage salary increase. Her two\nyears of employment are unblemished.  She received another performance bonus for 2006. She is\n17\na trusted agent in an environment where security is a concern.  She has excellent potential and\n18\nopportunity for advancement in the defense industry.   \n19\nApplicant earns approximately $1,760 net a month.  Her current husband earns $1,900 net\n20\na month. Today, Applicant lives within her means, and has not acquired any significant debt other\nthan her home mortgage.  She is current on her mortgage and her car loan. She is financially stable.\n21\nShe accepts responsibility for paying her debts, despite the fact that she inherited some of them due\nto events beyond her control. Her bills are paid on time.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n22\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n23\n Department of the Navy v.

The government\n22\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n23\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n24\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n25\ndecision.26\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n27\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n28\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n29\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n30\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised AG most pertinent to the evaluation\nof the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.31\n\n9\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued thirteen\ndelinquent debts. She currently has three debts that are still outstanding. She and her husband filed\nfor Bankruptcy in 2002.  Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC),\nAG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC, AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Several incidents occurred\nin Applicant' s life over which she had no control. Her first husband's control over money in their\nmarriage, her separation and divorce, and loss of her income and her periods of unemployment are\nnot in dispute. Such incidents contributed to Applicant's acquisition of delinquent debt. She never\nquestioned the legitimacy of the debts. She paid what debts she could and researched all the options.\nTherefore, FC MC , AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies. \nApplicant's thirteen debts became delinquent in a short period of time. After the bankruptcy,\nApplicant separated and eventually divorced her husband. She had no help from her husband with\nchild support. She had to move from the family home and became unemployed shortly thereafter. Her\ngoal to support her sons and provide for their needs is firm. She has managed to not incur other\ndelinquencies despite some medical problems. Her credit rating is steadily improving. She has a\nposition with a good income and chance for advancement. She was open and honest during her\nsecurity application process.  Therefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC), AG\n\u00b6 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.\nAlthough Applicant has not received counseling, she never ignored her creditors. She paid\nseven debts and is paying on the remaining three debts. Of that remaining three, the amount of debt\nis not sufficient to generate a security risk. FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) does apply to some extent.\nIn the past years, Applicant's resolve was to pay all her current bills and concentrate scarce\nresources toward necessities and honor her immediate creditors. She moved from her family home\nand sought employment.  Her unemployment period hampered her efforts to pay all her bills. She did\nnot have sufficient income to make lump payment sum payments. Some settlement offers she received\nwere not within her reach. Therefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies to a degree.\nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her\noutstanding debts, but whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security clearance decision. Her remaining unpaid debt\ndoes not constitute a security risk. In 2006, she began repayment of her delinquent debt. She has a\nprofessional position with a good income and stands ready to proceed with her remaining payment\nplan.\n\n10\nWhole Person Analysis\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. She\nis an earnest, mature woman currently in a professional position in the defense contractor industry.\nShe did her best to seek financial solutions that would work for her in the long term. Her testimony\nat the hearing was candid and straightforward. At the hearing she acknowledged the life style that she\nand her husband had. However, the 2002 bankruptcy was a legitimate method of dealing with the\nfinancial delinquencies. She is open, honest and has not hidden the situation. Her separation and\ndivorce exacerbated financial issues. She firmly believes she is handling her debt properly. Her\nmethod of paying the remaining debt is a reasonable way to resolve the debts. She has not incurred\nany other delinquent debt in two years. Her financial circumstances have improved. The potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low. She is current on his financial obligations, and has\na very positive employment history since 2005. A greater awareness of financial responsibilities will\nresult in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is low. Applicant's financial case shows her\nwillingness to utilize her repayment plan to resolve her delinquent debts. However, three SOR debts\nremain. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated the security concerns\npertaining to financial considerations. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant is a 57 year old employee of a defense contractor. He received an Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Navy after serving on active duty for over 20 years. In June 2004, applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In December 2004, he received a Discharge from the bankruptcy court. Applicant was indebted to Citi Auto in the approximate amount of $5,971.00. The debt was charged off by the creditor in September 2003. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated the debt was discharged by the bankruptcy court. This debt does not appear on the two most recent credit reports offered by the Government (Exhibits 7 and 8). I find that this debt was discharged by the bankruptcy court. Applicant was indebted to Ford Motor Credit in the approximate amount of $4,179.00 as a result of a judgment it obtained against applicant in 2001. Although this judgment is listed on all three credit reports offered by the Government, I find applicant\u2019s statement, that this debt was discharged by the bankruptcy court, to be credible and worthy of belief. In his response to the SOR, applicant made the following statements: Since our bankruptcy we have had no outstanding debts . . . we don\u2019t have any credit cards and we pay cash for our purchases.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties, which resulted in a bankruptcy filing and discharge,\noccurred over two years ago. He is committed to avoiding a recurrence of these problems. Clearance\nis granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 6 and February 20, 2007, and elected\nto have his case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government's written case (FORM) on or about March 7, 2007. Applicant did not file a response\nto the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 57 year old employee of a defense contractor. He received an Honorable\nDischarge from the U.S. Navy after serving on active duty for over 20 years.\nIn June 2004, applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In December 2004, he received\na Discharge from the bankruptcy court.\nApplicant was indebted to Citi Auto in the approximate amount of $5,971.00. The debt was\ncharged off by the creditor in September 2003.  In his response to the SOR, applicant stated the debt\nwas discharged by the bankruptcy court. This debt does not appear on the two most recent credit\nreports offered by the Government (Exhibits 7 and 8). I find that this debt was discharged by the\nbankruptcy court.\nApplicant was indebted to Ford Motor Credit in the approximate amount of $4,179.00 as a\nresult of a judgment it obtained against applicant in 2001. Although this judgment is listed on all\nthree credit reports offered by the Government, I find applicant\u2019s statement, that this debt was\ndischarged by the bankruptcy court, to be credible and worthy of belief.\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant made the following statements:\nSince our bankruptcy we have had no outstanding debts . . . we don\u2019t have any credit\ncards and we pay cash for our purchases. We are living within our means and have\nno plans to do otherwise. Our bills include one vehicle payment, rent, insurance, and\nutilities, and one book club . . . We have only declared bankruptcy once and have\nsince stayed out of debt.\nI would like to add that we live modestly and simply without extra extravagances.\nWe are happy this way and have no intention of changing our lifestyle. We have no\noutstanding debts, just normal living expenses, and we like it that way.\n\nPages 18-19.\n1\n3\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant has a history of not honoring his financial obligations.\nDisqualifying Conditions 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and 19(c)  (a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations) are applicable.\nOnce the Government established a prima facie case under Guideline F, the burden shifted\nto applicant to show he has reformed. Applicant  met his burden.  He offered credible evidence that\nthe two debts listed in the SOR were discharged by the bankruptcy court, and that he has not been\ndelinquent on any new debts since receiving his discharge over two years ago. His statements in\nresponse to the SOR indicate he is committed to avoiding future financial problems.\nBased on the foregoing, and after consideration of the factors set forth in Enclosure 2,\nParagraph 2 of the Directive,  Guideline F is found for applicant.\n1\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: FOR THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nSeptember 17, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings are\nbased upon substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.   \n1\nThe Judge found that Applicant had unpaid debts, including two federal income tax liens of\n$68,588.55 and $18,951.24 respectively.  He also had a charged off \u201cbank account debt\u201d for $110.\nApplicant denied knowledge of this debt and had taken no action \u201c to inquire or dispute\u201d it.  Decision\nat 4.  Another debt, to a car rental agency, was in dispute at the time of the decision.  In 1987,\nApplicant was discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He continued to incur debt, however, and filed\nagain for bankruptcy protection, under Chapter 13, in 1991.  He was discharged in 1998.  Regarding\nthe tax liens, Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for many years between 1980 and\n2005.  Additionally, when asked on his security clearance application (SCA) if he had debts that had\nbeen delinquent over 90 days and over 180 days respectively, he answered \u201cno,\u201d despite these tax\nliens and the bank debt.\nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision and conclude that his findings are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant knowingly provided false\ninformation on his SCA is sustainable.   The Judge weighed the evidence supplied by Applicant and\n2\nconsidered the application of relevant mitigating conditions, finding in Applicant\u2019s favor on some\nof the Guideline F security concerns, including those pertaining to his bankruptcy proceedings.  \n3\nNevertheless, the record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to meet his burden\nof persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for him to have a\n\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption\n4\nagainst the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990),\nth\ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts\nto the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance\nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n3\nsecurity clearance.

The Internal Revenue Service placed a tax lien against\nApplicant that has yet to be satisfied.  He has now filed income tax returns and is working to resolve\nhis tax indebtedness.  He deliberately did not respond correctly on his security clearance application\nto the questions concerning liens, and debts more than 180 days or 90 days past due.  Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive).  The new adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective in the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006, will be used to adjudicate\nthis case.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 12, 2007.  The SOR alleges\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct),\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines and the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 1, 2007.  He admitted five and denied six\nof the allegations under Guideline F with an explanation.  He denied all of the allegations under\nGuidelines E and J.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge, and the request was\nreceived by DOHA on March 5, 2007.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case\non March 25, 2007.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on March 28, 2007.  A\nhearing was conducted on June 6, 2007, and Applicant was granted a continuance to consult with an\nattorney.  The case was reassigned to me on June 21, 2007.  Applicant\u2019s attorney was unable to\nproceed with the case until late August 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 24, 2007 for\na hearing on August 22, 2007.  The hearing convened as scheduled.  Fifteen government exhibits,\nmarked Government Exhibits 1-15 were introduced.  Applicant objected to the admission of\nGovernment Exhibits 8, 9, 10, and 15 which were not admitted.  Government Exhibits 5, 11, and 14\nwere admitted for limited purposes.  Nine Applicant exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits A-I, were\nadmitted without objection.  The record was held open for Applicant to admit additional exhibits.\nTwo additional Applicant Exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits J-K, were timely received and\nadmitted without objection.  The testimony of the Applicant and three Applicant witnesses were\nreceived during the hearing.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nessential findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 71-year-old college graduate senior electronics engineer anticipating working\nwith a defense contractor.  He commenced working in the defense industry in 1963 and he has held\na security clearance since then.  He worked in the defense industry on missiles, winged bombs, and\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated April 27, 2004).\n1\nApplicant Exhibit B (Divorce Decree and Agreement, dated January 9, 1985).\n2\nTr. 56-63, 79-82.\n3\nGovernment Exhibit 2 (Credit report, dated January 13, 2007); Government Exhibit 3 (Credit report, dated\n4\nOctober 28, 2005); Government Exhibit 4 (Credit report, dated May 21, 2004); Government Exhibit 5 (Credit report,\ndated July 23, 1993).

He worked for various defense contractors on\ndifferent products until the contracts were completed.  He worked for 17 years, from 1979 to 1994,\nfor one contractor until he received a lucrative buy-out proposal when that company\u2019s project for the\ngovernment was completed.  Since then he has been an independent consultant working for defense\ncontractors.  He is presently not working for a contractor but a defense contractor anticipates\nemploying him for a contract.  He submitted a security clearance application for the ten year periodic\nupdate of his clearance in 2004 in anticipation of the employment.   Applicant is married for the\n1\nsecond time.  His first marriage lasted for 30 years from 1955 to 1985.  The marriage was terminated\nin a contested divorce.  Applicant was required to pay alimony and child support.   He remarried in\n2\n1991, and has been married for over 16 years.  He and his present wife have custody of his two young\ngrandchildren, and anticipate adopting them shortly.  \n3\nA security investigation triggered by Applicant\u2019s security clearance application reveals\nsecurity concerns based on credit reports.   The first security concern is a delinquent debt, denied by\n4\nApplicant, to a car rental agency for damage to a rental car.  Applicant contested this debt.  When\nApplicant returned the car, he paid the bill. Subsequently, he was notified by the car rental agency\nof a debt for damage to the car.  He informed the rental agency that his credit card company was\nobligated to pay for any damage.  He notified the credit card company which made inquiries of the\nrental agency.  The credit card company never received a response from the rental car agency and the\ndebt is still under dispute.5\nThe next security concerns are delinquent debts for medical bills from a medical center\nrelating to Applicant\u2019s cataract surgery.  Applicant stated these were not valid debts since he paid the\nmedical bills.  The creditor acknowledged that the bills were paid in full.6\nThere are security concerns for tax liens of $68,588.55, and $18,951.24, filed by the Internal\nRevenue Service in 2000 and 2004.   Applicant acknowledged the tax liens.\n7\nThere is a security concern alleged for a wage garnishment of $253 weekly for unpaid child\nsupport.  Applicant acknowledged that his wages were garnished for child support, but not because\nthe child support payments were in arrears.  His wages were garnished by the court as a means of\n\nTr. 68-69, 86-89; Applicant Exhibit I (Letter, dated August 22, 2007).\n8\nTr. 68, 86.\n9\nTr. 69-70, 98-100; Government Exhibit 12 (Chapter 13 Petition, dated March 25, 1991); Government Exhibits\n10\n13 and 14 (Employer\u2019s notice of wage plan withholding, dated October 6, 1986); Applicant Exhibit D (Bankruptcy\ndocuments, dated January 22, 1991, and July 6, 2007).\nTr. 70-72; See, Government Exhibits 6 and 7 (Notices of Federal Tax Liens).\n11\nApplicant Exhibit J (Federal tax returns for 1997-2002).\n12\nApplicant Exhibit G (IRS Account Transcripts, dated August 17, 2007).\n13\nApplicant Exhibit A (Letter, dated June 6, 2007).\n14\nTr. 73-74, 90-92.\n15\n4\npaying the child support payments.  Applicant settled his child support obligations with his former\nwife.  His former wife, who raised the children supported by the payments, acknowledged Applicant\nhas paid all child support and does not owe any child support payments.8\nThere is a security concern for a charged off bank account debt for $110.  Applicant has no\nknowledge of this debt.  He has not taken any action to inquire or dispute the debt.9\nThere is a security concern for Applicant\u2019s  filing for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy after his\ndivorce from his former wife.  His child support and alimony payments were calculated on a higher\nincome than he received, so he was unable to pay all of his debts.  The resulting bankruptcy was\nconverted from a Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the debts discharged on August 6, 1987.\nApplicant continued to incur debt, and again filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on April 3,1991.  He\ncompleted the wage earners plan and the bankruptcy was discharged on January 15, 1998.10\nThere is a security concern because Applicant did not file federal tax returns for many years\nfrom 1980 to 2005.  Applicant acknowledged and admitted he did not file the tax returns as required.\nHe stated that taxes were withheld from his pay but he did not file the returns.   He did file the\n11\nrequired returns in 2004.   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is in the process of auditing the\n12\nreturns he filed to determine his tax liability.   He has consulted a tax consulting company to assist\n13\nhim with his tax returns.   \n14\nApplicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to question 36 on his security clearance application asking if in the\nlast seven years any liens were placed against his property for failing to pay taxes.  Applicant knew\nat the time he had tax liens placed against him.  He believed the liens were against him personally.\nHe had no property to place a tax lien.   Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to question 38 asking if in the\n15\nlast seven years he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts, and question 39 if he was\ncurrently more than 90 days past due on any debts.  Applicant knew of the tax liens but thought that\nsince the tax debt was being collected from his pay and social security, he was not past due.  He was\ncontesting the car rental debt so he thought it was not past due.  He did not know of the medical or\n\nTr. 74-77, 92-93.\n16\nAppellant Exhibit E (Performance ratings, July 1979 to December 1990).\n17\nApplicant Exhibit F (Message, date August 22, 2007).\n18\nApplicant Exhibit H (Message, date August 22, 2007).\n19\nEven though this was not introduced as an exhibit by Applicant, I considered it since it was contained in the\n20\nfile given me from the hearing conducted on June 6, 2007.\nTr. 105-111.\n21\nTr. 111-116.\n22\nTr. 116-123.\n23\n5\nbank debts.16\nApplicant is well regarded for his work performance.  He presented his performance ratings\nfrom the defense contractor he worked for from 1979 to 1994.  His rating were uniformly superior\nwith major contributions to his projects.   Applicant presented a recommendation message from the\n17\nfacilities security officer for one of his former employers who has known Applicant for 20 years.  It\nwas her opinion Applicant was not a security risk.  Applicant has always been aware of security\nrequirements, and has been committed to security procedures.   A former supervisor wrote that he\n18\nknew Applicant for over 20 years.  He has never seen Applicant being lax or careless or ignoring\nsecurity requirements.  He noted Applicant was instrumental in reporting another employee who did\ncommit security violations and was later punished.   The file from the first hearing conducted on\n19\nJune 6, 2007, contained a message from a security officer from one of Applicant\u2019s former employers\nto one of the Department Counsel.  She noted the when Applicant worked for her company she knew\nof no reason to question Applicant\u2019s handling of classified information.20\nA witness testified he has know Applicant since 1972 when they worked together on\ngovernment missile and bomb projects.  After the witness retired from the government in 1979, they\nworked together on projects for the same employer.  The work was classified and Applicant always\ncomplied with security procedures.  He knows of Applicant\u2019s financial problems.  The issues are\nthings Applicant must fix but he does not consider him to be a security risk.   Another witness\n21\ntestified that he has know Applicant for over 20 years.  They both worked in testing of missiles and\nbomb.  He was a government representative and Applicant was a contractor employee.  They had\ndaily contact from 1980 to 1991.  He has never known Applicant to be a security risk and Applicant\nalways followed security procedures.   Another witness testified that he has know Applicant for over\n22\n25 years.  They worked together on and off in test engineering.  He never know Applicant to be a\nsecurity risk .  Applicant always followed security procedures.  He has no concern about Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity worthiness.  Applicant applied to work at his company and he would favorably support his\nemployment.23\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense\ndecision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an\naffirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative judge\nmust apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n26\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.27\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n28\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish any controverted facts in the SOR.29\nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate disqualifying\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n30\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n31\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\n\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (App. Bd.

The exhibit noted that Applicant\u2019s former employer notified him that he had improperly\nused the company credit card.  The company took no action except to advise Applicant of the correct reasons to use the\ncompany credit card.  This incident was never raised in the SOR as an allegation, and the exhibit does not indict any\ndeliberate wrong actions by Applicant to affect his security worthiness.\n7\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n32\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n33\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 34\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nUnder Guideline F, the failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individuals\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.   The government\n35\npresented information that Applicant has not settled a debt with a car rental company, has outstanding\nmedical debts, has an unsatisfied federal tax lien, a charged off bank account debt, a child support\nwage garnishment, twice filed bankruptcy, and has not filed federal tax returns for a number of years.\nThis information is sufficient to raise Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) \u00b6\n19(a) (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FI DC \u00b6 19(c) (A history of not meeting financial\nobligations); and FI DC 19(g) (Failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as\nrequired or the fraudulent filing of same).  \n36\nApplicant raised by his testimony and information a number of Financial Consideration\nMitigating Conditions (FI MC).  Applicant contested the rental car charge for damage to the vehicle\nand contacted his credit card company which should have paid the debt.  The rental car company never\nresponded to the credit card company.  Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the debt and\nprovided documented proof of action taken to resolve the issue.  He presented sufficient information\nto mitigated this security concerns under FI MC \u00b6 20(e) (The individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue).\nHowever, he has not mitigated security concerns for the charged off bank debt under this same\nmitigating condition.  He claims he does not know of the debt, but he took no action to inquire about\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n37\n8\nor resolve the debt.  He did not present evidence of a reasonable basis to dispute the debt or any action\nto resolve it.\nApplicant presented sufficient information to mitigate any security concerns for the three\nmedical debts.  Applicant\u2019s payment of the debts in full mitigates the security under FI MC \u00b6 20 (d)\n(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant presented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns raised by his filing\nof bankruptcy and wage garnishment for child support.  The debts raised in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy\narose after his divorce because of the need to pay child support and alimony.  The debts were\ndischarged in 1987.  Applicant filed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1991, completed the wage earners\npayment plan, and was discharged from the bankruptcy in April 1998.  Bankruptcy is a legal and\npermissible means to resolve debts.  The Chapter 7 bankruptcy action was over 20 years ago, and the\nChapter 13 was completed almost ten years ago.  Applicant completed all actions required of him under\nthe bankruptcies.  The conditions that required him to file bankruptcy were caused by his divorce and\nrequirement to pay large child support.  Since he completed all actions required, he acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.  He has mitigated security concerns for the bankruptcies under FI MC \u00b6 20\n(a) (The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.), and FI MC \u00b6 20 (b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances).\nApplicant presented information that his wages were garnished to pay child support.  The\ngarnishment was used by the court as a means of collecting the child support.  He never failed to pay\nthe child support and he has no debt for failure to pay child support.  Since the child support never went\nunpaid, and Applicant met his child support obligations, he mitigated any security concern for failure\nto pay child support.\nApplicant has failed to present sufficient information to mitigate his failure to file income tax\nreturns for multiple years from 1980 to 2005, and his resulting indebtedness to the IRS requiring the\nfiling of tax liens for $68,588, and $18,951.  Applicant admitted he did not file the returns as required.\nHe did file returns for the years he did not file in 2004, and engaged the services of a company to assist\nin his efforts to settle with the IRS.  However, his IRS debt is still current.  His actions were frequent\nsince he did not file returns for many years.  There is no indication that the failure to file the returns\nwould not recur.  FI MC \u00b6 20 (a) (The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s IRS tax lien debts and his\nfailure to file tax returns.\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.   The government presented information that Applicant answered\u201dNO\u201d\n37\n\nAG \u00b6 30.\n38\nTitle 26, United States Code \u00a7 7603. \n39\nTitle 18, United States Code \u00a7 1001.\n40\n9\non his security clearance application when asked if any tax liens were placed against his property, and\nanswered \u201cNO\u201d concerning debts past due over 180 days or 90 days.  Information was presented that\nindict there were tax liens against Applicant, and there were debts past due over the time limits raised\nin the questions.  This information raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a)\n(Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).  The crux of the security concern is the\ndeliberateness of the action in providing false information.\nApplicant testified that in response to the question concerning the tax liens, he knew of the liens\nbut thought the liens were against him personally and not against property since he owned no property.\nApplicant completed the security clearance application in April 2004.  The first tax lien was issued in\nSeptember 2000.  The notice from the IRS is titled, \u201cNotice of Federal Tax Lien\u201d.  There is no doubt\nApplicant knew of the tax lien.  His reading of the question that it pertained to property only is an\nunreasonable reading of the question by a college graduate.  Likewise, Applicant stated he did not\nknow he had debts past due over 180 days or 90 days.  Applicant knew he had delinquent debts from\nhis failure to pay taxes.  He thought he possibly could have other debts but he did not even make an\neffort to learn of his debts before he completed the security clearance application.  His actions in not\nlearning of the exact nature of his debts before responding to the questions on the security clearance\napplication show a deliberate action to omit relevant security matters.  I considered all of the mitigating\nconditions raised under AG \u00b6 17 and find none apply.\nUnder Guideline J, a security concern exist for criminal activity which creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.   The government presented\n38\ninformation concerning two instances of criminal conduct.  It is a misdemeanor crime under United\nStates Federal Law to fail to annually file income tax returns.   It is also a crime under United States\n39\nFederal Law to deliberately provide false or misleading information during security clearance\nproceedings.   As noted above, Applicant failed to file income tax returns for a number of years and\n40\nhe deliberately responded with a false anser to three questions on his security clearance application.\nThis information raised Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (A single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offense), and CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (Allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).  Each yearly\nfailure by Applicant to file an income tax return is a criminal offense.  His failure to file returns for a\nnumber of years are multiple lesser offenses.  However, his action to deliberately provide false answers\non his security clearance application is a serious crime.\nI considered all of the mitigating conditions under criminal conduct and find none apply.\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (So much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply\nbecause his last failure to file taxes was recent in 2002.  He provided false answers on his security\n\n10\nclearance application barely three years ago in 2004.  There were no unusual circumstances that\ntriggered either action.  CC MC 32(b) (The person was pressured or coerce into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life) does not apply because there was nothing\npressuring Applicant to act as he did in either circumstance, and both his actions were deliberate.  CC\nMC \u00b6 32(c) (Evidence that the person did not commit the offense) does not apply because the evidence\nshows that Applicant committed both offenses.  He did not file his income tax returns and he\ndeliberately provided the false answers on his security clearance application.  CC MC \u00b6 32(d) (There\nis evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement) does not apply.  As noted above, the\ncriminal activity was recent happening only a few years ago.  While Applicant has taken some steps\nto resolve his tax problems, this is not evidence of successful rehabilitation but just the realization that\nhe must pay his past due taxes.  He did not express true remorse and he is only now trying to make\nrestitution on his taxes.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions as well as the following factors in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. The\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept requires consideration of all available information about Appellant, not a\nsingle item in isolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness.  Applicant neglected an important responsibility of a citizen to file income tax returns.  He\ndid not fail once or twice, but for many years.  While there is no information to indicate that Applicant\nfailed to protect classified information in his many years of holding a security clearance, his failure to\nfile income tax returns shows an irresponsibility toward his civic and financial duties that indicates that\nhe could be irresponsible in his handling of classified information.  Also, Applicant deliberately did\nnot provide correct information on his security clearance application indicating again that he could\npossibly not follow the rules concerning protection of classified information.  Any doubt as to access\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of the national security.  Applicant\u2019s failure to file\nincome tax returns and deliberate falsifications on his security clearance application raises doubts as\nto his suitability for access to classified information.  This doubt is resolved in favor of national\nsecurity.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by\nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial\nconsiderations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn February 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,\nand Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statements, dated March 13, 2007 and April 25, 2007, Applicant responded to the\nSOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on May 10, 2007.\nThe FORM was mailed to Applicant on May 15, 2007, and received on May 22, 2007. Applicant was\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation. Applicant did not respond. The case was assigned to me on July 19, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his SOR response, Applicant admits SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g and denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c,\n1.d, and 1.e.  He does not admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a, but claims he did not know about the judgment\nthat he was alleged to have deliberately omitted on his security clearance application. I treat this\nstatement as a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough\nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old man employed with a Department of Defense contractor who is\napplying for a security clearance. He is married.  He has children but the number is unknown because\n2\nhe did not list any children on his security clearance application. He admits that his wages are being\ngarnished for child support.  \n3\n\n Item 4.\n4\n Item 5 at 1. \n5\n Item 3 at 2. \n6\n Item 5. \n7\n Item 3; Item 4, Section 27.\n8\n Id. \n9\n Item 3.\n10\n3\nOn December 21, 2005, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for investigative\nprocessing (e-QIP).   In response to Section 27(d) Your Financial Record, \"In the last 7 years, have\n4\nyou had any judgments against you that have not been paid?\", he answered, \"No.\" He did not\ndisclose that he had a judgment filed against him by a mortgage company in the amount of $2,782\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a).   In his response to the SOR, Applicant claims that his wife was the primary applicant\n5\non the account.  He was the co-applicant.  He did not know that he had a judgment filed against him\nwhen he filled out his e-QIP application.6\nA credit report, dated January 25, 2007, was obtained during Applicant's background\ninvestigation. The credit report listed six delinquent accounts consisting of the $2,782 judgment on\nbehalf of a mortgage company obtained in March 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $167 unpaid medical account\nplaced for collection in May 2003, creditor unknown (SOR \u00b6 1.b); an $86 unpaid medical account\nplaced for collection in May 2004, creditor unknown (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $221 unpaid medical account\nplaced for collection in April 2006, creditor unknown (SOR \u00b6 1.d); an $849 collection account for\na cell phone (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and a $12,339 charged off account related to a vehicle repossession in\napproximately August 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f).    \n7\n  \nApplicant's wages are being garnished $750 per month for child support.   SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges\n8\nthat Applicant has an $1,800 child support arrearage. There is nothing in the record evidence to\nsupport this assertion.  Applicant disclosed that his wages were being garnished on his e-QIP form\nand indicates in his response to the SOR that the garnishment continues.  I find for Applicant with\n9\nrespect to SOR \u00b6 1.g.  \nApplicant admits the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. and 1.f. He states that these accounts\nbecame delinquent when his wife was unemployed and they had trouble making payments on his\nincome alone. No payments have been made towards either account.  \n10\nApplicant denies the three medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.  He does not\nrecognize the accounts.  There is nothing in the file which indicates the identity of the creditors for\nthese medical accounts. I find for the Applicant regarding these three accounts since the allegation\nis not pled with sufficient specificity to allow Applicant the opportunity to respond to the allegations.\n\n Item 3. \n11\n Id. \n12\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). \n13\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 18. \n14\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 15.\n15\n4\nApplicant denies the delinquent cell phone account turned over for collection alleged in SOR\n\u00b6 1.e. He claims that he does not recognize the account.  He does not indicate that he made any\n11\nattempt to dispute his credit report or to contact the creditor in order to determine whether it is his\naccount.  \nApplicant intends to make arrangements to set up payment plans for the debts that he admits\nthat he owes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e).   At the close of the record, he provided no evidence that he took\n12\nsteps to do so.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n13\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.14\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.15\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n16\n Id.\n17\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n20\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n16\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n17\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n18\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.19\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n20\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\n\n6\nApplicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. He encountered financial problems\nover the past several years, accumulating six delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $16,444.\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's\ncase. Even though I find for the Applicant regarding three of the deliquent accounts due to the\nvagueness of the pleading, three delinquent accounts remain with an approximate total balance of\n$15,970.\nThe financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  I find that no mitigating conditions\napply.  Applicant has provided no proof of any attempts to resolve his delinquent accounts. A promise\nto pay in the future is not sufficient mitigation under the financial considerations concern. Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances) potentially could be applied.  Applicant mentioned that his wife was unemployed\nfor awhile and they had difficulty paying bills on his income alone. He did not indicate how long his\nwife was unemployed and provided no evidence of his household's current financial situation. I cannot\nconclude that Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances because he has not taken steps\nto resolve his delinquent accounts.\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central\nquestion if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard\nclassified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any\nwritten document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in\nother official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  \nApplicant is alleged to have falsified his e-QIP application, dated December 21, 2005, because\nhe did not list the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in response to section 27(d). Applicant claims he\ndid not list the judgment because he was unaware of the judgment at the time he completed the\nquestionnaire. I find Applicant had no intent to mislead the government pertaining to this judgment.\nI find his statement that he was unaware of the judgment to be credible. \n \nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the financial considerations concern. Therefore, I\nam persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

He has not made a good faith effort to resolve the debt.\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 14, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on April 10, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 1, 2007. I convened a hearing on June 26, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. The Government offered six exhibits that were marked as GE 1-6 and admitted without\nobjections. Applicant testified on his behalf and offered two exhibits that were marked as AE A-B\nand were admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 63 years old and retired from the Department of the Navy as a civilian employee\nafter 34 years service and receives a pension. He has been married for 42 years and has three grown\nsons. After he retired he and his wife moved to another state. After a period of time he decided to\nreturn to work and is employed by a federal contractor as an engineering technician. He had a top\nsecret clearance while he was employed with the Navy. It expired upon his retirement. \nApplicant has one large delinquent debt that was charged off in the amount of $37,798, in\n2001. He incurred this debt in approximately 1995, when he purchased a recreational vehicle.  He\n1\nexperienced some financial problems due to medical issues of two of his family members.

He stated he was never contacted by\n4\nthe creditor, however, he was aware that he owed them money.  \n5\nIn February 2006, when Applicant became aware the debt was affecting his ability to obtain\na security clearance he contacted the creditor and attempted to settle the debt.  He was advised by\n6\nthe creditor he owed the total $37,000. Applicant presented a letter dated March 6, 2002.  Applicant\n7\nstated he never received this letter when it was sent and only recently received a faxed copy of it. It\nwas a collection letter, detailing the vehicle was sold in 2002, and the net sale proceeds were listed\nas $19,700, and a deficiency balance that included interest and late charges was listed as $20,578.83.8\nApplicant insists he wants further accounting data from the creditor. It was unclear as to what exactly\nfurther accounting Applicant expected from the creditor, as it was detailed in the March 6, 2002\nletter. Applicant claimed he requested a \u201cmore detailed accounting\u201d of the amount owed but never\nreceived one. On April 16, 2007, he received another letter referencing his conversation with the\ncreditor and an offer to settle the debt for $18,000. Applicant did not respond to the creditor and\nwants to settle for half the amount offered.  When asked what his intentions are concerning the debt,\n9\nhe stated \u201cIgnore it until I get something that is what I feel is in the ballpark. Otherwise I\u2019m going\nto ignore it.\u201d  He went on to say \u201cI would like to resolve the debt, but I would like to do it in\n10\nsomewhat along my terms instead of their terms.\u201d  Additionally he stated: \u201c[I]f we can come to\n11\nsome sort of terms between me and [creditor] I will resolve it. What I\u2019m looking for is a 50/50\nagreement on that $18,000.\u201d  He admits that when he returned the vehicle in 2001, the balance owed\n12\nwas approximately $34,000, and with interest and penalties the balance increased.  The vehicle was\n13\nsold and there is a deficiency balance of approximately $20,000. The creditor is willing to settle for\n$18,000, but Applicant  wants more documentation from the creditor.  It is unclear exactly what he\n14\nwants the creditor to produce and what exactly he disputes about the debt. He stated he had not\n\nTr. 42.\n15\nTr. 47.\n16\nTr. 55.\n17\nDepartment of the Navy v.

He estimates\nthat after paying his monthly expenses he has approximately $1,500 remaining.  He has\n16\napproximately $25,000 in savings and owns a house that has a mortgage. He has not contacted the\ncredit agency to advise them that he disputes the debt.

An applicant \u201chas\n29\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n30\non the side of denial.\u201d31\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nFinancial Considerations is a concern because failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot\nbe explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\n\n6\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant was aware he owed a deficiency debt on a recreational\nvehicle and ignored it since 2001 because the creditor did not contact him. He has not accepted a\nsettlement offer and has not made a counter offer. Applicant will only resolve the debt on his own\nterms. Both disqualifying conditions apply.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nApplicant has one large debt that remains unpaid. He was aware for the past six years that\nhe owed at least something on the debt, but had not addressed it until his security clearance became\nan issue. Applicant\u2019s testimony reflected an uncertainty as to what he really intended to do about the\ndebt. It appears he will only pay it if it is on his terms and for the amount he wants to pay. He stated\nhe disputes the amount he owes, but fails to appreciate the debt has been delinquent for more than\nsix years and it is likely he incurred additional interest expenses from the original debt. I do find this\nsituation is unlikely to recur in the future. However, I also find that Applicant\u2019s failure to address\nit and minimally set up a repayment plan years ago does cast doubt on his judgment. I find FC MC\n20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide amplifying information beyond he had medical\ndebts to pay to show the situation was beyond his control. Even if he was confronted with financial\ndifficulties due to medical debts, he failed to ensure that he worked out some plan to repay the\nvehicle debt rather than letting it sit dormant for years. He is working full time and receives a\npension and has the means to resolve the debt. I find FC MC 20(b) does not apply. No evidence was\nprovided that Applicant received financial counseling or that there are clear indications the problem\nis being resolved. Applicant has not made a good faith effort to resolve the debt. He waited six years\nto address the debt and then will only do so on his own terms. He failed to minimally make a counter\noffer to the settlement offer. I find neither FC MC 20(c) nor (d) apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and\ncareful analysis.\n\n7\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. I considered the age of the debt and the fact he only\nhas one large debt. Applicant has the means to resolve the debt, but has not. He has made minimal\neffort to attempt to resolve it and only did so after his security clearance became an issue. I conclude\nApplicant continues to exercise poor judgment with regard to this debt and has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant argues that one reason he purchased the\nmotorcycle was because it saved him approximately $140 a month on gas.\n2\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 3, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nApplicant contends that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised\nby his multiple unpaid debts had been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant notes that\nthe Judge found in his favor with respect to five of the nine SOR allegations.  Applicant also argues\nthat he has acted reasonably in his efforts to resolve the debts that are the subject of the four\nremaining SOR allegations that the Judge found against him on.  He further complains that the Judge\ndrew certain unfavorable inferences from the record evidence, when that evidence in fact supported\na favorable inference.   Applicant\u2019s brief  essentially reargues his case with respect to the evidence\n2\nhe presented at the hearing, and provides addition statements as to the circumstances of his financial\nsituation.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Therefore,\nthe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s additional explanations as to the circumstances of his\nfinancial situation, and they do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-00799 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007). \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings, and the inferences drawn\nfrom those findings, reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence and are supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\n\n3\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul.19, 2007).  \u201cThus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03452 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  \u201cAn applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence,\nor an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthat the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, he still had\nsignificant outstanding debts and was still in the process of trying to resolve his financial problems.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nwere still ongoing and presented a security concern.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00799 at 2 (App.\nBd. Apr. 16, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  He found in favor of Applicant with respect\nto five of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which\nthe Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo. The favorable record evidence cited\nby Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.   Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable\nclearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

He was unemployed\nwhile attending college from January 2000 to February 2004, and accumulated several delinquent\n\n2\ndebts that remained unresolved.  In June 2005, his wife was laid off from her job, causing them to\ndefault on a home equity line of credit.  To avoid foreclosure, they filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nSecurity concerns based on financial considerations are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 12, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2007, and was heard on\nApril 17, 2007, as scheduled.  On my own motion, I amended the SOR to correctly reflect the suffix\nto Applicant\u2019s name (Transcript (Tr.) 46).  I kept the record open until May 2, 2007, to enable\nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence.  I received his additional evidence on April\n26, 2007, and it has been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) D.  DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript on April 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor.  He has worked for his current\nemployer since April 2006. He is regarded as hard-working, honest, family-oriented, and reliable\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A and B).  \nBefore his current employment, Applicant worked for a private employer from February 2004\nto January 2005, was briefly unemployed from January to March 2005, and then worked for another\nprivate company from March 2005 to March 2006.  He held a security clearance from 1992 to about\n1999, but it was administratively terminated when he was laid off.  He currently holds an interim\nclearance (Tr. 8).\nApplicant was married in November 1986 and divorced in August 1987.  He married his\ncurrent spouse in December 1989, and they have two children, ages 16 and 14. \nAfter his divorce in August 1987, his ex-wife kept an automobile, but Applicant remained\nliable for payment of the loan.  When his ex-wife defaulted on the payments, the creditor sought\npayment from Applicant.  Applicant and his second wife were expecting their first child.  He\nconsulted a lawyer, who advised filing a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He followed his lawyer\u2019s\nadvice and received a discharge in bankruptcy in June 1990 (Government Exhibit (GX) 5; Tr. 24-\n25).\nAfter Applicant was laid off from his job around 1999, he decided to begin college.  He was\nunemployed and supported by his wife from January 2000 to February 2004.  He and his wife had\n\n4\nno medical insurance, and they incurred the medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i (Tr.\n54), which remain unpaid. \nAt some time before December 2005, Applicant owned a lawn service business.  When he\nsold the business, he neglected to pay the phone bill (Tr. 34).  The delinquent phone bill is alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1.c.\nIn June 2005, Applicant used a home equity line of credit to borrow about $29,000, to\npurchase a $9,000 motorcycle and remodel his home.  He fell behind on the payments when his wife\nlost her job and was unemployed from April to July 2006.  Applicant and his wife also incurred\nseveral medical bills not covered by insurance that were referred to collection agencies in November\nand December 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i).  When he learned that foreclosure was imminent, he\nconsulted a credit counselor, who advised filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (Tr. 26, 52).\nAlthough his payments on the first mortgage and his automobiles were current, his lawyer advised\nthat he stop making payments on them and include all his debts in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy (Tr.\n27).  He filed the Chapter 13 petition in October 2006 (GX 2), and he began making payments to the\nbankruptcy trustee in November 2006 (Tr. 29).  All debts alleged in the SOR were included (Tr. 35-\n36).  At first, his payments to the trustee were $1,832 per month, but they have increased to $2,450\n(Tr. 28-29).  As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had made all required payments to the\nbankruptcy trustee (AX C; Tr. 30).  Two money orders were lost in the mail, and he is in the process\nof tracing them (Tr. 30).\nApplicant and his wife usually have a net monthly remainder of between $100 and $200 after\npaying all household expenses and the payments to the bankruptcy trustee (Tr. 32).  This calculation\nis consistent with the personal financial statement he filed in connection with his Chapter 13\nbankruptcy (AX D at 3).  They have no contingency funds to rely on if either of them is laid off\nagain.  \nApplicant hopes to terminate the bankruptcy early if he can refinance his house and use his\nequity to pay off the delinquent debts (Tr. 31).  He estimates he has about $75,000 in equity (Tr. 40).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n\n5\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  Guidelines \u00b6 19(a) applies where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 19(c) applies when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d  These two disqualifying conditions are established by the evidence in this case.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR\nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n\n6\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive\nprongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be established by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d\nor \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d  If any of the\nthree disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the\nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy was \u201clong ago,\u201d more than 17 years ago.  It also occurred\nunder circumstances unlikely to recur, i.e., a divorce and his ex-wife\u2019s default on a car note on which\nApplicant was jointly responsible.  Applicant acted responsibly at the time, and sought bankruptcy\nrelief so that he and his current wife could start with a clean financial slate.  I conclude the mitigating\ncondition in Guidelines \u00b6 20(a) is established, and I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nThe delinquent phone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was not due to circumstances beyond\nApplicant\u2019s control, but to neglect or forgetfulness.  The remaining debts alleged in the SOR and the\nChapter 13 bankruptcy were the result of Applicant\u2019s unemployment from January 2000 to February\n2004 and his wife\u2019s unemployment from April to July 2006.  Applicant\u2019s initial layoff in January\n2000 was beyond his control, but his decision to attend college rather than seek new employment\nwas voluntary and within his control. His wife\u2019s loss of employment for three months in 2006 was\nbeyond his control.  However, Applicant has been employed since February 2004, except for the\nthree-month period in 2005, but he took no action to resolve the delinquent installment accounts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g or the medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b61.i until he included them in his Chapter\n13 bankruptcy in October 2006.  All these debts were delinquent before his wife lost her job.  I\nconclude the mitigating condition in Guidelines \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the phone bill in SOR\n\u00b6 1.c, installment accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h, or the medical bills in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and I resolve\nthose debts against Applicant.  However, it is established for the default on the home equity line of\ncredit in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and the medical bill in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and I resolve these debts in his favor.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 20(c).  This mitigating condition also has two\nprongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  If the person has received counseling, there\nmust be clear indications the problem is being resolved or under control.  However, if the person has\nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or under control.\nApplicant received financial counseling before and during the Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nprocess, and the problem will be under control so long as he continues to make the required\npayments.  I conclude the mitigating condition in Guidelines \u00b6 20(c) is established.\n\n7\nFinally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 20(d).  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that\nshows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-\n0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past irresponsibility is not\nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition was not prompted by his desire to obtain a\nclearance, but rather it was a means of avoiding foreclosure on the family home.  He has included\nall his debts in the bankruptcy, and thus far he has made all required payments.  I conclude the\nmitigating condition in Guidelines \u00b6 20(d) is established.\nApplicant\u2019s home mortgage, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, was current until he decided to file his\npetition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  At that time, on the advice of his lawyer, he stopped making\npayments.  I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.e in his favor.\nHowever, Applicant receives limited benefit from Guidelines \u00b6 20(d).  He took no action to\nresolve most of the debts in the SOR until foreclosure on his home was imminent.  He has been\nmaking payments under the Chapter 13 bankruptcy for only about six months.  His delinquent debts\ncover a span of more than five years. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines\n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  Several of these factors are incorporated in the above discussion of Guideline F, but\nsome merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult and a dedicated husband and father.  He was articulate, candid,\nand sincere at the hearing.  He sincerely desires to right his financial ship.  Whether he has the\nfinancial acumen and discipline to do so remains to be seen.  He has lived on the financial edge since\nhe was laid off and decided to attend college in January 2000.  When he returned to work, he did\nnothing to take care of several old debts.  In June 2005, his financial situation was sufficiently secure\nthat he decided to borrow money against the family home to remodel it and purchase a $9,000\nmotorcycle, but he did nothing to resolve his old debts.  He is making his monthly payments required\nby the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but he is still living paycheck-to-paycheck.  He hopes to use his home\nequity to pay off the delinquent debts and terminate the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but it is not clear that\nhe will be able to afford increased house payments at his current income level.  He is not currently\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, because his debts are under control.  However, based\non his record of financial indiscipline, the likelihood of recurrence remains a concern.  He has not\nyet established a track record of financial responsibility.  \u201cOnly with the passage of time will there\nbe a track record that shows whether a person, through actions and conduct, is willing and able to\n\n8\nadhere to a stated intention to refrain from acting in a way that the person has acted in the past.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 97-0727, 1998 DOHA LEXIS 302 at *7 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998).  Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial track record may well improve with the passage of time, but a conditional or probationary\nclearance is not authorized.  .  See ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar.1,\n2000).  But see Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37-E3.1.39 (reconsideration after one year).\nThis case is a close call, but close cases must be resolved against an applicant.  Guidelines\n\u00b6 2(b).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his\nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He married for the third time in 2005; his previous marriages ended in divorce. He lives with his wife and two children. He is software engineer for a large publicly-traded company engaged in defense contracting. His employment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Armed Forces. He served in the Navy during 1989\u20131995; he served in the Air Force Reserve (active status) during 1995\u20131997; and he served in the Air Force Reserve Exhibit 6 (OGA letter, dated March 30, 2005). 4 3 (inactive status) during 1997\u20132000. He served as an enlisted servicemember attaining the pay grade of E-5. Applicant enrolled in college at a major state university upon his discharge from active military duty in 1995. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in about June 1998. He then began his first job as a software engineer for a large publicly- traded company. He worked there until May 2001, when he accepted a software engineer position for a privately-held company. That company was subsequently acquired by his current employer, a large publicly-traded company engaged in defense contracting.

Cervi, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence\nshows Applicant was denied program access in 2005, in part, because he claimed his\nadult brother as a dependent on his 1995, 2002, and 2003 federal income tax returns.\nThe other governmental agency (OGA) that took this action based its denial, in part, on\nadmissions Applicant made in 2003 that he fraudulently claimed his brother as a\ndependent for 1995 and 2002. Although the evidence as a whole is insufficient to satisfy\nthe willfulness requirement that applies to federal criminal-tax offenses, it does raise\nunmitigated personal conduct security concerns. Accordingly, as explained in further\ndetail below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJuly 16, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.7. \n2\n The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting documents, some\n3\nof which are identified as exhibits in this decision.  \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on November 4,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline E for personal conduct and Guideline J for criminal conduct. The\ngravamen of the SOR, under both guidelines, is that Applicant fraudulently claimed his\nbrother as a dependent on his federal income returns for tax years 1995, 2002, and\n2003. The SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative\njudge to decide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion. Neither Applicant nor\nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the\nwritten record.2\nOn or about February 24, 2010, the Agency submitted its written case consisting\nof all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-\n3\ncalled file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and received by him on\nMarch 31, 2010. He then had 30 days to submit a response setting forth objections,\nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation. He responded in a timely fashion with\ntwo written submissions. The case was assigned to me April 30, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He married for the\nthird time in 2005; his previous marriages ended in divorce. He lives with his wife and\ntwo children. He is software engineer for a large publicly-traded company engaged in\ndefense contracting. His employment history includes honorable service in the U.S.\nArmed Forces. He served in the Navy during 1989\u20131995; he served in the Air Force\nReserve (active status) during 1995\u20131997; and he served in the Air Force Reserve\n\n Exhibit 6 (OGA letter, dated March 30, 2005). \n4\n3\n(inactive status) during 1997\u20132000. He served as an enlisted servicemember attaining\nthe pay grade of E-5.  \nApplicant enrolled in college at a major state university upon his discharge from\nactive military duty in 1995. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in\nabout June 1998. He then began his first job as a software engineer for a large publicly-\ntraded company. He worked there until May 2001, when he accepted a software\nengineer position for a privately-held company. That company was subsequently\nacquired by his current employer, a large publicly-traded company engaged in defense\ncontracting.   \nThe genesis of this case may be traced to about March 2005, when the OGA\ndenied Applicant program access, which is also known as access to sensitive\ncompartmented information (SCI). The OGA\u2019s denial letter provided the specific\nreasons, in relevant part, as follows:\nA review of your file indicates you were first submitted for program access\nin May 2003. Although that request was canceled in January 2004, you\nwere resubmitted for program access in February 2004. During security\nprocessing, you consented to a polygraph [examination] regarding criminal\nactivity. During the polygraph [examination] in August 2003, you admitted\nfraudulently claiming your brother as a dependent on your 1995 and 2002\nfederal income tax returns. You stated your brother had been in and out of\nprison all of his adult life. Although you had no contact with your brother in\n1995, you knew he was not in prison and made the decision to claim him\nas a dependent on your tax return. In January 2003 your brother showed\nup at your home after his release from prison, and you allowed him to stay\nwith you for several weeks and provided him with financial assistance. You\nexplained you claimed your brother as a dependent for the 2002 tax year\nbecause you used part of your 2002 income to support him and estimated\nsaving approximately $1,000 on your taxes because of this deduction. You\nadmitted these deductions were wrong and could not be justified if\nchallenged by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). \nWhen contacted by a government representative in December 2004, you\nstated you also claimed your brother as a tax deduction for 2003 because\nyou provided him with shelter and financial assistance for two weeks in\n2003. You believed claiming your brother as a dependent fell into a gray\narea and indicated you would be willing to pay any taxes owed if required\nto do so.  \n4\n\n Exhibit 6 (DoD letter, dated April 5, 2005). \n5\n Exhibit 6 (Applicant\u2019s letters, dated April 15, 2005, and April 27, 2005). \n6\n Exhibit 6 (OGA letter, dated October 20, 2005). \n7\n Exhibit 5. \n8\n Exhibit 6 (DSS letter, dated March 3, 2006).\n9\n Exhibit 6 (Applicant\u2019s affidavit, as transcribed in typewritten form).\n10\n4\nThe OGA\u2019s file is not included in the FORM. As a result of the OGA\u2019s denial, Applicant\u2019s\naccess to a Department of Defense special access program was terminated in April\n2005.5\nApplicant sought a review or appeal of the OGA\u2019s denial. His overall contention\nwas that he filed his federal income tax returns as he understood the applicable IRS\nrules and regulations at the time.  In October 2005, Applicant withdrew his appeal of the\n6\ndecision to deny him program access.  He did so, although he still disagreed with the\n7\nadverse decision, due to ongoing medical or health issues. \nIn November 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application that is\nthe basis for this case.  In doing so, he acknowledged having a clearance or access\n8\nauthorization denied, and he provided a detailed explanation in the remarks section of\nthe application. He was apparently granted a security clearance by the Defense\nDepartment, because in March 2006 the Defense Security Service (DSS) advised\nApplicant that the security clearance granted to him in connection with his current\nemployment was suspended.  The DSS letter explained that the suspension, which is\n9\nan interim action, was based on the OGA\u2019s decision to deny him access to SCI. \nMore than two years later in September 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a\ngovernmental representative as part of the background investigation. The result of that\ninterview was a signed affidavit regarding his federal income tax returns for 1995, 2002,\nand 2003.  In the affidavit, Applicant explained he believed he was entitled to claim his\n10\nbrother as a dependent since he was the main source of support for his brother during\nthose years. He acknowledged that he may have been wrong for 1995, but he was\nunable to obtain any information from the IRS about his 1995 return.   \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant, expressed frustration with the security\nclearance process and maintained that he is hiding nothing and has not engaged in any\nintentional criminal or fraudulent activity. He explained his position, in part, as follows:\n \nAs stated in my Answer, I have repeatedly advised every investigator who\nhas asked me that I realize now (as of 2005 when these questions were\nbeing asked) that I was wrong about claiming my brother as a dependent\non my 1995 tax return, but that I did not intentionally or fraudulently\n\n Applicant\u2019s response to FORM at 1.\n11\n Applicant\u2019s response to FORM at 3\u20134 (emphasis in original). \n12\n See Exhibits 7\u20139 for all information in this paragraph (IRS Publication 501 on Exemptions, Standard\n13\nDeduction, and Filing Information, for tax years 1995, 2002, and 2003).\n5\nundertake that action. As stated in all of the evidence, I attempted to\ncorrect this but was unable to obtain a copy of my return and was advised\nthat ultimately amending the return would raise more questions than it\nanswered. That year [1995] I only had about $10K in total income. As I\nalso stated in my Answer, I have repeatedly stated that my ability to claim\nmy brother as a dependent in 2002 was in a gray area and that I believe I\nhad the ability to claim my brother as a dependent in 2003 based upon the\nfact that I was his sole source of income prior to his incarceration.11\n* * * *\nWhen asked about the 1995 return, I explained all the facts to the best of\nmy ability and did attempt to correct the situation as stated in my prior\ndocuments. When I was asked about the 2002 return, I openly stated,\nbased upon what the investigator was telling me, that it was possible that\nclaiming my brother as a dependent was incorrect because although I\nused 2002 funds to support him in 2003, I did not actually give him the\nmoney in 2002. But I did not know that when I filed my returns for 2002, so\nI was not admitting to defrauding the government, as has been asserted.\nWhen questioned by the investigator in 2004, I also voluntarily disclosed\nto the investigator that I had claimed my brother for 2003. I wanted to be\nsure he knew that information if he believed what I had done in 2002 was\nincorrect. I asked the investigator at the time if I should amend my 2002\nreturn and he stated that it was not necessary based upon their\ninvestigation and it would not likely have an effect one way or the other on\nmy security clearance. In addition, with regard to my 2003 return, as I\nhave stated, I asked the advice of my roommate/attorney on claiming my\nbrother. I had no reason to believe that what I did was inappropriate.12\nA dependency exemption, the terminology used by the IRS, is an exemption\nallowed for each person claimed as a dependent.  An exemption reduces a taxpayer\u2019s\n13\ntaxable income by the amount allowed for that tax year. For 1995, a taxpayer was\nallowed to deduct $2,500 for each exemption claimed; for 2002 it was $3,000; and for\n2003 it was $3,050. A dependency exemption is allowed if the taxpayer can show that\nall five of the dependency tests are met. The five tests include a support test, which\nrequires the taxpayer to provide more than half of a person\u2019s total support during the\ncalendar year. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n14\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n17\n6\nTo sum up, and in light of the evidence as a whole, I make specific findings of\nfact as follows:\n\u2022\nApplicant admits filing federal income tax returns for tax years 1995, 2002, and\n2003, wherein he claimed his brother as a dependency exemption. To date, none\nof those returns were amended, modified, or otherwise changed.\n\u2022\nFor the three years in question, the Government has not produced any evidence\nshowing the IRS has conducted an audit of Applicant\u2019s returns; there is no\nindication the IRS has assessed additional tax or interest against Applicant; there\nis no indication the IRS has imposed a penalty, based on civil fraud or civil\nnegligence, against Applicant; and there is no indication the IRS has referred this\nmatter to its criminal investigation division, which investigates reports of\nviolations of federal criminal-tax statutes.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n14\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n15\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n16\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n17\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n21\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n22\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n23\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n24\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31, and 32 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n25\n7\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n18\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n19\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n20\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n21\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.22\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.23\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material\ninformation, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person\nconcept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n24\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be\n25\nquestioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a criminal history record\nregardless of whether the criminal conduct at issue has been subject to prosecution and\nadjudication in a court of law. The overall concern under Guideline J is that:\n\n AG \u00b6 30. \n26\n 498 U.S. 192, at 201 (1991).\n27\n  498 U.S. at 201-02.\n28\n8\nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n26\nAs set forth in SOR \u00b6 2, the issue here is whether Applicant engaged in criminal\nconduct by fraudulently claiming his brother as a dependency exemption on his federal\nincome tax returns in 1995, 2002, and 2003. Nowhere in the SOR does it cite to or\nmention any particular law or statute that was violated by Applicant. For cases involving\nunadjudicated criminal conduct, like this case, the best practice is likely for the SOR to\nallege the criminal conduct by referring to the particular state or federal law or statute\nthe Government contends was violated by an applicant. This may also be the best\npractice when alleging unadjudicated complex or white-collar crimes like criminal-tax\noffenses. Three of the more common offenses are tax evasion under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201,\nwillfully failing to file tax returns under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, and willfully filing false tax\nreturns under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206. Although the deficiency in the SOR might not satisfy\nthe well-settled law that an SOR will be as detailed and comprehensive as permitted by\nnational security, I am satisfied Applicant had sufficient notice of the allegations against\nhim and an opportunity to respond. In addition, Applicant suffered no unfair prejudice\nbecause the criminal conduct allegation is decided for him as discussed below.\nGiven the criminal conduct allegations, it is necessary to briefly review general\nprinciples of criminal-tax law. In United States v. Cheek, the Supreme Court reviewed a\nseries of tax cases and concluded that \u201cthe standard for the statutory willfulness\nrequirement [for federal criminal-tax offenses] is the \u2018voluntary, intentional violation of a\nknown legal duty.\u2019\u201d  The Cheek court also explained the Government's requirement to\n27\nprove willfulness for criminal-tax offenses:\nWilfulness, as construed by our prior decisions in criminal tax cases,\nrequires the Government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the\ndefendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily\nand intentionally violated that duty.  \n28\nHere, the evidence shows Applicant\u2019s use of the dependency exemption for tax\nyears 1995, 2002, and 2003, was without factual support. Simply put, Applicant has not\nproduced sufficient documentary evidence to prove that he was entitled to claim the\ndependency exemption. But when applying the willfulness requirement as articulated in\nCheek, the evidence is insufficient to establish a voluntary and intentional violation of a\nknown legal duty amounting to a federal criminal-tax offense. I am not persuaded the\nevidence rises to the level of criminal fraud (i.e., willful conduct). Accordingly, Guideline\nJ is decided for Applicant. \n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the security concerns and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n29\n AG \u00b6 15. \n30\n9\nTurning to personal conduct under Guideline E,  it includes issues of false\n29\nstatements and credible adverse information that may not be enough to support action\nunder any other guideline. The overall concern under Guideline E is that:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n30\nAs set forth in SOR \u00b6 1, the issue here is that in 2005 the OGA denied Applicant\nprogram access for security concerns raised under criminal conduct and financial\nconsiderations. Applicant admits the OGA\u2019s denial, but disputes the basis for it. The\nbasis, as alleged in the SOR, was Applicant\u2019s use of the dependency exemption for his\nfederal income tax returns in 1995, 2002, and 2003, which are discussed below.\nFor tax year 1995, Applicant\u2019s use of the dependency exemption is without\nfactual support, and he admits as much. But I have no concerns about Applicant\u2019s 1995\nreturn because it appears he claimed the dependency exemption due to ignorance or a\nmisunderstanding of the applicable rules or both. In 1995, Applicant was still a relatively\nyoung man of 24, fresh off of active duty in the Navy, and it is likely that he did not\nappreciate the nature and consequences of his actions. \n \nThe 2002 and 2003 returns are a different matter. By then, Applicant had\nattended college, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, and was working as a software engineer.\nHe was several years older and more experienced in the ways of the world by then. For\ntax year 2002, Applicant\u2019s use of the dependency exemption is without factual support\nbecause he did provide sufficient information to meet the support test for a dependency\nexemption. He provided the financial support to his brother in tax year 2003, but says he\nused 2002 funds to do so. Standing alone, his explanation or justification is highly\nquestionable if not deceptive.\nFor tax year 2003, Applicant\u2019s use of the dependency exemption is also without\nfactual support. Although he claims he provided financial support to his brother for a\nperiod in early 2003, before his brother\u2019s incarceration, Applicant has not provided\nsufficient documentary evidence to meet the support test for a dependency exemption.\nMoreover, his use of the dependency exemption for the 2003 return came after he had\nbeen put on notice that it was an issue or concern for security officials. That action is\ndifficult to reconcile with simple common sense and it is indicative of intentional conduct.\n\n See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 731 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9  ed., W est 2009) (\u201cThe distinction between an\n31\nth\nintentional (i.e., civil) and willful (i.e., criminal) fraud is not always clear, but civil fraud carries only a monetary,\nnoncriminal penalty.\u201d).\n AG \u00b6 16(d). \n32\n AG \u00b6 17. \n33\n10\nTaken together, using the dependency exemption for both tax years 2002 and\n2003 amounts to a deceptive or fraudulent financial practice. In other words, the\nevidence shows he engaged in intentional\u2014but not willful\u2014conduct in order to illegally\nreduce his federal tax liability.  This is sufficient to establish credible adverse\n31\ninformation supporting an assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations under\nGuideline E.   \n32\nThere are several conditions that may mitigate security concerns under Guideline\nE.  The seven conditions are as follows:\n33\n(a) The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) The refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) The offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) The individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) The individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) The information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n34\n11\n(g) Association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nOf those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here is subparagraph (c).\nCertainly, the relevant circumstances surrounding the conduct took place several years\nago during 2003\u20132004, when Applicant filed his returns for tax years 2002 and 2003. It\ndid not involve a large sum of money. There is no indication that Applicant has engaged\nin similar tax-related conduct. Indeed, he has not provided financial support to his\nbrother since early 2003. Applicant receives credit in mitigation for these matters. \nWhat is missing here is substantial evidence of reform and rehabilitation. First,\none obvious remedy is filing amended returns for tax years 2002 and 2003. But\nApplicant has not filed amended returns, and he is unlikely to do so because that action\nmay trigger an audit by the IRS. Second, he could have presented persuasive evidence\nto support his belief that the dependency exemption was valid for his 2002 and 2003\nreturns. Considering this matter has been ongoing since about 2005, Applicant should\nhave had ample time and resources to obtain an opinion letter, from a certified public\naccountant, an enrolled agent, a tax attorney, or another tax expert, validating his use of\nthe dependency exemption. Had Applicant taken either of these actions, neither of\nwhich is greatly burdensome, I may have decided this case for him. Although there is\nsome evidence in mitigation, the credit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s use of the\ndependency exemption for his 2002 and 2003 federal income tax returns justifies\ncurrent doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and\nthe clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national\nsecurity. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person\nconcept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his\n34\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is\ndecided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(1):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(2):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(3):\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

These revised AG replaced those found in enclosure 2 of the Directive,\nwhich is pending revision to incorporate them. Copies of the applicable AG were provided to Applicant with the SOR.\n \n2\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He still owes a significant\nnumber and amount of delinquent debts that resulted from his failed attempt to start a restaurant\nbusiness. Although he has resumed stable employment and is working to pay off his debts, it will\nbe several years before his financial situation is solvent. Security concerns raised by financial\nconsiderations were not mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on February 7, 2006, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor as a project management specialist. On May 25, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended. The SOR detailed reasons, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\n1\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance\nfor Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on a notarized, annotated copy of the SOR,\ndated July 3, 2007, admitting the truth of some of the allegations and denying others, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was then assigned to me on August 7, 2007.\nA Notice of Hearing was issued on August 9, 2007, and the hearing was held as scheduled on August\n28, 2007. During the hearing, the Government submitted a motion to amend the SOR by correcting\ncertain obvious typographical errors. This motion was granted at the hearing, without objection, and\nDepartment Counsel made pen and ink corrections to the original SOR. The Government offered six\nexhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, and admitted without\nobjection. Applicant testified, but offered no documentary evidence or exhibits. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr) on September 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant formally admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i,\n1.k, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o, pertaining to financial considerations under AG F. Those admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining allegations under AG F in his\nresponse to the SOR. After a complete and thorough review of all the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\n\nGE 1 (e-QIP, dated Feb. 7, 2006) at 6, 11-12, 37.  \n2\nTr at 52-55.\n3\nSee also, GE 3 (credit bureau report (CBR) dated Jul 18, 2007); GE 4 (CBR dated May 11, 2007); GE 5 (CBR\n4\ndated Dec. 12, 2006; and GE 6 (CBR dated Mar. 8, 2006) documenting these debts, as well as those debts Applicant\ndisputed for reasons discussed below. The \u201cdispute\u201d noted in his response to the SOR, concerning the \u00b6 1.h debt, was\nwith the date rather than the amount due or its delinquent status. Tr at 43-44. (Note: the transcript incorrectly reads,\n\u201cdebts\u201d on page 43, lines 11 and 13, when Applicant used the word, \u201cdates.\u201d) \nTr at 85-86, 99-100. \n5\nTr at 31, 53; GE 2 (Interrogatories) at attachment 8.\n6\nTr at 83.\n7\n3\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security\nclearance for the first time.  He is married, for the second time, with seven children ranging from a\n2\nson who just finished undergraduate studies at Columbia to a newborn. He has two other children\nin college. His wife does not work because daycare for their three pre-school children would cost\nmore than she can earn. He initially came to the United States from Nigeria in 1982 for college and\ngraduate school, and became a naturalized citizen in 1993. \nApplicant formerly lived in a city whose economy depends heavily on high-technology\ncorporations. He had a good job with a large corporation and good credit until he decided to open\na restaurant business. In mid 2003, he quit his job to work in the restaurant full time. Unfortunately,\nan economic downturn caused massive layoffs and his business began to fail about six months after\nit opened. Applicant stopped paying personal bills and incurred additional debt, both commercial and\nto friends, trying to keep the business afloat. He took a consulting job to generate extra income, but\nfinally realized the business could not be saved. In April 2005, he relocated and started his current\nemployment. He now makes $84,000 per year and is working to pay off some of his delinquent\ndebts. He is current on his rent and car payments, and is not incurring additional delinquent debt.3\nApplicant admitted to owing $11,071 in delinquent debts, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.k,\n1.m,1.n, and 1.o.   He further admitted that he most probably owes the $1,349 delinquent debt\n4\nalleged in \u00b6 1.f, but denied it because he is not sure which debt that is.  He also admitted that he owes\n5\nthe $9,427 debt placed for collections as alleged in \u00b6 1.g, but denied that it is delinquent since he is\nmaking regular payments of $102 per month under a repayment plan agreement with the creditor.6\nThus, the total SOR-alleged debt that Applicant admittedly still owes is $21,847. In addition, he\nowes an estimated $12,000 to $15,000 to close friends who informally lent him more than $25,000\nto help keep his family going while he tried to save his restaurant business.  \n7\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b alleged 18 delinquent medical debts, totaling $4,202. He does not intend\nto pay these debts, testifying that they are overcharges by the medical providers. He said his\ninsurance paid their maximum allowable amounts and he paid his deductibles and co-pays, but the\nproviders wanted more than his insurance would allow and billed him for the difference. He does\n\nTr at 34-36, 60-64.\n8\nTr at 36-37, 44-47, 65, 70-73.\n9\nGE 2 at attachments 2 through 4; GE 3 at 4 (item number six); Tr at 37-41.\n10\nTr at 29-32, 48-50, 75-78.\n11\nTr at 52-55.\n12\n4\nnot feel he owes these debts, but they are not removed from his CBRs because the creditors\ndocumented valid claims when he disputed them.8\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.j, and 1.l, totaling only $660, involve three close-out\nutility bills and one apartment cleaning fee claimed by the creditors after Applicant moved various\ntimes. He has disputed owing each of them, but decided it is not worth it to return to the various\nlocations to fight them in court. He does not plan to pay them and, other than reporting them to the\ncredit bureaus, none of the creditors are actively seeking payment.  \n9\nApplicant fully resolved the $7,383 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e in 2005.  He\n10\nconsulted a debt consolidation service, but calculated that it would merely cost him significant\nadditional interest and fees to enter their repayment plan. He has refused advice to file for\nbankruptcy, as he considers that dishonorable and intends to pay his debts when he can. His approach\nto debt repayment is to save enough money to approach his creditors, one at a time, and negotiate\na figure at which they are willing to settle the debt in full. He accomplished this with some of his\ncreditors. In July 2006, he decided to start paying down his informal debts to friends, with available\nfunds at the rate of at least $1,000 per month.  At this rate it will be at least another year before they\n11\nare repaid, although he will have an additional $650 per month available when his current auto lease\nexpires next January. He expects he will not be able to repay all of his delinquencies until late 2009\nat the earliest.12\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the AG are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise\nsecurity concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns.\nApplicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke\nan individual's eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\n\nAG \u00b6 2.\n13\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n14\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n15\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n16\n5\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n13\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n14\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n15\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n16\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n18\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nAG \u00b6 18.\n19\n6\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n17\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n18\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned,\u201d so the decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an\nindication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and\nimpartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\nunfavorable. The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFinancial considerations raise security concerns when a person has significant\ndelinquent debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d19\nI have considered all of  the Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC), and\nfind that FC DC 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC 19(c) (\u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply to Applicant\u2019s situation and raise security concerns. He\nadmittedly owes almost $22,000 in SOR-alleged delinquent debts, which he does not intend to begin\n\n7\nrepaying for at least a year, while he repays $12,000 to $15,000 in informal loans from friends. He\ndisputes owing, and does not intend to repay, another $4,860 in medical, utility and apartment\ncleaning bills that are sufficiently legitimate to remain on his credit report after he challenged them.\nHe did not meet his burden of proving that these bills are invalid. No other FC DC applies. \nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) that\nmight apply to Applicant\u2019s inability to meet, and history of not meeting, his financial obligations.\nFC MC 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not apply since his delinquent indebtedness\ncontinues to date.\nFC MC 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d)\napplies to some degree. Applicant chose to leave secure employment to begin a restaurant business.\nThis business failed, and he chose to continue trying to make it work by allowing other debts to go\nunpaid. When he realized he could not save the business, he again obtained stable employment and\nis working to reduce his debts rather than declaring bankruptcy and avoiding them. However, the\npressures resulting from the delinquent indebtedness and a bad credit rating remain. \nFC MC 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) was not established\nby Applicant. He chose not to follow a debt consolidation program, did not follow the advice of\ncounsellors, and his financial difficulties are not yet at the point of being resolved or under control.\nFC MC 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d) also does not apply to mitigate security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation. He showed that he is making regular payments toward one major delinquent debt, and\nclaimed without corroboration that he was making significant monthly payments toward debts he\nowes to friends from informal loans. He does not intend to resume paying his SOR-listed debts until\nabout a year from now, and does not intend to pay a significant portion of that debt at all.\nApplicant disputes the legitimacy of some of his past-due debts, but presented no\ndocumentation to substantiate the basis of the disputes, or actions to resolve them. Accordingly, FC\nMC 20(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d) does not mitigate security concerns, even with\nrespect to the portion of the indebtedness he disputes. No unexplained affluence concerns were\nraised, so FC MC 20(f) has no bearing in this case.\nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. The nature, extent, and seriousness of his delinquent\nindebtedness may be coming under control, and is not getting worse. However, his financial situation\nremains tenuous, with large ongoing family obligations and significant off-the-books debt in addition\nto that listed in the SOR. Applicant is a mature, educated adult professional who took a risk starting\n\n8\na business that failed, and offered no reason he should not be considered accountable for his\nvoluntary actions. He has secured good employment and is repaying debts as he can, which is some\nevidence of rehabilitation or other permanent behavioral changes. The evidence shows that\ncontinuation of these problems is highly probable over the next few years, although he is resolving\nthe debts as quickly and responsibly as he is able to do. Accordingly, I do not find that Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns raised by the financial considerations of his current situation. With\ncontinued efforts, he may resolve and mitigate these concerns in a few years, but it is not clearly in\nthe interest of national security to grant him access to classified material right now.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, GUIDELINE F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Those\n1\nfavorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\n2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding the\ntrustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised\nby her history of financial difficulties had not been mitigated because (a) her indebtedness was due\nto a circumstance beyond her control, a medical problem, (b) her unpaid debts are old and she is\ncurrent on all debts accrued since December 2003, and (c) she has paid off, or is making payments\non, a number of her debts.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors   requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ADP Case No.\n05-03939 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 1, 2006).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still\nhad significant outstanding debts, including an unpaid state tax lien of approximately $1,808 and\napproximately $45,907 in unpaid student loans.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 05-16601\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant\nagainst the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  He found in favor of Applicant with respect\nto a number of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nADP Case No. 03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2006).  The Board does not review a case de novo.\nThe Board need not agree with a Judge\u2019s decision in order to find it sustainable.

As required by Department of Defense (DoD)\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation),\nand DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February\n15, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision\u2013concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting on March 8, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on March 22, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 30, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for April 24, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\neligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position. The Government offered seven exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, and admitted without objection. Applicant\ntestified and offered five exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, and\nadmitted without objection. The record was left open to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit\nadditional material. She did so in a timely manner. The documents, which included Applicant\u2019s letter\ndated May 2, 2007 (AE F), a standard operating procedure (AE G), Equifax letter dated April 2,\n2007, and page from a credit report (AE H), bank statement dated January 7, 2007 (AE I), bank\nstatement dated May 2, 2007 (AE J), Equifax letter dated March 7, 2007 (AE K), workforce user\nguide (AE L), Applicant\u2019s fax cover sheet dated May 15, 2007 (AE M), and state tax letter dated\nMay 11, 2007 (AE N), were admitted without objection.

In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal government contractor. She attended\ncollege, but did not graduate. She has two teenage children. She left college when her second child\nwas born. The father of her two children is approximately two years delinquent on his child support\npayments.1\nA judgment of $2,895 was entered against Applicant in December 2002, on behalf of a\nhospital.

Applicant had extensive medical problems in 2003, as discussed below. She states her\nmedical issues were the reason she did not file her tax returns. Her state issued a tax lien against her\nin July 2006, for $6,563. Applicant submitted documents from her state dated April 13, 2007,\nshowing balances with penalties and interest of $661 for tax year 2002, and $898 for tax year 2003.\nApplicant submitted documentation that she electronically filed her state tax returns for tax years\n2002 and 2003, on April 11, 2007. The tax due of $599 and $409 is the same amount reflected on\nthe state documents, before the state added penalties and interest. After the hearing, Applicant\nsubmitted a payment agreement from the state, wherein Applicant would pay $157 per month, for\ntwelve months, starting June 16, 2007. The balance due is $1,808.3\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, in the amount of $231 is for satellite television services. Applicant\nsubmitted documentation with her response to the SOR, that the debt was down to $60, and that the\nfinal $60 was scheduled to be deducted from Applicant\u2019s bank account.4\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, in the amount of $206 is for a dishonored check. Applicant denies\nthis debt. Equifax has deleted this debt.5\nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges three medical debts, totaling about $190. One of the three debts has been\npaid. Applicant had a difficult time identifying the creditors as the credit reports and SOR do not\nname the creditor, they simply call them \u201cmedical.\u201d The credit bureau report (CBR) of April 24,\n2007, only lists one of the three debts, and shows that as paid.6\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, in the amount of $615 is for cable television services. Applicant stated\nshe disputed this debt, and that she provided the cable company with a receipt. She stated the cable\ncompany was satisfied with the receipt and said they would remove it from her credit report. The\ndebt does not appear on the CBR of April 24, 2007. Applicant testified that she would submit a copy\nof the receipt which she gave to the cable company. She did not provide anything regarding this debt\nin her post-hearing submission.7\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, in the amount of $563 is for telephone services. Applicant stated that\nshe made payment arrangements with this company. She made a payment of $145 on January 18,\n2007, and a $50 payment on April 18, 2007.8\nApplicant has delinquent student loans owed to the U.S. Department of Education, totaling\napproximately $45,900. She testified she intends to pay this debt. She stated the debt has been\ntransferred several times and it has been difficult to make payment arrangements. She stated she was\n\nTr. at 25, 48-49; AE C.\n9\nTr. at 29-31; AE E.\n10\nTr. at 32, 57-58.\n11\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n12\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n13\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n14\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n15\n4\ntold she would have to make a $1,000 payment to the account in order to set up monthly payments\nof $315. She was unable to raise the $1,000 to start paying the debt. The Department of the Treasury\ncollected $613 and $588 from Applicant\u2019s federal income tax refund on March 30, 2007, and\nforwarded the money to the Department of Education. Applicant testified that she recently called the\nDepartment of Education, which told her they do not currently have the debt, but that she could start\nmaking payments on the debt. Applicant stated she would start making payments on the 30  of April.\nth\nShe did not provide documentation of a payment toward this debt in her post-hearing submission.\nApplicant still owes the debt, minus $1,201, collected from her income tax refund. 9\nApplicant had substantial medical problems beginning around December 2002. She was\nscheduled for surgery in April 2003. She was placed under anesthesia and preliminary procedures\nwere started when the operation had to be stopped because of equipment malfunction. The operation\nwas rescheduled and conducted two weeks later. Applicant had another operation in November 2003.\nShe estimates she lost about six months work because of her illness and surgeries.  \n10\nApplicant has received on-line credit counseling. She has worked at her current position for\nabout 18 months. She received good reviews and a raise.  \n11\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations.\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the\nDirective before any determination may be made.12\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n13\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n14\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed by a memorandum from the Deputy\n15\nUndersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) dated November 19, 2004, to apply\nthe due process provisions of the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II,\nand including ADP III positions. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases.\n\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n16\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n23\n5\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026 assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  The\n16\ngovernment has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less\n17\nthan a preponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to\n18\nan applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case\nagainst him or her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n19\nfavorable clearance decision.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n20\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether\n21\nan applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of\nprotecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\n22\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for\n23\naccess to sensitive positions.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each determination must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\n\n6\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply in this case. Applicant has substantial delinquent debt, much of which is unpaid.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the person received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and FC MC 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue).\nApplicant still owes several creditors, including delinquent student loans of more than\n$44,000, and back state taxes. FC MC 20(a) does not apply.\nApplicant had extensive medical problems, resulting in medical bills, time off work, and loss\nof income. I find her medical problems constitute a condition that was beyond her control. It has been\nmore than three years since her operations. Applicant has paid some of her medical bills, but not\nothers. Her medical problems explain why she had large medical bills. The loss of income during her\nillness explains why she would have financial issues in 2003, and for some time thereafter. It does\nnot explain why she defaulted on her student loans years before her medical problems. Applicant\nstated she did not file her state tax returns for 2002 and 2003, because of her ongoing illness. There\ncan be no excuse for not filing them until April 2007. I also considered that the father of Applicant\u2019s\ntwo children is about two years behind on child support. I find FC MC 20(b) applicable to Applicant\u2019s\nmedical expenses. I find it partially applicable to her remaining debts.\nApplicant has received on-line credit counseling. She has paid some of her debts, but still\nowes more than $48,000. FC MC 20(c) is partially applicable in that Applicant has received some\ncounseling. It is not totally applicable, as there is not a clear indication that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems are being resolved or are under control. Applicant has not done enough to show a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, sufficient to act as a mitigating condition\nfor all her debts. Applicant has established FC MC 20(d) for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g. It is not\napplicable to the remaining debts.\nI find FC MC 20(e) at least partially applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. The debts do not\nappear on the most recent credit report. \n\n7\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant has extensive delinquent debt, totaling more than $48,000. She defaulted on her\nstudent loans years ago. They remain unpaid except for what has been obtained from her income tax\nrefunds. She did not file her state tax returns for several years, and owes her state for back taxes. I\nconsidered that Applicant had significant medical issues, which contributed to her financial problems.\nThe father of her two children is a \u201cdeadbeat dad,\u201d who is about two years delinquent on his child\nsupport payments. Applicant\u2019s medical problems do not explain why she defaulted on her student\nloans years before her medical problems arose. It also does not account for why she did not file her\nstate tax returns for tax years 2002 and 2003, until recently. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable\nemployment information.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in\nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based\non her financial issues. Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position.

Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, dated February 21, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations\nset forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2007. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued May 8, 2007, for a hearing held on June 1, 2007. The Government\nintroduced three exhibits at the hearing and requested that administrative notice be taken of eleven\nofficial government documents. The Applicant introduced one exhibit. All exhibits were admitted\ninto evidence. The Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left open for submission\nof additional materials by Applicant and three additional documents were submitted on July 12,\n2007, and admitted in evidence. The transcript was received on June 13, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant has denied all allegations under Foreign Preference (Guideline C) and under\nForeign Influence (Guideline B), and offered explanatory information at the hearing and in his post-\nhearing submission. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete\nreview of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following\nadditional findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a principal defense contractor working as a\nmechanical engineer on structural analysis. He served a mandatory two year period of military\nservice from 1978-1980 in the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a maintenance officer before entering\na Taiwan university from which he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1987\nto study until 1993 at a leading engineering school in the U.S., from which he received both a\nMaster\u2019s degree and Ph.D. He continued in a faculty research position for four years and became a\ncitizen in 2003. Since then he has worked for two hi-tech companies. He applied for a security\nclearance on November 11, 2005, and held an interim clearance until this proceeding was initiated.\n\n3\n \nApplicant\u2019s father, brother, and three sisters are citizens of Taiwan. His father is 86 years old\nand retired. His brother operates a family business, started by their father, manufacturing machines\nto make packing material which he sells in southeast Asia. One of his sisters works in the family\ncompany, the second is a part-time bookkeeper, and the third is retired. He gives a gift of $2,500 a\nyear to his relatives, although they are self sufficient and do not need help. None of his relatives\nworked for the Taiwan government. His father and oldest sister visited him in the U.S. in 2005. His\nprincipal contacts with his relatives are telephone calls 2-3 times a year. \nApplicant held a passport of Taiwan after he became a U.S. citizen but used only his U.S.\npassport to travel. He did not realize the possible security consideration of the passport until this\nmatter arose. His last trip to Taiwan to visit family was in 2005. He also traveled there four times\nin 2003-2004 because of an accident, illness, and death of his mother. He may return again sometime\nsoon to visit his father. The record was left open to provide him an opportunity to provide evidence\nof surrender of his passport. He established that he had surrendered and invalidated his Taiwan\npassport with the security office of his employer (Exh. B 2 and 3). \nApplicant is married to a college professor with the state university system in their state of\nresidence. They have no children. His salary is $118,000 per annum and he has assets of\napproximately $500,000, including the equity in his home, and savings accounts. He has no financial\ninterests in Taiwan. His hobbies are tennis and music. \nApplicant has been fully briefed on security requirements by his company and has a keen\ninterest in preserving U.S. technology, particularly against encroachments by the PRC (Tr. 56). He\nloves his work, and is very proud of his U.S. education. He appreciates the responsibilities which\nhe has been given. He is proud to be giving something in return for his citizenship. He is well\nregarded by his colleagues (Exh. A). He follows the rules in the company for all matters and knows\nthe rules for possible security issues require immediate reporting to security officers.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\n\n4\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR: \nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion (AG \u00b6 7a). Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of\nfamily members living abroad, the Government established a basis for concern over foreign\ninfluence. The Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which\nrefutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nBy virtue of the relationships of the foreign family members, Applicant\u2019s contacts, though\ninfrequent, cannot be deemed casual. Mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a\ndetermination that the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which the\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual group or government and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8a). The other relevant\nMC is that the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,that\nhe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8b). While\nApplicant\u2019s father lives in Taiwan, he is a an octogenerian and fully retired. His sisters and brother\nare either retired or in commercial activities totally unrelated to the government of Taiwan. The\ngovernment acknowledged that the type of work done by the family provides a lesser  security risk\nthan that found in the usual foreign influence case (Tr. 52). I find that both mitigating conditions are\napplicable. \nWhile there is evidence that Taiwan has engaged in economic and military espionage, and\nthat the PRC may use it as a source of information as stated in official documents (Exhs. VII, X, and\nXI), the U.S. has consistently supported the democratically elected government of Taiwan for it\u2019s\nefforts at pluralization and multi-party elections (Exh. II). The U.S. regards Taiwan as a key ally in\nAsia. Applicant shows no loyalty to Taiwan or the PRC and is a competent professional who knows\nhow to deal with any pressures that might be brought against him by an agent of a foreign\ngovernment.\nThe applicable guidelines for Foreign Preference Guideline C provide that an individual who\n\n5\nacts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States\n(AG \u00b6 9). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include the\npossession of a current foreign passport (AG \u00b6 10a 1). Security concerns may be mitigated by a\nproviding evidence that the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated. (AG \u00b6 11e). I conclude from the evidence submitted showing\nsurrender of the passport to security authorities by Applicant, that the allegation has been mitigated.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is a person of substance and veracity who is highly educated. He has a responsible\nposition of trust, and is doing a good job for his company. He provided sincere and credible\ntestimony as to his relationship with his family, his motivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. He has\nestablished a successful life here building financial and scholarly ties to the U.S. He has a strong\nfinancial stake in the U.S. and none to Taiwan. His contacts with his family are minimal and only\nto continue his family obligations. He has no deference to or loyalty to his country of origin.\nWhile the U.S. has had concerns regarding industrial espionage from Taiwan as stated in\nofficial documents (Exhs. III, V, and XI), Applicant shows no loyalty to Taiwan. He is a competent\nprofessional who expresses a knowledge of how to deal with any pressures that might be brought\nagainst him by or through an agent of a foreign government. Other official documents of the U.S.\nreflect a continuing need and desire for cooperation with Taiwan on a variety of social and\ntechnological fronts (Exh. II). \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nclearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l Guideline C: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n6\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nAfter full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case,\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness had resulted in part from circumstances beyond his control (injuries and\nunderemployment) and that he had made a good-faith effort to resolve his financial problems.1\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007).  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still owed approximately $15,000 on two\ncharged-off debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3,\n2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions.  She gave Applicant partial credit under the relevant mitigating conditions and\nfound in his favor as to four of the six SOR allegations.  However, she reasonably explained why the\nevidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\n\n3\nGiven the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision\nunder Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of financial irresponsibility resulting in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed\nin December 2003 and discharged on March 18, 2004.  He incurred several delinquent debts post-\nbankruptcy, including a $13,000 car loan that has been charged off.  Although Applicant entered into\na repayment agreement with one of his debtors, he has provided insufficient proof that he is making\na good faith effort to resolve the car loan debt, even though he still drives the car.  He has not\nmitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations. Clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Tr. at 6; Gov 1.\n2\n Tr. at 7; Gov 1; AE F at 10.\n3\n Gov 1\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn March 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued  Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement, dated April 9, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another\nadministrative judge on June 21, 2007. The case was transferred to me on August 2, 2007. On\nAugust 23, 2007, a notice of hearing was sent scheduling the hearing fro September 19, 2007. The\nhearing was held as scheduled. The government offered five exhibits which were admitted as\nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1-5 without objection. Applicant offered five exhibits which were\nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - E without objection. The record was held open until October\n3, 2007, in order to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted\na 10-page  additional document that was admitted as AE F without objection. On October 3, 2007,\nit was determined an issue remained pertaining to Applicant having all of the Government's\ndocuments. On that date, I mailed Gov 1-5 to Applicant and extended the deadline to submit post-\nhearing exhibits until October 26, 2007.  No additional or additional documents were submitted. The\ntranscript was received on October 1, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his SOR response, Applicant admits SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e, and denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c,\nand 1.f. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful\nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 36-year-old man employed with a Department of Defense contractor who is\napplying for a security clearance. He is single and has a seven-year-old daughter.  He has been\n2\nemployed with the same company for the past three years as a material coordinator.3\nOn January 11, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application, Standard Form\n86.

The bankruptcy was discharged on\n5\nMarch 18, 2004.  Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in order to get out of overwhelming debt.\n6\nHe had approximately $14,000 in delinquent debt at the time. His full-time job at the time did not\npay enough to allow him to get out of debt.  In 1992, he injured his back on the job. In 1994, he had\n7\nback surgery and was off work for approximately eight months. He was only paid two thirds of his\nsalary during the time he was off work which caused him to get behind in his bills.8\nA credit report, dated March 1, 2006, was obtained during Applicant's background\ninvestigation.  The credit report listed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy which was filed in December 2003\n9\nand discharged in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in April 2003 (SOR \u00b6\n1.b); a $13,528 automobile loan that was charged off in June 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $2,214 account\nthat was 120 days past due (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $365 collection account owed to a university credit union\nplaced for collection in January 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and a jewelry store account was listed as past due\nbut indicating a zero balance (SOR 1.f).10\nA credit report, dated March 1, 2007, listed the same accounts. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.c and 1.e were listed as charged off accounts. A $214 cell phone collection account was also\nlisted.11\nIn response to interrogatories, dated December 28, 2006, Applicant indicated that the $214\ncell phone account and the $365 university credit union account was included in his Chapter 7\nbankruptcy. Record evidence verifies the $214 cell phone account was included in his bankruptcy.12\nThe university credit union provided a letter verifying the $365 account was discharged in\nbankruptcy.  Applicant provided proof that the jewelry store (SOR \u00b6 1.f) account has been paid in\n13\nfull since April 2002.14\n\n AE A at 2-3. \n15\n Tr. at 58-60. \n16\n AE C and AE E. \n17\n Tr. at 52-53.\n18\n Tr. at 31, 36-51; Gov 2 at 2. \n19\n AE F at 5.\n20\n AE F at 7. \n21\n4\nApplicant denies filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in April 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  He provided\na letter from his bankruptcy attorney. The bankruptcy attorney confirms that Applicant filed for\nbankruptcy on only one occasion in December 2003.15\nIn late 2006, early 2007, Applicant attended two counseling sessions at his church on how\nto stay debt free and how to pay bills.  \n16\nOn September 13, 2007, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the creditor in\nSOR \u00b6 1.e.  The balance is approximately $1,547.  He agreed to pay $60 per month until the account\nis paid in full.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was a loan he took out in order to make a down payment for\n17\na car he purchased in February 2005. He defaulted on the loan a few months later.18\nThe $13,528 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the balance owed on an automobile loan for the car\nthat he purchased in February 2005. He made regular payments until July/August 2005. After that,\nhe made some sporadic payments towards the loan. His last payment was in August 2006.  He had\nmechanical problems with the car and tried to give the car back but the dealership would not let him\nreturn the car. He claims that he contacted the creditor to initiate plans to start making payments\nagain but they told him they were no longer taking payments from him. At the close of the record\nthe car had not been repossessed. Applicant still drove the car even though he was not making\npayments on the loan. He has had no contact with the lender for over a year.19\nAfter the hearing, Applicant consulted a friend who owns a tax service to draft a budget for\nhim. Applicant gets paid twice a month. A pay stub dated September 9, 2007, indicates that his take\nhome pay is $874.28.  His monthly take home pay would be approximately $1,748.56. The budget\n20\nlists his total monthly expenses as $1,612.09.  The budget does not include the automobile loan debt\n21\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. After expenses, Applicant has approximately $336.07 (Included in the budget\nwas a $200 deposit towards savings. I included the $200 in the amount of excess funds that he has\nleft over each month).\nApplicant has one open credit card account that has a total credit line of $450.  An  account\nsummary from the credit card company, dated September 19, 2007, indicates a balance of $671.97.\nA notation indicates that his account was past due $27.  The statement lists a minimum payment of\n$331.60. The statement indicates Applicant was charged a late payment charge of $35 on September\n\n AE F at 6. \n22\n AE F at 8-10. \n23\n Department of the Navy v.

It was noted that he\nconsistently meets expectations. His evaluator noted that Applicant is one of his more seasoned\nveteran receivers. He states that Applicant demonstrates complete job knowledge of the receiving\nprocess, has mentored new employees and has a good rapport with other departments.23\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n24\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.25\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n26\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n\n Id.\n27\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n28\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n30\n6\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n27\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n28\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.29\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n30\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nApplicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. He encountered financial problems\nover the past several years, accumulating approximately $14,000 in delinquent accounts which were\ndischarged in bankruptcy in March 2004.  After the bankruptcy, he continued to have difficulty\nmeeting his financial obligations.  Two loans related to the purchase of a car in February 2005 have\nbeen charged off, totaling approximately $15,075. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition\n(FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's case.  I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\n1.b because he did not file a second bankruptcy. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and\n1.f because SOR \u00b6 1.c was discharged in his bankruptcy and SOR \u00b6 1.f was resolved. Financial issues\nremain pertaining the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.\n\n7\nThe concern under Financial Considerations can be mitigated. Applicant  has a history of\nfinancial irresponsibility spanning several years. He still has financial problems. Therefore, I cannot\napply Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nApplicant continues to have difficulty meeting his financial obligations even after his bankruptcy\ndischarge in March 2004. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does\nnot apply.  Although Applicant states that he was only paid 2/3s of his income during the eight month\nperiod that he was off work after his back surgery, this occurred at least nine years prior to his\nbankruptcy.  I cannot conclude that there were recent conditions beyond Applicant's control which\ncontributed to his financial situation.  FC MC \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not\napply.  Applicant has received financial counseling and recently had a budget prepared for him. He\nrecently entered into a repayment plan with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  However, it is too soon to\ndetermine that he will be able to maintain the monthly payments. In addition, he has not made a\nsufficient effort to resolve the $13,000 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. It is unlikely that Applicant's\nfinancial situation will be resolved in the near future.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f.  It does not apply with\nrespect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.  Applicant has done nothing for over a year with respect to resolving\nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, even though he still has the car that he purchased with this loan. With\nrespect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, he entered into a payment plan on September 13, 2007, one\nweek prior to his hearing. Not enough time has passed to determine that he will follow through with\nhis repayment agreement. He has not demonstrated that he made a good-faith effort to resolve the\ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness. I considered Applicant's favorable performance report. However, he still struggles to meet\nhis financial obligations and has provided insufficient proof to mitigate the delinquent accounts in\n\n8\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esq.,  Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1980, and moved to the United\nStates in 1995 with her parents and her sister. They all became naturalized United States citizens in\n2003, and they all reside in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s husband is a U.S. born citizen. Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers, including her grandfather, both grandmothers, uncle, and cousin are citizens and residents\nof Taiwan. They do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, because Applicant has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that she can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted. \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n\n2\n(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), dated March 15, 2007, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. The SOR was based on Foreign\nInfluence (Guideline B) concerns.\nApplicant filed a notarized response, dated April 4, 2007, to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On June 20, 2007,  the case\nwas assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing, but on August 22, 2007, the case\nwas reassigned to this Administrative Judge. Pursuant to formal notice, dated October 4, 2007, a\nhearing was held on October 17, 2007, in San Jose, California.  \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits\n1-4) and no witnesses were called. Applicant  offered 1 documentary exhibit (Exhibit A) and offered\nher own testimony. The transcript was received on October 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive. The SOR contains nine allegations, 1.a., through\n1.i., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 27 years old. She is employed as a chemical engineer researcher, by a defense\ncontractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nsector.\nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1980. She moved  to the United States in 1995, with both\nof her parents and her sister, and she became  naturalized United States citizen in 2003.  \nApplicant is married to a United States born citizen, and they have no children. She received\na Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from a United States university in 2004.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father became naturalized United States citizens in 2003, and they\ncontinue to reside in the United States. Her mother was a financial manager of a company in Taiwan,\n\n3\nbut she stopped working in 1990. Her father was a colonel in the Taiwanese army; he has been\nretired since 1995. In 2003 or 2004, her parents started an auto import business in the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s sister is also a resident of the United States, and she has been a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen since 2003.  She is employed by a United States company. \nApplicant\u2019s fraternal grandmother, who is 82 years old, is a citizen and  resident of Taiwan.\nShe has never been employed outside the home. Applicant speaks with her by telephone three or four\ntimes a year, and she last saw her in 2004. \nApplicant\u2019s uncle is also a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He served in the Taiwanese\nmarines, and he retired as a colonel in 1997. Applicant has no regular contact with her uncle. \nApplicant\u2019s cousin is a citizen and  resident of Taiwan. She is studying to be a prosecutor and\neventually plans to become a judge. Applicant contacts her cousin online three or four times a year.\nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandparents also are citizens and residents of Taiwan. They are both\nlong retired, and Applicant contacts them three or four times a year. \nApplicant visited Taiwan annually from 1998 through 2003, with her sister to see her family\nthere.\nCurrent Status of Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\nSince Applicant has family members who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, and because\nTaiwan may be considered part of the PRC, it is important to consider the status of Taiwan and the\nPRC.\nTaiwan has an elected democratic government. It has the 17  largest economy that is a\nth\nleading producer of high-technology goods. It engages in industrial and economic espionage.\nProprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information to be\nacquired by their agents from foreign governments and businesses. There are 23 million Taiwanese\ncitizens. Their per capita income in 2005 was $15,000, cited by their president in a speech that he\npresented as economic progress under his administration. Although the United States now recognizes\nTaiwan as part of the PRC as \u201cone-China\u201d it continues to maintain strong unofficial relations with\nTaiwan.\nThe PRC, the most populous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an\nimportant trading partner of the United States. It is run by the Communist Party which controls all\naspects of the PRC government. It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.\nAlthough there has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the United States\nin the past. The PRC has an extremely large army, a sophisticated defense establishment, and space\ncapability. The PRC has launched satellites, has ballistic missiles, has nuclear arms, and nuclear\nbombs. Its diplomatic and military dispute with the Republic of China (Taiwan), foreshadows a\npossible military conflict, which the United States opposes as a resolution of the conflict. The PRC\nhas an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings; detention or incarceration\n\n4\nwithout notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; no right to a public,\nfair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of due process; restrictions on free speech, on\nreligious freedom, on freedom of travel, on freedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy - family,\nhome or correspondence. \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nOne approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services. This\nis believed to be the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States. It also tries to\nidentify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information, and sometimes\nis able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted three letters from individuals who know her in different positions in her\nprofessional capacity (Exhibit A). These letters all discussed Applicant in extremely positive terms\nas a hard working, conscientious and trustworthy individual.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\n\n5\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom she is bound by affection, influence or obligation,\nare not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record,\nthe Government has established an initial  reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence). \nAs stated above, I have considered the country involved in this case in making my decision.\nTaiwan, a country that may be considered part of the PRC, and which engages in industrial and\neconomic espionage, must be scrutinized in great detail. Applicant has family member who are\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan. The Taiwanese citizenship and residency of Applicant's family\ncreate the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nThe possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present\nevidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her. This\nApplicant has done.\n  The evidence of Applicant\u2019s family, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, comes within\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 7. (a) contact with foreign family members, who are citizens and\nresidents in a foreign country, if that contact creates heightened risk of foreign exploitation,  pressure\nor coercion. \nThe primary factors in mitigation that I have considered under both the Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) of the Directive and the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d include: Applicant\u2019s history since coming to\nthe United States in 1990 when she was 10 years old (living in the U.S. for 17 of her 27 years);\n\n6\nbecoming a U. S. citizen along with her mother, father and sister in 2003; receiving a Bachelor of\nScience degree in Chemical Engineering from a United States university in 2004; being married to\na United States born citizen; her devotion to her family in the United States; the three very positive\ncharacter letters entered into evidence on Applicant\u2019s behalf; and finally her strong feelings for the\nUnited States. \nBased on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence,  I have determined\nthat Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating\nCondition (MC) 8. (b) applies, there is no conflict of interest because Applicant has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that she can be expected to resolve any conflict\nof interest in favor of the U.S.\n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event\npressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, she would resist it and\nwould  report the incident to the proper authorities. \n \n        \nOn balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's evidence opposing\nher request for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

He chose to pursue his higher education and profession in the U.S. He destroyed his\nMexican passport when he learned it raised security issues.  His wife was born in Ukraine, educated\nin the U.S., met and married Applicant in the U.S., and intends to become a U.S. citizen.  Security\nconcerns based on foreign influence are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges\nsecurity concerns under B (Foreign Influence).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 30, 2007, admitted all the allegations except\none, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to an administrative judge on July 6, 2007, and\nreassigned to me on July 25, 2007, based on workload.  The case was heard as scheduled on August\n22, 2007.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 31, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old orbital analyst for a defense contractor involved in satellite\ndevelopment.  He is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Mexico, having been born in the U.S. of Mexican\nparents (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) S at 4).  He has never held a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors and colleagues uniformly described him as talented, honest, hard\nworking, and dedicated (AX E, J, T, X).  He completed formal training on protection of proprietary\ninformation (AX F), and he enjoys a reputation for careful adherence to company rules and protocols\nfor protecting proprietary and sensitive information (AX B, C, D).  He demonstrated his familiarity\nwith the protocols during his testimony (Tr. 31-33).  He has received awards for technical excellence\n(AX G), and was rated as \u201chighly effective\u201d in 2004, 2005, and 2006 (AX H). \nApplicant\u2019s father is a medical doctor and medical researcher.  He is a citizen of Mexico.\nHe received his medical degree in Mexico in 1971, was licensed to practice in the U.S. in 1974, and\nreturned to Mexico in 1977 (AX Q).  He is a department head at a government-operated medical\ninstitute in Mexico and a professor at a government-operated university in Mexico, but most of his\nincome comes from his private practice (Tr. 36-39).  Although the medical institute is a government\norganization, its members maintain academic and professional independence (AX P).  He frequently\ntravels to the U.S. to work on medical matters (Tr. 72).\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a homemaker and has never worked outside the home.  His brother is\na dual citizen of the U.S. and Mexico, working in Mexico as an engineer (Tr. 41). \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s parents own their home debt-free and enjoy a comfortable income,\nthey live modestly and avoid ostentatious displays of their economic status (Tr. 39-40).  None of his\nfamily members are active in politics (Tr. 40-41).\n\n4\nApplicant and his brother were born while their parents were living in the U.S., and they\nreturned to Mexico with their parents in 1977.  When Applicant was 18 years old, he went to the\nAmerican Consulate in Mexico and told them he was concerned about losing his U.S. citizenship.\nHe was assured he could retain his U.S. citizenship, and he renewed his U.S. passport (Tr. 56).  \nApplicant attended college in the U.S., graduating in May 2000 with degrees in aerospace\nengineering and electrical engineering (AX T).  He began working for a defense contractor in the\nU.S. after graduating from college, and he obtained a master\u2019s degree in engineering management\nwhile working full time (AX V; Tr. 27).\nApplicant obtained a Mexican passport in September 2002, for convenience and to avoid\npaying the foreign airport use tax when he visited his family in Mexico (GX 2 at 2; Tr. 55).  He\ndestroyed his Mexican passport in the presence of his facility security officer when he learned it\nraised security issues (GX 2 at 29).\nApplicant maintains email contact with his family and talks to them on the telephone about\nevery other week (Tr. 42).  His family has visited him twice in the U.S., on his college graduation\nand on his wedding day (Tr. 42).  He has visited Mexico about 12 times in the last seven years,\nmostly for family events (Tr. 43, 57; Answer to SOR).  He belongs to a recreational flying club that\nsometimes flies to Mexico to enjoy the beaches or the scenery, and a charitable flying club that flies\nmedical professionals and supplies to poor communities in Mexico (AX W; Tr. 57-58).\nApplicant testified at the hearing that he does not regard himself as a dual citizen, but as an\nAmerican (Tr. 56).  He testified he cannot envision returning to Mexico.  He appreciates the\nopportunity provided by the U.S. to attain success through his own efforts rather than family status\nor place of birth (Tr. 60-61).\nApplicant was married in June 2007 to a citizen of Ukraine residing in the U.S.  He met his\nspouse while she was in the U.S. on a student visa.  They dated for about a year before they were\nmarried.  Applicant sponsored her for status as a conditional U.S. permanent resident after they were\nmarried (Tr. 34).  She intends to relinquish her Ukrainian citizenship and become a U.S. citizen as\nsoon as she is eligible (Tr. 35; AX A).  She is a certified public accountant and works for a large\naccounting firm in the U.S. (Tr. 35).\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a professor at a \u201cconstruction university \u201cin Ukraine.  His\nmother-in-law previously was a department head within Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs,\nbut she now works for a private cell phone company (AX A; Tr. Tr. 46-47).  They both reside in\nKiev, the capital of Ukraine.  They have never been involved in military or intelligence activities\n(AX A at 2).\nApplicant has visited with his mother-in-law four times and his father-in-law twice.  On one\noccasion the four of them went on vacation to Hawaii, and on another they spent two weeks together\ntouring Europe.  His in-laws did not come to their wedding.  His mother-in-law visited shortly after\ntheir marriage and on his wife\u2019s graduation from college (Tr. 47-48).  His in-laws speak very\nrudimentary English, and he cannot speak or understand Ukrainian.  Applicant can speak some\nRussian, as do his in-laws, but they prefer to converse in Ukrainian (Tr. 49).  He has no email or\ntelephonic contact with them (Tr. 50).  Applicant\u2019s wife communicates by email with her parents,\ntelephones them once every one or two months, and visits them about once a year (AX A at 3).\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s wife has two older brothers in Ukraine, who are college graduates but are\nunemployed (AX A at 2).  His wife considers them \u201closers\u201d and has no contact with them (Tr. 80).\nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of relevant adjudicative facts about Ukraine (Tr. 13; GX 3-6; Hearing Exhibit\n(HX I). \nUkraine has a parliamentary-presidential type of government since becoming independent\nof the Soviet Union in 1991.  It is undergoing profound political and economic change as it moves\ntoward a market economy and multiparty democracy.  After the first free elections in December\n1991, presidential elections were marred by government intimidation and electoral fraud.  The\npresidential election in 2005 and local elections in March 2006 were markedly more fair.  Ukraine\nhas significant human rights problems. Torture, arbitrary detention of persons critical of the\ngovernment, and warrantless violations of privacy are illegal but common.  \nUkraine inherited a military force of 780,000 from the Soviet Union, which is seeking to\nmodernize.  Ukraine participates in six United Nation peacekeeping missions and has a small\nnumber of troops serving in supporting roles with Coalition forces in Iraq.   \nUkraine\u2019s foreign policy goals include membership in the World Trade Organization, the\nEuropean Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  Ukraine has peaceful and constructive\nrelations with its neighbors.  Relations with Russia are difficult and complex, however, due to\ndiffering foreign policy priorities in the region, energy dependence, payment arrears, disagreement\nover stationing of Russian military forces, and some boundary disputes.  \nEthnic Russians are concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine, constituting\nabout 17.3% of the population.  They are suspicious of Ukrainian nationalism and support close ties\nwith Russia.  However, Kiev, where Applicant\u2019s in-laws live, is in the northern part of Ukraine (GX\n3 at 1).\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, without objection from Department Counsel, I took administrative\nnotice of the following relevant adjudicative facts about Mexico.  Mexico is a federal republic.  It\nis a friendly neighbor of the U.S., with whom it shares extensive commercial, cultural, and\neducational ties.  Traditionally, Mexico has maintained its interests abroad and projected its\ninfluence through moral persuasion.  Its foreign relations are based on the principles of\nnonintervention and self-determination.  It does not target U.S. citizens to obtain military or\neconomic information, nor does it coerce its own citizens to obtain knowledge about the U.S.  To\nthe contrary, the U.S. and Mexico collaborate on security issues ranging from terrorism to drug\ntrafficking, as well as many other issues (AX O, R; Tr. 22-23).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\n\nSOR \u00b6 1.f initially alleged Applicant\u2019s father-in-law was a Department Head within Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of\n1\nEconomic Affairs.  At Department Counsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I amended the SOR to\nconform to the evidence by substituting \u201cmother-in-law\u201d for \u201cfather-in-law.\u201d  (Tr. 90-91.)\n6\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side\nof denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Ukraine living in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), her\nparents are citizens and residents of Ukraine (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and her mother was a department head in\nUkraine\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs (SOR \u00b6 1.f).   It also alleges his parents are citizens and\n1\nresidents of Mexico (SOR \u00b6 1.b), his father works for a government-run hospital in Mexico (SOR\n\u00b6 1.c), and his brother is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Mexico residing in Mexico (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\n\n7\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d AG \u00b6 6.\nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, a\ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Second, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a\nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Third, a\nsecurity concern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d).  All three disqualifying conditions are raised by\nthe evidence in this case.\nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically\ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient\nto require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nthe applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the applicant.  See Directive\u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 99-0424,\n2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  An applicant has the burden of proving a\nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR\nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\n\n8\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties\nto a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \nApplicant is clearly independent of his parents, but he enjoys a good familial relationship\nwith his parents and brother.  He is less close to his in-laws.  \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption\nthat a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's\nspouse.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).\nApplicant has rebutted that presumption for his two Ukrainian brothers-in-law, with whom he has\nno relationship.  He did not indicate any particular affection for his mother-in-law and father-in-law,\nbut he offered nothing to rebut the presumed ties of obligation to them.  Neither Applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family members nor his in-laws are engaged in military or intelligence activities, and they\ndo not work for businesses involved in economic espionage.  \nMexico is a friendly country with close ties to the U.S.  Ukraine also is a friendly country,\nstriving for acceptance by the U.S. and Europe.  Neither country targets the U.S. for military or\neconomic intelligence.  Although Ukraine\u2019s human rights record is spotty, neither country has a\nreputation for mistreating its citizens or citizens of other countries to obtain military or economic\nintelligence.  The nature of both country\u2019s governments, their human rights record, and  their\nrelationships with the U.S. are clearly not determinative.  Nevertheless, they are all relevant factors\nin determining whether either Mexico or Ukraine would risk damaging their relationship with the\nU.S. by exploiting or threatening their private citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray the\nU.S.  After considering Applicant\u2019s family ties to Mexico and Ukraine individually as well as in\ntotality, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant is close to his family in Mexico, and less close to his in-laws in Ukraine.\nHowever, he chose to be educated in the U.S., clearly regards himself as a citizen of the U.S., and\nsaw his professional future as in the U.S.  He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing.  I am\nsatisfied he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.  Accordingly, I conclude AG\n\u00b6 8(b) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). There is a rebuttable\npresumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.\nISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  Applicant has regular contact with his family\nmembers in Mexico, but virtually no direct contact with his in-laws in Ukraine.  Communication\nwith his Ukrainian in-laws is severely inhibited by a language barrier.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is\npartially established for his in-laws in Ukraine.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n9\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors were discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant was candid, sincere, and persuasive at the hearing.  He has chosen a life and\nprofession independent of his parents.  He has impressed his colleagues as well as supervisors with\nhis good character, hard work, and careful adherence to the protocols for protecting sensitive\ninformation.  His enthusiasm for his work and his affection for the U.S. were obvious during the\nhearing.  His spouse also appears to have broken from her past and is pursuing her future with him\nin the U.S.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, considering\nthe nature of the countries involved, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole\nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence.\nAccordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my findings as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline B\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On August 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 28, 2007.

The request and the\nattached source documents were included in the record as attachments. (I-VII) The\nfacts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 28, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f of the SOR.  He did not submit additional\n3\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born and\nraised in China, and emigrated to the U.S. in 1997. Applicant became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen on March 25, 2005. He submitted a security clearance application on November\n23, 2005.  \n4\nApplicant received a bachelor of science degree in computer science from a U.S.\nuniversity. After receiving his degree, he worked as a research associate for another\nuniversity. Currently, he is employed as an engineer for a contractor. He has been in his\ncurrent position since March 2000.5\nHe was married in China in 1991. His wife is a citizen of China, but resides in the\nU.S. with Applicant and their son, a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s mother, father, brothers,\nand mother-in-law are citizens and residents of China.6\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a professor at a university in China. The university is no\nlonger a state entity. His parents are retired. The company they retired from has no\n\nId.\n7\n3\nconnections with the government. None of his relatives have ever been employed by\nthe government.7\nApplicant has traveled to China at least six times since 1999. His latest trip was\nin August 2006 to visit his family. He has weekly contact with his mother and father and\nmonthly contact with his brothers.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. China (PRC) is an authoritarian\nstate whose power is centralized in the Chinese Communist Party. In foreign relations,\nChina and the U.S. have been rivals since the Cold War, with particular disagreement\non the status of Taiwan, and China has continued to resist what it considers to be\nsuperpower dominance by the U.S., despite improving economic relations. The United\nStates is a primary intelligence target of China because of the U.S. role as a global\nsuperpower; its substantial military, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim\nand Asia; its role as a developer of advanced technology that China requires for\neconomic growth; and the large number of Americans of Chinese ancestry, who are\nconsidered prime intelligence targets by the PRC. China uses legal and illegal means,\nincluding espionage, to obtain military related systems and technologies from the U.S.\nChina has a poor human rights record and its citizens lack freedom to peacefully\nexpress opposition to the political system or to freely change those in charge of the\ngovernment. There are many high profile cases involving monitoring, harassment,\ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense\nlawyers, many of whom were seeking to exercise their rights under the law. There is a\nlack of due process and new restrictions on lawyers that further limits the progress\ntoward the rule of law. There are right restrictions on freedom to practice religion and\nfreedom to travel. According to the U.S. State Department, the government of China\nengages in serious human rights abuses including, extrajudicial killings, torture, coerced\nconfessions of prisoners, and forced labor.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:      \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\n\n5\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associates with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 7(a), a Acontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion\u201d may create a security concern. Similarly under AG & 7(d) \u201csharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of China. His mother, father\nand two brothers are citizens and residents of China. Applicant and his wife have visited\ntheir family on numerous occasions since 1999. The latest trip was last year. China is a\ncountry whose human rights record is dismal and the potential for abuse is high.\nApplicant\u2019s familial relationship with citizens and residents of China creates a\nheightened risk of potential exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Applicant and his wife have\nbeen married since 1991 and have a child. Although his wife maintains her residency in\nthe U.S., she has emotional ties with her family in China. Applicant\u2019s family is in China.\nHe and his wife visit their family frequently. Applicant and his wife keep in touch with\ntheir family by telephone. Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen, however, there is a\nheightened risk due to his wife\u2019s status and his family ties to China. Unfortunately,\nChina is a country that causes concern in the area of potential exploitation and coercion\nwhich makes Applicant vulnerable. His contact with his family cannot be construed as\nminimal. This creates a potential conflict of interest. The evidence does not raise this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 8(b), it may be mitigating where Athere is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\nhas longstanding, close ties with his family. There is no record evidence to indicate\ndeep loyalty to the U.S. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n\n6\nEvidence that \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation\u201d is potentially mitigating under AG & 8(c). Applicant traveled to China\nnumerous times to visit his family. He also contacts them on a regular basis. I conclude\nthis potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nAfter a review of the remaining mitigating conditions, I find that none of them\napply in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2\u00a9, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born and raised in\nChina. He married his wife in 1991. She is living in the U.S. but is a citizen of China.\nApplicant received his undergraduate degree in computer science from an American\nuniversity in 1998. He became a naturalized citizen in 2005. He is married to a Chinese\ncitizen and all his family reside in China. He and his wife have close ties to their\nrelatives in China. They have traveled at least six times since 1999 to visit their family.\nThey communicate with them on a regular basis. The familial ties are close and the\npractices exercised by China create a heightened security risk. I am persuaded by the\ntotality of the evidence that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant Applicant a security clearance. In reaching my decision, I considered\nthe evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign\ninfluence.\n \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

BRESLIN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esq. Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has been an employee of a defense contractor for about twenty years.  He has a\nhistory of significant financial problems resulting in bankruptcies in 1991 and 1997, and he is\ncurrently unable to pay delinquent debts totaling more than $16,000.00.  Applicant provided no\ninformation demonstrating how his current financial problems arose.  He entered into a repayment\nagreement for some obligations shortly before the initiation of the action, but it is too soon to\ndetermine if the program will be successful.  He falsified his security clearance application by\nconcealing his delinquent debts.  Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising under the\nguidelines for financial considerations and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2005, Applicant submitted an SF 86, Security Clearance Application.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992) (the \u201cDirective\u201d), as amended; and the new\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\nby the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  On February 22, 2007, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns raised under the\nDirective, Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 18, 2007.  He elected to have the matter\ndecided without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\ndated May 21, 2007.  On May 23, 2007, Department Counsel mailed a complete copy of the FORM\nto Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  On June 29, 2007, Applicant received\nthe FORM.  He did not submit any additional materials within the specified 30-day period.  The case\nwas assigned to me on August 15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR, but added explanatory comments.\n(Item 2.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 59 years old.  (Item 4 at 1.)  He was married in 1976, and has five children.  (Id.\nat 2-3.)  In 1987, Applicant began working in his present position as a sheet metal worker for a\ndefense contractor.  (Id. at 2.)  \n\n3\nApplicant and his wife filed jointly for bankruptcy protection in March 1991.  (Item 9 at 1.)\nThe bankruptcy court issued a final decree discharging Applicant and his wife from all dischargeable\ndebts in January 22, 1993.  (Item 9 at 6.)  \nHe received a Secret security clearance in November 1994.  (Item 4 at 5.) \nHe again filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in December 1997.  (Item 10.)  His debts were\ndischarged in June 1998.  In a statement dated August 1999, Applicant indicated he filed for\nbankruptcy because of large medical bills resulting from multiple family illnesses.  (Item 5.)   \nApplicant and his wife divorced in March 2000.  (Item 4 at 2.)  The file contains no\ninformation about whether the divorce had an impact on Applicant\u2019s finances, other than court-\nordered child support.\nOn August 31, 2005, Applicant signed an SF 86, Security Clearance Application.  (Item 4\nat 6.)  In response to questions 33 and 34, Applicant denied having his wages garnished or filing for\nbankruptcy within the preceding seven years.  (Item 4 at 5.)  Answering question 38, he denied\nhaving any debts more than 180 days delinquent within the preceding seven years.  (Id. at 6.)\nSimilarly, in response to question 39, he denied that he then had any debts delinquent for more than\n90 days.  (Id.)  \nSecurity investigators obtained a credit bureau report dated October 26, 2005.  (Item 7.)  The\nreport indicated eight accounts that were seriously delinquent or in a collection status.  Investigators\nobtained a second credit bureau report dated January 26, 2007.  (Item 6.)  The report listed numerous\nunpaid accounts.  \nIn about November 2006, a court ordered Applicant\u2019s wages garnished in the amount of\n$186.00 every two weeks to pay child support.  (Item 2.)  \nIn about January 2007, Applicant obtained the assistance of a company providing debt\nresolution services.  (Item 8 at 19, 22.)  Under the debt repayment agreement, Applicant pays\n$218.00 each month to the company, which takes a monthly fee, then distributes the remainder\namong the listed creditors.  \nDOHA issued the SOR on February 22, 2007.  In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated\nthat all the creditors listed in the SOR, paragraphs 1.a through 1.k, inclusive, were included in the\nrepayment plan.  (Item 2.)  However, it appears that the current plan covers only the creditors listed\nin paragraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.k of the SOR.  \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988).  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n\n4\n(Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified\ninformation within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  Conditions that\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate\nsecurity concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed in the\nconclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 2.)  An\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  (Id.)  An administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \nInitially, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out in \u00b6 18\nof the new adjudicative guidelines:  \n\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under \u00b6 19(a), an\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under  \u00b6 19(c),\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns.  As noted above,\nApplicant had significant financial problems for many years and he is currently unable to pay or\nresolve some substantial delinquent debts.  I find the available evidence raises these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised\nunder this guideline.  Paragraph 20(a) may apply where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  The behavior in question\nis the non-payment of delinquent debts.  The financial obligations in question remain unresolved;\ntherefore, I find the behavior is recent.  It also appears there were several unpaid debts that\naccumulated over a period of time; thus, I cannot find this was an infrequent event.  Finally,\nApplicant provided no information about the origin of his current delinquent debts.  He has failed\nto demonstrate they are unlikely to recur.  The available evidence does not raise this potentially\nmitigating condition.\nUnder \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The available information does not raise this condition.\nThere is no evidence Applicant was unemployed, nor does he suggest that his 2000 divorce caused\nfinancial problems.  Although medical bills caused or contributed to his bankruptcy in 1997, there\nis no evidence they were a factor in his current financial problems.  Applicant offered no statement\nor other information shedding any light on his personal circumstances, therefore I am unable to find\nthat this potentially mitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d is potentially mitigating\nunder \u00b6 20(c).  Similarly, \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Applicant submitted documents\nshowing he entered into a debt repayment agreement for five of the twelve debts listed in the SOR\n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.k) and made one payment toward the agreement.  It is too early to\ndetermine that these debts are resolved or under control. The evidence does not raise this potentially\nmitigating condition.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n\n6\nThe security concern relating to Guideline E, Personal Conduct, is set out in \u00b6 15 of the new\nadjudicative guidelines:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process. \nParagraph 16(a) provides that it may be disqualifying where the evidence reveals \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire\n. . . or similar form used to . . . determine security clearance eligibility . . . .\u201d  The SOR raises several\nallegations of Applicant\u2019s falsification of his Security Clearance Application.\nParagraph 2.a of the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his response to question 34, when he\ndenied having his wages garnished within the preceding seven years.  The government asserts\nApplicant deliberately concealed the wage garnishment described in \u00b6 1.l of the SOR, which\nApplicant admitted.  However, it appears the Security Clearance Application was executed in August\nof 2005, and the garnishment was imposed in November 2006.  Although Applicant seems to admit\nthis allegation, he cannot be said to falsely omit or conceal a garnishment not then in existence.\nParagraph 2.b of the SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his response to question\n38 by denying he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts within the preceding seven years.\nThe SOR lists the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, as being wrongfully omitted from the\nclearance application.  Unfortunately, some of these debts were first reported in the 2007 credit\nbureau report; several of them did not exist at the time of the clearance application.  Comparing the\ndebts alleged in \u00b6 2.b against the debts over 180 days delinquent in the credit bureau report dated\nOctober 2005, it appears the debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k should have been reported.\nFurther complicating matters, in his answer to the SOR, Applicant wrote, \u201cI admit\u2013over 7 years.\u201d\nIt is not clear what he meant by that response; perhaps he believed that if the original debt was\nincurred more than seven years before the application, it did not need to be reported.  If that is his\nassertion, it is not persuasive.  First, the question is straight forward and uncomplicated, and clearly\nrequires reporting of any debt delinquent within the seven year period.  More significantly, only one\nof the five debts that should have been reported (\u00b6 1.k) was incurred more than seven years before\nApplicant completed the application.  Considering Applicant\u2019s financial history (including his\nprevious bankruptcies), the number of unpaid debts, and their recency, I am not persuaded Applicant\nforgot or overlooked these debts.  \nParagraph 2.c of the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his response to question 39 by denying\nthat he had any debts then over 90 days delinquent.  Unfortunately, the SOR again alleges Applicant\nfailed to report ceratin debts, including some that did not arise until after he executed the clearance\napplication.  Nonetheless, there were some delinquent debts at the time Applicant signed the\nclearance application.  In his answer, Applicant wrote, \u201cI admit\u2013unaware.\u201d  However, considering\nApplicant\u2019s financial history (including his previous bankruptcies), the number of unpaid debts, and\ntheir recency, I am not persuaded Applicant forgot or overlooked these debts.  \n\n7\nParagraph 2.d of the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application by\nfailing to disclose that he had filed for bankruptcy within the preceding seven years.  In his Answer\nto the SOR, Applicant wrote, \u201cI admit\u2013over 7 years,\u201d seeming to indicate he did not report the\nbankruptcy because it was filed over seven years before he executed the application.  It appears\nApplicant filed a petition for bankruptcy in December 1997\u2013more than seven years before he signed\nthe Security Clearance Application in August of 2005.  I find Applicant did not falsify his answer\nto question 33.\nWhole Person Concept\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case\nin light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of\nnational security.  I considered the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct.  The available\nevidence shows Applicant has a history of significant financial problems.  Although he has been\ndischarged in bankruptcy twice\u2013most recently in 1998\u2013he again amassed unpaid debts.

She had four\nalleged debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR) totaling approximately $38,000. She paid\nalmost $18,000 in the recent past. She has a repayment plan for the remaining two debts. Her debt\nproblems resulted from separation and divorce. For the last two years she has shown her financial\nresponsibility by not generating any new delinquent debt. Applicant has mitigated security concerns\narising under financial considerations. Clearance is granted. \n\nApplicant's response to the SOR, dated January 10, 2007.\n1\n Government Ex. 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated January 30, 2006 ) at 1-13; \n2\nId. at 2.\n3\nTr. 14.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On December 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nSOR on January 10, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on February 16, 2007. Originally, the case was scheduled for March 8, 2007,\nbut Applicant requested a postponement to arrange for legal representation. After agreement with\nboth counsel, I scheduled a hearing for May 9, 2007. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on May 9, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Three\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-3) were admitted without objection.  Applicant's nine exhibits (AE A-I)\nwere admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified in her own behalf, as reflected\nin the hearing transcript (Tr.) received on May 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, \u00b6 1.a through 1.d are incorporated\nherein.  In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the evidence and exhibits, I make the\n1\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old community planner and cultural resources manager working for\na defense contractor. She served in the U.S. military from 1974 to 1977. She is twice divorced, and\nhas two grown children.  She held a security clearance from 1976 to 2000 without incident.\n2\nApplicant graduated from college in 2000.  She is currently working on her master's degree.\n3\n4\nApplicant has been employed with her current employer since 2002.\nEarly in her second marriage, she and her husband incurred debt, which continued over a\nperiod of 13 years. During the marriage, Applicant and her husband both worked. However, her\nhusband would insist that various purchases be made and should be charged to his wife's credit card.\n\nTr. 52.\n5\nAE B (Separation Agreement, dated 2003); Tr. 16.\n6\nTr. 22.\n7\nTr. 47.\n8\nId.; Initially Applicant disputed the accounts under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but at the hearing she decided\n9\nto retract the action.\n Response to SOR, supra, note 3 at 1.\n10\n Id.\n11\nTr. 60.\n12\nAE C and D (Death Certificates).\n13\nTr. 23.\n14\n4\nApplicant and her husband argued over the way finances were handled. She was upset when he was\nnot responsive to her requests to address the debts that were mounting.  He refused to pay anything\ntoward the marital debt.  She explained that they could not continue in this manner. The relationship\n5\nwas strained and very emotional. They separated in June 2003 ,and the divorce was final in October\n2003.\nThe separation agreement held Applicant liable for the marital debts.   She agreed to accept\n6\nall the debt in order to get divorced. Applicant's husband remained in the marital home, and\nApplicant had to find a new residence. As a result, Applicant could not meet all her financial\nobligations. She prioritized things and paid the expenses associated with the divorce and relocation.\nShe bought a modest town home for $117,000. Also, her son needed help financially at the same\ntime. She paid for necessities, but made a choice to defer four credit accounts.  She did contact the\n7\ncredit agencies to resolve the issues but never received a phone call in return.  She acknowledged\n8\nthat it was a difficult time to make decisions. However, she was determined to repay the debts.9\nIn 2003, finances became a problem. A credit card debt worth approximately $12,190,\nbecame delinquent and was charged off as a bad debt. Another credit card account for $6,316.33,\nwas also charged off. Her Visa, worth approximately $15,989, was charged off.   A credit card debt\n10\nto another account in the amount of $13,828, was charged off as a bad debt.  Applicant made no\n11\npayments on these accounts after 2003.  \n12\nIn November 2005, Applicant's brother died unexpectedly. A little more than one month later,\nher second brother died.  When her two brothers, who lived out of state, died suddenly, she had to\n13\nhire an attorney to close their estates. She is the executor of the will for one brother and the other\nbrother had no will. Thus, she also incurred more debt as a result of the up front expenses concerning\nfunerals and settlement of the estates. She is still in the process of administering the estates.14\n\nTr. 23-24.\n15\nTr. 58.\n16\nTr. 72.\n17\nGovernment Ex. 2 (Credit Bureau Report, dated March 2, 2006) at 1-9.\n18\nGovernment Ex. 3 (Credit Bureau Report, dated November 29,2006 )at 1-3.\n19\n5\nMoreover, Applicant's tax es increased due to assets that were included from her brothers' estates.\nShe used her entire savings to pay a tax bill.  She does have an IRA account.\n15\nIn April 2007, Applicant paid two large accounts for a total of $18,000. Applicant has\ndecided to handle the other two accounts one at a time. She wants to pay or settle the entire amount\nin one payment. She was insistent that she did not want to promise more than she could actually pay\noff to her creditors. Her goal is to pay them by the end of the year.  She owes approximately $19,000\n16\nto the remaining two creditors. The amount could be less if a settlement offer is accepted.17\nApplicant is a professional with many years of unblemished employment. She held a security\nclearance for many years without incident.\nApplicant earns approximately $3,600 net a month.  Today, Applicant lives within her\n18\nmeans and has not acquired any significant debt other than her home mortgage.  She is current on\n19\nher mortgage and she does not have a car loan. She is financially stable. She has a net monthly\nremainder. She has improved her credit rating. She will have more resources when her brothers'\nestates are finally settled. She accepts responsibility for paying her debts.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth set forth both disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n20\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n21\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n22\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n23\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

The government\n20\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n21\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n22\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n23\ndecision.24\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n25\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n26\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n27\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n28\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised AG most pertinent to the evaluation\nof the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.29\n\n7\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued four\ndelinquent debts over the years. Her credit report confirms the debts, and Applicant admits there are\nstill two outstanding debts.  Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC\nDC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC, AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. Several incidents occurred\nin Applicant' s life over which she had little or no control. Her separation and divorce, combined with\nher husband's irresponsibility with credit card debt contributed to Applicant's acquisition of\ndelinquent debt. She agreed to accept all the debt in order to get divorced. She paid on the credit\naccounts until 2003 but then decided to prioritize. The deaths of her two brothers in 2005\ncompounded her situation. Therefore, FC MC , AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) applies. \nApplicant was open and honest during her security application process. The delinquent debt\noccurred during her second marriage. She has not accumulated any other frivolous debt. She has\nincreased her credit score. She has maintained a security clearance for many years without incident.\nTherefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC), \u00b6 AG 20(a), (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) applies.\nApplicant did not receive financial counseling. However, she has paid more than half the\ndelinquent debt, albeit recently. FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control) does apply to some extent.\nIn the past years, Applicant did not have sufficient income to pay the entire four delinquent\ncredit accounts. Granted, she was employed but she still decided it was financially sound to make\nlump payment sums. In 2007, she began paying her debts. This good-faith effort will continue.\nTherefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) applies to a degree.\nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her\noutstanding debts, but whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security clearance decision. Her remaining unpaid debt\ndoes not constitute a security risk. In 2007, she began repayment of her delinquent debt and will have\nsufficient resources to pay her last two debts this year. She has a professional position with a good\nincome and stands ready to proceed.\nWhole Person Analysis\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. She\nis an earnest, mature woman who served her country. She maintained a security clearance for many\n\n8\nyears without adverse incident. She is currently in a professional position in the defense contractor\nindustry. Her testimony at the hearing was candid and straightforward. At the hearing she\nacknowledged the financial delinquencies would be considered a negative. She is open, honest and\nhas not hidden the situation. She believes this is a reasonable way to resolve the debts. She has not\nincurred any other delinquent debt in two years. Her financial circumstances have improved. The\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low. She is current on her financial\nobligations, and has a very positive employment history. A greater awareness of financial\nresponsibilities will result in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is low. Applicant's financial case shows her\nwillingness to utilize her resources. I conclude she has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to\nfinancial considerations. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):       FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.       \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.      \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.       \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nNoreen A. Lynch.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on April 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked directly or\nindirectly for the U.S. Government since about 1992. Applicant was born in Switzerland. She came\nto the U.S. in 1984, and became a U.S. citizen in 1995. She attended college in Switzerland, and has\na master\u2019s degree from an American university. Applicant is divorced from a U.S. citizen. She has\ntwo children who are dual U.S. and Swiss citizens.   \n2\nApplicant maintained dual citizenship with Switzerland after becoming a U.S. citizen. She\nexercised her Swiss citizenship by obtaining a Swiss passport in 2004, which will not expire until\n2014. She still possesses the Swiss passport. Applicant has traveled extensively since becoming a\nU.S. citizen. She has always used her U.S. passport, except when entering and exiting Switzerland,\nwhich requires its citizens to use their Swiss passport.  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s reason for obtaining and maintaining the Swiss passport is to ease her entry to\nSwitzerland if there is an emergency related to her parents. Her parents are citizens and residents of\n\nTr. at 20-25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1 at 23.\n4\nTr. at 17, 35-36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A.\n5\nTr. at 33.\n6\nGE 1 at 28.\n7\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n8\nId. at 527.\n9\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n10\n4\nSwitzerland. Her father is 77 years old, and has heart problems. Her mother is 72, and had knee\nsurgery. Applicant expressed a willingness to renounce her Swiss citizenship, but not until her\nparents are deceased. U.S. citizens can travel to Switzerland for 90 days on a tourist visa. In order\nto stay longer, some type of extension is required. Applicant wants to maintain the ability to stay\nlonger if necessary.  \n4\nApplicant\u2019s mother maintained a savings account in Switzerland on Applicant\u2019s behalf since\nApplicant was a child. As of December 2006, the balance in the account was approximately $356,\nin U.S. currency. Applicant was unaware of this account until she contacted her mother in December\n2006, in order to obtain information to respond to DOHA interrogatories. Her mother informed her\nat that time about the savings account. The account has since been closed. Applicant currently has\nno foreign assets. She owns her home in the United States and has other U.S. assets.5\nApplicant was interviewed pursuant to a background investigation in 2005. She told the\ninvestigator that she did not have any financial interests in Switzerland.  Applicant believed the\n6\nstatement was true because she was unaware of the Swiss savings account at that time.\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), on\nMay 23, 2006. She responded \u201cNo\u201d to Question 17a, which asked, \u201c[d]o you have any foreign\nproperty, business connections, or financial interests?\u201d  Applicant\u2019s answer was truthful to the best\n7\nof her knowledge because she was unaware of the Swiss savings account when the eQIP was\nsubmitted.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n8\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n9\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n10\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n11\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n12\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n13\n5\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n11\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n12\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n13\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. This raises a security concern under the foreign\npreference guideline.\nBased on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a)\n(exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession\nof a current foreign passport), applies in this case. \nI have considered all the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC), and I especially\nconsidered FP MC 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry) and FP MC 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship).\nApplicant actively exercised her dual citizenship by obtaining and using a Swiss passport after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen. I do not find FP MC 11(a) totally applicable. Applicant has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship, but only after her parents pass away. That is insufficient\nto totally invoke FP MC 11(b). \n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nAs discussed above, Applicant provided what she thought were truthful answers to the\ninvestigator and on the e-QIP. No Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant is an obviously intelligent, professional woman. She has a good job, with a stable\nemployment record. She has provided valuable service to the United States Government. Her\ntestimony was sincere and forthright. Her reasons for maintaining dual citizenship and a Swiss\npassport stem from her concern for her parents. I also considered that the country at issue is\nSwitzerland. Nonetheless, security concerns persist based upon Applicant\u2019s possession and use of\na valid current foreign passport.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security\nconcerns, but has not mitigated the security concerns based on her foreign preference.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Shoemaker, Jr., Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 44 years old and has worked for his current employer for 25 years. Over the\ncourse of the last twenty years, he has been arrested and charged with criminal conduct five\ntimes, four of which involved alcohol, the most recent being in July 2005. He was also charged\nwith possessing marijuana at the time of that arrest. He remains on criminal probation until\nDecember 2007. When he completed his security clearance application in November 2005, he\nintentionally failed to disclose the marijuana charge. He failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct,\nAlcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct security concerns. He mitigated the Drug\nInvolvement security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n On November 22, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).  On March 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as\namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended,\nmodified and revised.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal\n1\nConduct), G (Alcohol Consumption), H (Drug Involvement), and E (Personal Conduct). The\nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer notarized on April 2, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On April 18, 2007, the case was assigned to me. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on May 15, 2007, setting the hearing for June 6, 2007. At the\nhearing, the Government introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 into evidence.\nApplicant testified and called two witnesses.  He introduced two exhibits that were marked and\nadmitted as Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B without objection.  The record was left open until\nJune 18, 2007, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional exhibits.  On June 13, 2007,\nApplicant submitted an exhibit that I marked AX C and admitted without objection by\nDepartment Counsel. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2007.   \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\n\nPrior to the commencement of the Government's case, Department Counsel indicated that\nhe did not intend to produce evidence in support of the allegation contained in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which\nApplicant denied. That allegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 44 years old. He has been married for 16 years.  He has one child and one\nstepchild. He has been employed as a sheet metal mechanic with his current employer for 25\nyears. He refuels a U.S. Naval carrier. (Tr. 25). He has held a security clearance since 1983.  He\nis subject to random drug testing as a condition of his job. (Tr. 26).  His last test, in the fall of\n2005, was negative. (Tr. 26).\nApplicant has been arrested four times for charges related to alcohol consumption. In\nSeptember and November 1988, he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol (DUI). As a result he was ordered to attend alcohol counseling classes. In September\n1992, he was again arrested and charged with DUI. He attended inpatient treatment for one\nmonth and subsequently attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for one year. (Tr. 52-53). He\nalso lost his driver\u2019s license for seven years and had to find alternate means of transportation to\nget to work. (Tr. 43). He stopped attending AA because he believed he had the problem \u201cunder\ncontrol.\u201d (Tr. 53).\nApplicant essentially maintained sobriety from 1992 until 2005. During that time, he\ndrank on about five occasions, once when his father died in 1997. (Tr. 29; 45). \nIn July 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with Misdemeanor DUI and\nMisdemeanor Possession of Marijuana-First Offense.  He was found guilty of the DUI and\nsentenced to 60 days incarceration, suspended, fined $350, and ordered to pay $66 in court cost.\nHe was placed on unsupervised probation for two years. His driver\u2019s license was restricted for\none year and he was only permitted to drive to work or AA. (Tr. 44). He was also ordered to\nattend an alcohol-counseling program for 16 weeks. He successfully completed the alcohol\nsafety action program in December 2006, but remains on criminal probation until December\n2007. (AX C). He tries to attend AA once a week and estimates that he has gone at least 50 times\nover the last year. (Tr. 58). He does not have a sponsor, despite recognizing that it would be a\ngood idea. (Tr. 59). He goes to church regularly. (Tr. 47-48). The marijuana charge was nolle\nprossed.\nPrior to this arrest, Applicant and his wife became embroiled in a serious argument that\narose from the accumulated stress of caring for his 44-year-old developmentally disabled sister-\nin-law, who has lived with them since 2004. (Tr. 31).  After he left the house, he went to a local\nbar and \u201cwent on a drinking binge.\u201d (Tr. 32). While at the bar, one of the other patrons gave him\nsome marijuana. He did not purchase it. (Tr. 42).  On his way to his sister\u2019s home that night, he\nwas stopped by the police for erratic driving, at which time the police discovered the marijuana.\n\nHe did not use the marijuana, but intended to. (Tr. 31-34; 39; 60).  He has not used alcohol since\nthat night, and has no intention of every using drugs or alcohol again. (Tr. 35).  He knows he did\nnot handle the situation with his wife very well. (Tr. 31).\n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana in the 1980\u2019s and once in 1992 after he had an\nargument with his wife. The last time he used it was in 1997 when his dad died.  (Tr. 28). He\nacknowledged using it after obtaining a security clearance in 1983. (Tr. 39).\nAlthough Applicant disclosed his alcohol arrests in the SF 86, he did not list the 2005\nmarijuana charge on his SF 86.  He admitted that he intentionally omitted it because he was very\nembarrassed and ashamed of his conduct. He knew the information would be discovered. (Tr.\n48-49; 61).  He is very \u201csorry for not telling the truth.\u201d (Tr. 37).  He understands that future use\nof alcohol or drugs could adversely affect his job and family. (Tr. 38). He disclosed his problem\nto his supervisor, wife and stepson. (Tr. 61).  In his answer, he admitted the allegations contained\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4. b pertaining to the falsification of the SF 86.\n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified.  She does not allow alcohol in their home. She is aware of her\nhusband\u2019s alcohol problem.  To the best of her knowledge, he has not consumed alcohol since\nthe 2005 arrest. He is a very good husband and father.  He has been very helpful with her sister\nsince she moved in.  She was unaware that her husband ever used marijuana in the past. (Tr. 77).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified. He has a security clearance. He has known Applicant\nsince 1982 and has supervised him for about eight to ten years. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s\nprevious marijuana use and current problems. (Tr. 68). He considers Applicant to be a very\nreliable employee. (Tr. 65). He has no reason to believe Applicant poses a national security risk,\nas there have not been any complaints of him mishandling confidential or classified information\nover the years. (Tr. 69). \n \nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must\nconsider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified\nInformation\u201d (Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the\nadjudicative Guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6\n2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to\n2\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.\nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area\nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n3\nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s]\nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2\n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nnational security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n2\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the\nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides,\n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and\n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends\nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special\nrelationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision\nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express\nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order\n10865, \u00a7 7. \n\nSee generally, e.g. ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (Although the passage of three years since\n19\nApplicant\u2019s last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel the Judge to apply CC MC 1, as a matter of law, the\nJudge erred by failing to give an explanation why he did not apply that mitigating condition.). \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the\nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning criminal\nconduct stating, \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nBased on the evidence, the Government raised a security concern under three\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d an \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d and the \u201cindividual\nis currently on parole or probation.\u201d Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c), and (d).  Applicant was\narrested and convicted of five criminal charges, and arrested for possession of\nmarijuana, which was not prosecuted. He is currently on probation until December\n2007. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying conditions, and\nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Two Criminal\nConduct M itigating Conditions are potentially applicable under Guideline \u00b6 32 and the facts of this\nparticular case:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when a crime is \u201crecent.\u201d  If\n11\nthe evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of\nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of\ntime demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding\nof reform or rehabilitation.\u201d Id. Applicant\u2019s last SOR-alleged criminal conduct was\nin July, 2005, approximately two years before his hearing. This serious misconduct\nis too recent to merit application of Guideline \u00b6 32(a), given his previous history of\nalcohol problems.  Additionally, the circumstances leading to his alcohol\nconsumption related to on-going family stresses, which cannot be considered to be\nentirely out of the ordinary or unusual as contemplated under this condition.\n\nGuideline \u00b6 32(d) has limited application as there is some evidence of successful\nrehabilitation. Applicant paid his fine, successfully completed the alcohol counseling classes in\nDecember 2006, periodically attends AA, and has a good employment record.  However, he remains\non probation, and hence is unable to demonstrate successful rehabilitation until he is completes that\nterm and is released from the court system. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nGuideline \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol\nconsumption: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Government raised a security concern under this Guideline.  Applicant\nhas been arrested and charged four times for incidents that were related to alcohol\nconsumption: twice in 1988, once in 1992, and once in 2005.  Those charges\nestablished a disqualification under Guideline \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse\nabuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nAfter reviewing all four of the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions\nunder this Guideline, I conclude Guideline \u00b6 23(b) provides some mitigation. It is\napplicable when \u201can individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).\u201d Applicant acknowledged that he has had an alcohol problem for\nsome time and has received treatment for it in 1992 and 2005. Over the last year, he\nthinks he has attended AA about 50 times although he has not obtained a sponsor,\nnormally an integral part of the recovery program. Although he has not consumed\nalcohol in two years, that length of sobriety is not sufficient to establish a pattern of\nabstinence required under this condition, given his recent serious relapse after 13\nyears.  \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\nGuideline \u00b6 24 sets forth the Government\u2019s concern about drug involvement:\n\u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  \nThe Government raised a disqualification under Guideline \u00b6 25(c): \u201cillegal\ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d Based on his admission that he\nused it while holding a security clearance, the Government also established a case\nunder Guideline \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance.\u201d\n\n Applicant admitted in his answer and during his testimony that he previously\nused marijuana and possessed it at the time of his arrest in July 2005, intending to\nuse it.  He vigorously stated that he has no intention of ever using it again, realizing\nthe problems it has created for him and his employment situation. That assertion,\nalong with his tremendous embarrassment over the situation, is sufficient to trigger\nthe application of the mitigating condition set forth in Guideline \u00b6 26(b): \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d\nI do not believe he will\nuse it again.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 15 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about personal conduct:\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d\nBased on Applicant\u2019s candid admissions that he intentionally withheld\ninformation from his e-QIP, the Government established a Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition under Guideline \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nI reviewed the seven Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions, and conclude\ntwo of them provide some mitigation. (1) Guideline \u00b6 17(d) is applicable when \u201cthe\nindividual has acknowledged the behaviour and obtained counselling to change the\nbehaviour or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behaviour, and\nsuch behaviour is unlikely to recur.\u201d In this case, Applicant\u2019s sincere\nacknowledgement of his wrongful conduct is noteworthy. However, he did not\npresent evidence of counselling for the underlying behaviour that lead to the\nmisrepresentation or of other positive steps taken to alleviate the stressor or factors\ncausing the problem, which is necessary to support the entire application of the\ncondition. (2) He disclosed his wrongful conduct to his wife and supervisor,\nindicating that he \u201chas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d  and warranting the application of Guideline\n\u00b6 17(e).  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have\nconsidered the general adjudicative Guideline related to the whole person concept\nunder Guideline \u00b6 2(a). As noted above, Applicant\u2019s 2005 arrest and subsequent\nfalsification of his SF 86 are sufficiently serious to raise a security concern. His\nactions were knowledgeable and voluntary. His crime occurred in July 2005 and he\nremains on probation. He is 44 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible\nfor his conduct. The motivation for his criminal offense was the culmination of\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006). \n11\nstress related to his family situation and the reason for the falsification related to his\nunderlying embarrassment and disappointment with himself. His conduct in both\nsituations was not prudent or responsible.  These offenses \u201ccreate doubt about [his]\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, [and] call into question [his] ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\n \nApplicant presented some mitigating evidence, but not enough to mitigate all of\nthe disqualifying conditions. He was extremely forthright and remorseful during his\ntestimony about his alcohol problems and his shame over his drug involvement and\nfailure to tell the truth about it.  He is hard-working and dedicated to his job and\nemployer.  He appears to be a good family man, and has obviously assumed a\ntremendous burden in caring for his disabled sister-in-law.  All of those facts attenuate\nthe SOR allegations.\nHowever, they are not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised, in\nparticular, by his alcohol relapse and falsification. Although Applicant did not\nexperience any alcohol related incidents for about 13 years, his relapse in 2005 was\nsignificant. Not only did he attempt to drive while inebriated, but he was willing to\nsmoke marijuana after a long hiatus. Clearly, his alcohol problems are not minor and\npotentially dangerous.  Although he participated in treatment in 1992 and attended AA\nfor one year, he stopped because he thought the problem was \u201cunder control.\u201d \nWhile I believe Applicant is committed to sobriety, I find that he has not\npresented sufficient independent evidence of participation in a recovery program at\nthis time to support his assertion that he will never drink again.  Until he documents a\npattern of solid ongoing participation in a program and addresses the stressors at home\nthat triggered his relapse (possibly with professional assistance), I am concerned that\nhe may backslide again.  I also believe that as he continues with his recovery work, the\nlikelihood that the falsification conduct would recur is minimal. Unfortunately, his\nrehabilitative efforts to-date have not sufficiently removed my doubts about his good\njudgment, as related to the concerns raised under Guidelines G and E.  Until he is\nreleased from criminal probation, the security concerns raised under Guideline J\nremain.  He has however, mitigated those raised under Guideline H.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11\nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the\nGuidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\n          For Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n      Subparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\n      Subparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n          \n      Subparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n \n      Subparagraph 4.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n                          Subparagraph 4.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: William F. Savarino, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was denied a security clearance in 1989 after expressing his belief in\nthe validity of terrorism as a tool in fighting oppression, and admitting to disclosure of\nclassified information to a foreign-national prostitute while serving in military intelligence\nduties. His recent statements concerning both issues support ongoing concerns about\nhis judgment and willingness to comply with security rules and regulations. Based upon\na thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86), on May 8, 2004.\nOn May 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nE. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\nApril 6, 2009\n\n2\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 30, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 10, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 6, 2008, and DOHA\nassigned the case to another administrative judge on August 12, 2008. Due to caseload\nand scheduling considerations, DOHA reassigned the case to me on October 30, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 2, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on January 8, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf, as did one other witness, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B,\nwhich were also admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the\nrecord open until January 22, 2009, to permit Applicant to obtain and submit additional\ndocuments. This evidence was submitted on that date, and admitted as AE C without\nobjection by Department Counsel. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nFebruary 5, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor six years in management on an overseas facility operation support contract.  He has\nnever married, and has no children. In his response to the SOR (AR), he admitted that\nhe was denied a security clearance in 1989, but denied the other three SOR allegations.\nIn December 1980, after completing three and a half years of college, Applicant\nenlisted in the Army. He served in signals intelligence duties for about seven and a half\nyears, and was honorably discharged in 1988. During his service, he held a Top Secret\nsecurity clearance. He was then hired by a defense contractor and applied for a security\nclearance through them. He failed a polygraph examination administered as part of the\nrequired background investigation multiple times. In discussing possible reasons for\nappearing deceptive, Applicant revealed his terrorism beliefs and unauthorized\ndisclosure of classified material, discussed further below. As a result, in November 1989\nthe Government denied his security clearance. (SF-86 at 1, 3, 5; Tr. at 28-34; 60-61.)\nApplicant then obtained a job with a different company that was performing\nmilitary support services in Saudi Arabia. He received an interim U.S. security\nclearance, but after about four months the company pulled out of the contract and left\nSaudi Arabia. It also cancelled its sponsorship for security clearance applications for its\nformer employees there. Applicant was then hired to work directly for the Saudi Arabian\nMinistry of Defense, and worked for that government from December 1990 until his\ncontract was terminated in September 1996. He remained a direct employee of the\nSaudi military even after another U.S. contractor returned and offered employment\n\u201cbecause the money was better.\u201d During that time, he held a security clearance from the\nSaudi government. (SF-86 at 4; Tr. at 61-69.)\n\n3\nApplicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninvestigator in connection with his current security clearance application, and signed a\nsworn affidavit addressing several issues of potential concern on November 2, 2007\n(GE 2). In that affidavit, he discussed why he thought he had failed the security\npolygraph examination, including \u201cmy belief in the use of terrorism that may have\ntriggered a deceptive reading.\u201d (GE 2 at 5.) The interviewer originally wrote that\nApplicant said: \nI support the Irish Republican Army\u2019s (IRA) policies and ideologies of\nterrorism against the British Government. I do not think Britain should be\nruling Ireland. I still think terrorism is a valid tool. I\u2019ve never made\ndonations to the IRA or any other terrorist organization. I do not believe in\nterrorism against the United States. \n(GE 2 at 6.) While reviewing the affidavit to make any desired changes or corrections,\nApplicant deleted the first sentence of the five quoted above, by lining it out and\ninitialing the deletions. He added the following two sentences to the end of the affidavit\nin clarification: \u201cI support the Irish Republican Army\u2019s (IRA) their goals of an\nIndependent Ireland. [sic] I understand the use of terrorism to support those goals.\u201d\n(Both the deleted sentence and the added language are quoted for comparison\npurposes.) Despite being directly quoted from his affidavit in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b, he\ndenied these allegations in his formal answer, stating that there is no context, issue, or\nsituation in which he does or would support the use of terrorism. (AR at 1.) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant said he understood the IRA\u2019s use of guerilla\nwarfare, and he meant to say there are a lot of tools that any group or government may\nuse, \u201cdiplomacy, to war, unconventional warfare, terrorism, and so on. And to me it\u2019s\njust another tool that could be used.\u201d  When asked by his attorney if there was any set\nof circumstances, contexts or scenarios that he could envision supporting terrorism\nagainst any group, he replied:\nUltimately what I was trying to say, and I hope I am answering the\nquestion pretty much as you are trying, but any group that is and has, you\nknow, the legitimate reasons to petition the government to address their\ngrievances are cut off, they are not allowed to politically participate in the\npolitical life of their country, they suffer oppression of some sort, given no\nother means will resort to violence. All I was trying to say is I can\nunderstand why they would do that. It is a valid tool in the sense that it\u2019s\none of the things that people will do if they are faced with those situations. \nThen asked, \u201cBut do you condone the use of violence?\u201d he replied: \nI do not condone any use of violence against innocent people. There is a\ndifference between violence against innocent people and violence directed\ntoward, say, the military activities that you are combating with in order to\nfree yourself if you are an oppressed people.\n\n4\nHe went on to explain that he did not support either guerrilla warfare or terrorist\nactivities against our U.S. soldiers in Iraq because he supports that war and thinks the\nU.S. is doing the right thing there. (Tr. at 82-86.) \nWhen Department Counsel asked Applicant if he told the OPM investigator that\nhe supported or recognized and agreed with terrorism as a tool to overthrow the British\nrule in Ireland, Applicant responded, \u201cI made that statement and what I am saying is it\u2019s\na tool, like any other, you know, they engaged in diplomacy, they engaged in public\nrelations, everything is a tool.\u201d He further agreed that his answer would be the same for\nother groups like the Red Army Faction, the Shining Path and the PLO, it is a tool but\nhow we judge the use of that tool is something else. When asked if he also agreed that\nterrorism was a valid technique, he replied that depended on who is using it. He further\nelaborated, it can be a valid tool but would not be if used to murder innocent people that\nhave nothing to do with the conflict. When asked if his position meant that use of\nterrorism by organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, that had no other effective tools\nof warfare, was valid he agreed, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s a fact.\u201d He clarified that this validity did not\nmean that he agreed with the goals such groups were trying to achieve, because he\ndoes not. (Tr. at 142-148.)  \nApplicant stated in his response to SOR \u00b6 1.d:\nI deny revealing classified information to a South Korean prostitute whom I\nlived with in 1985/6 and deny not reporting the security violation to the\nauthorities. I did not know then and still do not know today that the\ninformation I revealed was classified. I did not think it was classified at the\ntime.\nIn both his November 2007 affidavit and during the hearing, Applicant admitted\nthat he did reveal information that he knew to be classified to the South Korean\nprostitute with whom he lived for 9 months around 1986. Although he knew he should\nnot have told her the information that related to his work in military intelligence, he did\nnot report having done so at the time because he did not think he had breached\nsecurity. He later revealed this incident to the polygraph examiner as a possible reason\nhe appeared to be deceptive in his responses about having disclosed classified\ninformation to unauthorized personnel. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. at 112-116; 167-171.)\nApplicant submitted testimony from his supervisor and declarations from three\npeople who have worked with him in his present position over the past several years. All\nattested to his strong work ethic, reliability, integrity, and patriotism. He has served two\nterms as commander of his American Legion post, and leads many support programs\nfor current and former U.S. service members. He was formerly active in AMVETS, and\nhas been a member of his Masonic Lodge in good standing for more than 30 years,\nwhich requires national loyalty and good character. (AE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. at 87-98,\n122-132.)\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The Government asserted that Applicant\u2019s statements and actions support\nconcerns under two provisions:\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\n\n7\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized\nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\nApplicant was denied a security clearance in 1989 based on his stated beliefs\nthat terrorism, as practiced by the Irish Republican Army and other anti-government\norganizations, is a valid tool to resist \u201coppression,\u201d and because he had wrongfully\nrevealed classified information to a foreign national with whom he engaged in an\nextended relationship while holding a high-level security clearance. Although formally\ndenying these allegations in his response to the SOR, he admitted their truth in both his\nNovember 2007 affidavit to an OPM investigator and during his testimony at the\nhearing. He clearly believes himself to be a loyal and patriotic American. He does not\napprove of attacks on U.S. interests because he agrees with most major U.S. policies\nand does not see the U.S. Government as an oppressor against whom terrorism would\nbe justified. However, his conduct, stated beliefs, and demeanor reflected questionable\njudgment and willingness to violate rules and regulations which he does not consider to\nbe justified or important. His recent statements and attitude concerning his revelation of\nclassified information to a foreign national reflected attempts to minimize accountability\nfor such conduct and his lack of appreciation for properly safeguarding protected\ninformation. The Government established sufficient evidence, in the form of Applicant\u2019s\nown statements, to raise security concerns under these two whole-person related\ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Applicant\nasserted that the evidence supports mitigation under the following three provisions:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n\n8\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and statements of concern originally occurred more than 20\nyears ago, and taken individually could be considered relatively minor. However, they\nreflect a pattern of decisions, beliefs and attitudes that he continued to demonstrate as\nrecently as his hearing testimony, casting continuing doubt on his current\ntrustworthiness and judgment. He offered no evidence of counseling or alleviation of\ncircumstances that might demonstrate such behavior is unlikely to recur. His ongoing\nvulnerability to exploitation does not arise from likelihood of submission to outside\nthreats or duress, but rather from potential disregard for restrictions on use of\ninformation imposed by others that he may disagree with. The evidence does support\nconsideration and application of each of these mitigating conditions to some extent, but\non balance its mitigating effect does not outweigh the legitimate security concerns\ndiscussed above.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves his stated beliefs in the validity of terrorism as a tool to fight perceived\ngovernment oppression and his wrongful disclosure of classified and protected\ninformation to a foreign national. Although the one SOR-alleged disclosure took place in\n1986, Applicant\u2019s ongoing attitude concerning that incident, as expressed during the\nhearing, reflected poorly on his current reliability and trustworthiness in security-related\n\n9\nmatters. He is fully mature, educated, and accountable for his choices and statements.\nHis coworkers and supervisor consider him to be dedicated, honest, and reliable.\nExcept in his formal response to the SOR, he has been candid and consistent about his\npertinent beliefs and attitudes. Although Applicant demonstrated minimal vulnerability to\npressure, coercion, or duress from an external source, his past shows his susceptibility\nto exploitation should he believe that government-imposed restrictions on his use of\nprotected information are less important than other interests. His demeanor during the\nhearing did not alleviate this ongoing concern. On balance, Applicant presented\ninsufficient evidence to meet his burden of persuasion to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from the personal conduct that was alleged in the SOR\nand supported by his statements. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubt\nas to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He  failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under the drug\ninvolvement guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted five items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated March 12, 2007) at 1-4.\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated March 15, 2006) at 1-9.\n4\nId.\n5\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn March 12, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on April 4, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n(FORM) on April 10, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material\nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  The case was assigned to me on May 22,\n2\n2007. Applicant submitted additional information. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegation in his SOR response under Guideline H.  The admission\n3\nis incorporated as a finding of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon\ndue consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduation from high\nschool in 1986, he served in the United States (U.S.) Navy from 1988 until his honorable discharge\nin August 2004. He also attended college courses until 2004. He has worked for his current employer\nsince February 2005. Applicant is divorced with three children.  He received a secret clearance in\n4\nFebruary 1990. On March 15, 2006, he completed a renewal security clearance (SF 86) application.5\nSince November 1994, Applicant used marijuana with various friends.

He takes full responsibility for failing the drug test at\nwork, but believes he may have been set up. He states his intention to stop using marijuana in his\nrecent response to the FORM. He admitted that he has gone for long periods in the past without\nusing marijuana and that he could do that again for the sake of his employment.\nApplicant enjoys his current position. He wants to contribute to its success as much as\npossible. He wishes to make a decent living for his family and is embarrassed by his loss of\nemployment due to failing a drug test. He takes full responsibility for the use of marijuana and\nunderstands that it was stupid to jeopardize his job. He claims that his family\u2019s welfare is more\nimportant to him now than smoking marijuana. He states he will make a change in his lifestyle and\napologizes for this mistake.6\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n7\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n8\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the\n9\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\n\n Id.\n10\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n11\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n13\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n14\nAG \u00b6 24.\n15\n4\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n10\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.11\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n12\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n13\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n14\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline H of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgement and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.15\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant used marijuana\nfor a period of more than 11 years on a social basis until 2006. He admits he was fired from\nemployment in 2005 for failing a drug test. Consequently, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition\n(DI DC) AG \u00b625(a) (any drug use), DI DC \u00b625(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use) and DI DC\u00b6\n25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Drug\nInvolvement Consideration Mitigating Condition (DI MC) AG \u00b626 (a) (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply\nbecause he was smoking marijuana in March 2006 when he completed his security application. Despite\nhis loss of employment in 2005 for smoking marijuana, he continued. \n\n5\nApplicant provided insufficient evidence or explanation to support the DI MC AG \u00b626 (b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as: (1) (disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts); (2) (changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used); (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) (a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation). In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he values his family\nand making a decent living is more important than smoking marijuana. Given his history of marijuana\nuse for more than 11 years, and despite his recent firing, continued use of marijuana, I find an\ninsufficient proof of a demonstrated intent.\nApplicant apologizes for his mistake and states he has thought about his life and will not be\ninfluenced by peer pressure. However, Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement security\nconcern. The other mitigating conditions do not apply in this case.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant\u2019s recent involvement with drugs leaves doubt as to his\ntrustworthiness. I have considered his desire to put this behind him, but I conclude it is premature to\nfind in favor of Applicant.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

He is a 30-year-old senior consultant employed by defense contractors since June 1997. He seeks to retain the security clearance he obtained fraudulently in July 2004. When Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in June 2004 (G.E. 1), he deliberately concealed his drug use between 1996 and June 2004 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 27 (illegal drug use, last seven years). In fact, he had a significant history of marijuana use from 1996 to June 2004, and had used hallucinogenic mushrooms between 2001 and February 2004, and opium at least once in 2000. Based on his false answers, Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance in July 2004. His clearance was transferred when he took employment with a new defense contractor in November 2005. In December 2005, Applicant applied for a clearance upgrade to top secret/special compartment information (TS/SCI)(G.E. 2) and continued to conceal his drug use by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions 27 (illegal drug use, last seven years) and 28 (illegal drug use while possessing a security clearance). In fact, he had continued to use marijuana after being granted an interim secret clearance in June 2004, to at least a Christmas party in mid-December 2005\u2014after he submitted his application for clearance upgrade.

He answered the SOR 20 February 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 20 June 2007, and I convened a hearing 30 July\n2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 8 August 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as\nfindings of fact. He is a 30-year-old senior consultant employed by defense contractors since June\n1997. He seeks to retain the security clearance he obtained fraudulently in July 2004.\nWhen Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in June 2004 (G.E. 1),  he deliberately\nconcealed his drug use between 1996 and June 2004 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 27 (illegal drug\nuse, last seven years). In fact, he had a significant history of marijuana use from 1996 to June 2004,\nand had used hallucinogenic mushrooms between 2001 and February 2004, and opium at least once\nin 2000. Based on his false answers, Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance in July 2004.\nHis clearance was transferred when he took employment with a new defense contractor in November\n2005.\nIn December 2005, Applicant applied for a clearance upgrade to top secret/special\ncompartment information (TS/SCI)(G.E. 2) and continued to conceal his drug use by answering \u201cno\u201d\nto questions 27 (illegal drug use, last seven years) and 28 (illegal drug use while possessing a\nsecurity clearance). In fact, he had continued to use marijuana after being granted an interim secret\nclearance in June 2004, to at least a Christmas party in mid-December 2005\u2014after he submitted his\napplication for clearance upgrade. Applicant acknowledged that he falsified his clearance\napplications because he did not want his employer and the government to know about his drug abuse\nhistory.\nIn January 2006, Applicant was scheduled for a lifestyle polygraph required by another\ngovernment agency in conjunction with his December 2005 application for an upgraded clearance.\nDuring the pre-examination interview, he categorically denied having used illegal drugs. However,\nafter the polygrapher began the examination, she stopped the examination because Applicant was\nvisibly nervous about the drug questions. Applicant then disclosed that he had used illegal drugs, but\nwas too nervous to provided details. The polygraph was rescheduled for February 2006 with a\ndifferent polygrapher. During the pre-examination interview, Applicant disclosed the full nature and\n\n3\nextent of his drug abuse, and the polygrapher was satisfied with the examination results. In June\n2006, the government agency denied the requested access to SCI because of Applicant\u2019s drug use\nand his falsifications of his drug abuse history (G.E. 3).\nApplicant accepts full responsibility for his drug use, and acknowledges the invalidity of his\npast rationalizations: He was under a lot of cultural pressure from his parents to excel in college, but\nhe had poor grades. Drug use allowed him to explain his poor grades to himself. He did, however,\nunderstand that drug use was illegal and prohibited by college, employer, and governmental policies.\nApplicant states that he has not used any illegal drugs since December 2005, and vows never\nto use illegal drugs again. He asserts that he no longer associates with most of the crowd that he used\ndrugs with. However, he also used marijuana with his brother and his girlfriend-then-wife. She was\na sporadic user with Applicant, but did not know the full extent of his marijuana use when she was\nnot around. She stopped using marijuana in early 2006, when she became pregnant with their\ndaughter, now nine-months-old. Applicant cites his new family obligations as further incentive to\nremain drug free. Applicant has disclosed his full drug history to his wife and his brother.\nNevertheless, neither his parents nor his sister are aware of his drug history. The record contains no\nindependent evidence of Applicant\u2019s work performance or character.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v.

Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana, use and purchase\nof hallucinogenic mushrooms, and use of opium are neither distant in time or infrequent.  His\n4\nabstinence from drug use\u2014just over 18 months\u2014is inadequate to demonstrate an intent to refrain\nfrom drug use in the future.   I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely to use illegal drugs in the\n5\nfuture.  Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E and J, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his illegal drug use from\nthe government.  He did so knowing that his illegal drug use was prohibited by both company and\n6\ngovernmental policies. But for the polygraph examination, he might never have disclosed the truth.\nFurther, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information was\nrelevant to a clearance decision. Applicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the government from evaluating\nhis illegal drug use in a timely fashion, and at a time when such recent drug use would have raised\nsignificant security concerns. In addition, the government detrimentally relied on Applicant\u2019s\nfalsifications in granting his clearance. Finally, his disclosure of illegal drug use in February 2006\nwas neither prompt nor forthright. Indeed, for practical purposes, it was forced from him.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer clearly establishes that he intended to conceal his illegal drug use from\nthe government and effect the course of his background investigation. This conduct violated 18\nU.S.C. \u00a71001,  whether he was successful in effecting the course of his investigation or not.\n7\nHowever, in this case his falsifications did influence the investigation, and he was granted his\nclearance.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use demonstrates a lack of candor required of\ncleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse\ninformation about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on\napplicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived\nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\nhimself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other\nsecurity concerns in the future, something the government relies on to perform damage assessments\nand limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put\nhis personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E and J against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

That favorable finding is not at issue on appeal.\n1\nFor example, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant had two sisters, age 46 and\n2\n45, and that her mother died in 1990; when in fact her sisters were age 54 and 45, and her mother died in 1996.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 12, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On October\n26, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because\nthere were multiple errors in the Judge\u2019s findings.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument\npersuasive.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nSome of the errors asserted by Applicant relate to the Guideline C allegations which were\nresolved in her favor and, therefore, are not at issue on appeal.  Other assertions of error are based\non new evidence in the form of Applicant\u2019s statements in her brief as to various details about her\nfamily which did not appear in the record below.  The Board may not consider this new evidence on\nappeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00184 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2007).  \nWith respect to the balance of the findings at issue, the Board concludes that they are based\non substantial evidence, they constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record,\nor they involve harmless error in that it would not change the outcome of the case.   Applicant has\n2\nnot met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to her\ncircumstances of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record\nevidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and\n\nDecision at 6-8.\n3\n3\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at\n7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\nApplicant elected to have her case decided upon the written record\u2014a circumstance which\nmeant the Judge did not have an opportunity to question Applicant about her family ties and evaluate\nher credibility in the context of a hearing.  Most of Applicant\u2019s submission in response to the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) related to the Guideline C security concerns which\nwere resolved in her favor.  Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred\nin concluding that the Guideline B allegations had not been mitigated\u2014given the limited record in\nthis case.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s decision, she has not established\nthat it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.   The Judge found in favor of\n3\nApplicant under Guideline C, but articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any\nmitigating conditions or factors with respect to the Guideline B allegations.  He reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number\nof variables to reach a commonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In some instances, as noted\nearlier, this process led to favorable findings for Applicant.  However, the Judge also articulated a\nreasonable concern that Applicant's circumstances created a conflict of interest that could potentially\nmake her vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.  That concern is based on close family ties\nin Taiwan, considered in the context of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis\nthe United States.  Applicant offers an alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However,\nthat alternative interpretation of the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s\ninterpretation arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has articulated a rational explanation for his unfavorable\ndetermination under the disqualifying and mitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there\nis sufficient record evidence to support that determination\u2014given the standard that required the\nJudge to err on the side of national security.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 06-04371 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct.\n18, 2007).\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple\nMichael D.

Michael Lyles, Esq.\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 43-year-old U. S. citizen, who held an Australian passport from 1994 until July\n\nItem 4 at 14.\n1\nItem 3.\n2\nItem 4 at 11.\n3\nItem 3.\n4\n2\n2007 when it was destroyed at his request by his employer\u2019s security officer. His wife was born in\nAustralia and is a U.S. resident alien, awaiting U.S. citizenship. He mitigated the security concerns\nraised by foreign preference. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 15, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86). The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 23, 2007, detailing the basis for its\ndecision-security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nOn May 10, 2007, Applicant filed a written response to the SOR, admitting the allegation,\nand elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On June 22, 2007,\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Government\nItems and mailed Applicant a complete copy on June 27, 2007. Applicant had 30 days from receipt\nof the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation or mitigation.\nApplicant received the FORM on June 28, 2007, and timely submitted additional information.\nDepartment Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s documents that I later marked as Applicant\nExhibits (AX) 1 and 2. The case was assigned to me on August 13, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his response to the SOR, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 43-year-old married man, who was born and resides in the United States. His\nwife was born in Australia and is a resident alien of the United States.  She intended to obtain U.S.\n1\ncitizenship in the summer of 2007.  They married in 1995 in the United States, and had two children\n2\nwho were born here. He attended a university in the United States from 1986 to 1989. Since August\n1995, he has worked as a technician for a federal contractor.  He held a clearance from 1986 to 1991\n3\nand from 1995 to the present.  He completed his most recent SF 86 in December 2006. \n4\nIn 1994, Applicant obtained an Australian passport in order to travel more conveniently to\n\nSometime prior to 1994, Applicant became a dual citizen of Australia. (Item 4 at 14). The Government did not\n5\nallege, and I did not consider, his dual citizenship as a disqualifying condition.\nItem 3.\n6\nId.\n7\nAX 1.\n8\nAX 2.\n9\n3\nAustralia to visit his wife\u2019s family. It is valid until 2014.  Although he indicated his desire to\n5\nmaintain the passport at the time he filed his Answer, he was willing to surrender it, if it interfered\nwith his security clearance status.  He does not have any financial interests in Australia.\n6\n7\nAfter being notified that possessing a current foreign passport created security concerns,\nApplicant surrendered it to his company\u2019s security office for destruction. On July 24, 2007, the\npassport was shredded in front of the Manager of Security and Facilities Operations.  He was\n8\nunaware of the pertinent adjudicative guidelines or the Department of Defense\u2019s  policy that holding\na foreign passport could raise a security concern and operate as a potential disqualifying condition\nunder the foreign preference guideline.9\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria which must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility. Within the Revised Guidelines are factors to consider in denying or revoking\nan individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and factors\nto consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions). By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. Directive, Enclosure 2,\n\u00b6 E2.2.2. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about\nan applicant\u2019s loyalty. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. Instead, it is a determination that an applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988). The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any of the\n\n4\ndisqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case\nNo. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d Id. \nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter considering the facts in evidence and legal standards, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, I conclude the following in regard to the allegations contained in the SOR:\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference\nUnder this Guideline, a security concern arises if \u201can individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admission that he held an Australian passport, valid from 1994 until\n20014, the Government established a disqualifying condition under Foreign Preference Disqualifying\nCondition (FI DC) 10(a) \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is\nnot limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport.\u201d\nThe Government having established a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nrebut or mitigate the allegations. After learning that his Australian passport could jeopardize his\nsecurity clearance, he had it destroyed by his employer, which triggered the application of Foreign\nPreference Mitigating Condition (MC) 11(e) \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the Guideline, the\nadjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information\nabout the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nGuideline 2 describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d In evaluating the conduct of an applicant, an administrative judge should consider:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\n\n5\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s long work history for\na federal contractor, during which time he held a security clearance, and his willingness to dispose\nof his passport once he learned of the potential problems it created for his employment, I concluded\nthat he does not pose a security risk and that he sufficiently mitigated the security concerns raised\nunder foreign preference.  Accordingly, Guideline C is found for him. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

RIVERA\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born, grew up, and was educated in Taiwan. She immigrated to the United\nStates sometime in the 1980s. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005. Applicant\u2019s ties of\naffection and/or obligation and contacts with her sisters who are citizens and residents of Taiwan,\npose an unacceptable security risk. Her favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the foreign\ninfluence security concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n1\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n  There is no evidence in the FORM to determine when Applicant entered the United States or the\n2\ncircumstances concerning her arrival to the United States.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The SOR informed Applicant that based\non available information, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information and\nsubmitted the case to an administrative judge for a security determination.  \n1\nOn April 3, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, admitted the two allegations under Guideline\nB, denied the two allegations under Guideline C, and requested a decision without a hearing. On July\n31, 2007, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which was mailed on\nAugust 6, 2007. Applicant received it on August 10, 2007. She answered the FORM on August 29,\n2007, and submitted additional information for consideration within the 30-day period. On\nSeptember 14, 2007, the case was initially assigned to another administrative judge. It was\ntransferred to me on September 19, 2007, due to case load considerations. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. She admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, with explanations.\nHer admissions are incorporated herein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of Applicant\u2019s\nanswers to the SOR and the FORM, and the FORM evidence, I make the following additional\nfindings of facts.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior software engineer who has worked for a Department of\nDefense (DoD) contractor since June 2005. She was born, raised, and educated in the Republic of\nChina (Taiwan). Sometime in the 1980s she immigrated to the United States.  From September 1989\n2\nto February 1992 she attended a U.S. university where she received a masters degree in arts. She\nmarried a U.S.-born-citizen in 2004. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2005, and\nreceived her U.S. passport in May 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s work history shows that since 1995 she has worked for six different companies,\nbut always in the information technology field as a software consultant or engineer (GE 3). In June\n2005, Applicant started working with her current employer, a government contractor. \nShe denied having any foreign property, business connections, or financial interest in any\nforeign country. She also denied being employed by, or acting as a consultant for, or having any\n\n  GE3 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application and her response to DOHA interrogatories.\n3\n  Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM.\n4\n  Applicant\u2019s answer to the FORM.\n5\n3\ncontact with foreign governments. She believes that none of her relatives works for a foreign\ngovernment.\nApplicant was issued a Taiwanese passport sometime prior to emigrating to the United\nStates. In January 2002, she renewed her Taiwanese passport to be able to travel to Canada. The\npassport had an expiration date of January 2012. Since her arrival to the United States, Applicant\ntraveled for pleasure to Taiwan and Hong Kong in May-June 2000; to the United Kingdom for\nbusiness in July 2000; to Hong Kong and China for business during August-September 2000; to\nChina and Hong Kong during September-October 2000; to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong for\nbusiness during November-December 2000 (she visited her family during this trip); to Canada for\npleasure in July 2002; to France and the United Kingdom for pleasure in July 2005; to Canada in\nAugust 2006; to Japan in November 2006; and to Taiwan in November 2006.3\nMost of her foreign travel was job-related. However, it appears that when ever she visited\nChina or Taiwan on job-related matters she took the opportunity to visit her family in Taiwan. When\nshe received the SOR in February 2007, Applicant realized her possession and use of a Taiwanese\npassport would adversely affect her ability to receive access to classified information. In December\n2004, Applicant renounced her Taiwanese citizenship and  invalidated her Taiwanese passport by\ncutting off a corner of the document.  Applicant averred that since receipt of her U.S. passport she\n4\nhas use it exclusively for her travels. \nApplicant has three siblings. Her 50-year-old brother was born in Taiwan. He became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in September 1992. After his divorce, Applicant\u2019s brother went back to\nTaiwan where he lived for the next 10 years. Around 2002, he was indicted by U.S. authorities for\ngiving his airplane boarding pass to someone else to enter the United States. He pled guilty to\nundisclosed charges, was sentenced to confinement, and placed on probation for three years (GE 5).\nApplicant claimed that by coincidence, she was in Hawaii when her brother was indicted. She\nprovided him with financial assistance ($3,000) during the ordeal. Applicant\u2019s brother is currently\nimporting Chinese merchandise into the United States in anticipation of the Olympic games\nscheduled to be held in China. He travels to China frequently. There is no additional information\nconcerning her brother\u2019s employer or whether he has contact with the Chinese government.\nApplicant also has two sisters, ages 46 and 45, who are residents and citizens of Taiwan. She\nclaimed not to be close to her 46-year-old sister, and that they have had no contact since her mother\u2019s\nfuneral in 1990. She works for a hotel in Taipei and is married to a Taiwanese citizen. There is no\ninformation concerning her 46-year-old sister\u2019s husband\u2019s occupation or employer. Applicant is close\nto her 45-year-old sister, and they have telephone contact once every two to three weeks. They also\ncommunicate via e-mail (GE 5). Applicant\u2019s sister was a part-time lecturer at a Taiwanese university\nand performed research. She is currently a doctorate program student at a Taiwanese university.  She\n5\nis single and according to Applicant her sister supports the general policies of the United States (GE\n5).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s husband was born in the United States. They met in Hong Kong in 2000 while\nthey were both there for business. They were married in the United States in December 2004.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) in 1930. She became\na naturalized U.S. citizen in March 1967, and is a resident of the United States. Applicant\u2019s husband\nhas extended family members living in Taiwan. Her mother-in-law keeps in contact with those\nrelatives. Applicant stated  she has not established lasting contacts with her relatives in Taiwan (GE\n5). \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Taiwan is a stable multi-party democracy,\nits government is friendly to the United States, and it has a good human rights record. Since the end\nof World War II, Taiwan has developed into a major international trading power and has become the\nworld's 17th largest economy. There are on-going tensions between Taiwan and China. Taiwan seeks\nto become an independent State, an aspiration which is strongly opposed by China, which sees\nTaiwan as a province of China. Despite their differences, contact between the two sides has grown\nsignificantly over the last decade. China is Taiwan\u2019s largest trading partner, and Taiwan is China\u2019s\nfifth largest. The United States has recognized China as the only legal government of China, and that\nTaiwan is part of China. \nAdditionally, I take administrative notice of Taiwan's active and historic roles as collector\nof competitive information and perpetrator of industrial espionage against U.S. companies producing\nmilitarily critical technologies such as information systems, sensors and lasers, and electronics.\nChina has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human rights record,\nsuppresses political dissent, practices arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and\nother prisoner mistreatment.\nChina is a nuclear power with a large Army. China is geographically vast, and has a\npopulation of over one billion people. It has significant resources, and an economy that in recent\nyears has expanded about 10% per year. China aggressively competes with the United States in many\nareas. China\u2019s competitive relationship with the United States exacerbates the risk posed by\nApplicant\u2019s relatives.  \nChina aggressively collects military, economic, proprietary, and industrial information about\nthe United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a global superpower;\n(2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim and Asia; (3) its leading role\nin development of advanced technology that China desires for economic growth; and (4) China\nconsiders the large number of Americans of Chinese ancestry as intelligence targets. China\u2019s active\nintelligence gathering programs focus on sensitive and protected U.S. technologies.\n\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\n6\nperson concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of \u201cthe nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n7\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761, at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n8\nthan a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199, at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.7, at 528, 531.\n9\n5\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take\ninto account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each AG applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.6\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) are the applicable relevant AGs.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n7\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling\ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness\nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it is\n8\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution\n9\n\n  See Id.; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n10\n  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n11\n2001).\n6\nof any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor\nof protecting national security.10\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that foreign contacts and\ninterests may be a security concern. If the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 6.\nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this\ncase, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information;\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and\nan applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for\nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.11\nApplicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection and/or obligation with at least\none of her sisters who is a resident and citizen of Taiwan. In addition, she has a close relationship\nof affection and/or obligation with her brother who, although a naturalized U.S. citizen, has been\nliving in Taiwan since the early 1990s. These contacts create a heightened risk of foreign pressure\nor attempted exploitation because there is the possibility that Taiwanese agents may exploit the\nopportunity to obtain intelligence, classified, or economic information about the United States. Her\nconnection to her siblings also creates a potential conflict of interest because her relationships are\n\n  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they impose. This\n12\napproach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level of security concern or threat\nit presents to the United States. \n7\nsufficiently close to raise a security concern about her vulnerability to possible coercion through her\nsiblings in Taiwan. \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially disqualifying\nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.\nThree foreign influence mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to these\ndisqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I conclude\nthat none of the mitigating conditions apply. It was Applicant\u2019s responsibility to refute, extenuate,\nor mitigate the government\u2019s foreign influence concerns. Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to do\nso. The evidence shows Applicant has strong feelings of affection and a strong sense of obligation\nto her brother and at least one of her sisters. The closeness of the relationship is shown by\nApplicant\u2019s telephone and e-mail contacts with her sister. Her travels to Taiwan underscore her deep\nfeelings of affection and/or obligation to her sister. Additionally, Applicant has feelings of affection\nand obligation towards her brother as shown by her providing economic support for him after he was\nindicted and prosecuted in the United States. \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, I\nconsidered Taiwan\u2019s form of government.  Taiwan is a multi-party democracy. Its government is\n12\nfriendly to the United States, and has a good human rights record. Notwithstanding Taiwan\u2019s desire\nfor independence, the United States has recognized China as the only legal government of China,\nand that Taiwan is part of China. Taiwan has historically played an active role as a collector of\ncompetitive information and perpetrator of industrial espionage against United States. This coupled\nwith Taiwan\u2019s trading interests, and their trading relationship with China, heighten the security\n\n8\nconcerns. Taiwanese agents may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family living in Taiwan to obtain such\ninformation.\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, Applicant did not establish it is unlikely she\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of her family and the interests\nof the United States. Her frequent contacts and close relationship with her family could potentially\nforce her to choose between the United States and Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan remains\nvulnerable. She did not meet her burden of showing there is little likelihood that her relationship\nwith her family could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and\nloyalty to the United States, that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe United States\u2019 interest. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005, and her husband and her\nbrother are U.S. citizens. All of her financial and business interests are in the United States, and she\nhas embraced the American way of life. Furthermore, Applicant renounced her Taiwanese\ncitizenship to mitigate possible security concerns. Although this mitigating condition is partially\napplicable, these facts are insufficient to overcome the security concerns. \nUnder Guideline C (Foreign Preference), the government\u2019s concern is that when an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States,\nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the\ninterests of the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s possession of a valid Taiwanese passport constitutes an exercise of dual\ncitizenship and raises security concerns under Guideline C. Her possession of a Taiwanese passport\npermitted her to exercise the rights and privileges of foreign citizenship. Foreign preference\ndisqualifying condition AG 10(a): exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes\n. . . (1): possession of a current foreign passport, applies.\nIn December 2004, Applicant renounced her Taiwanese citizenship and  invalidated her\nTaiwanese passport by cutting off a corner of the document. Foreign preference mitigating conditions\nAG \u00b6 11 (b): the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship, and AG \u00b6 11\n(e): the passport has been destroyed, surrendered . . ., or otherwise invalidated, apply. Applicant\nmitigated the security concerns under this guideline.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable AGs. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s answers to the\nSOR and the FORM. I also considered that she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005, that she\nis married to a U.S. citizen, and that she renounced her Taiwanese citizenship. Considering all\navailable information, and the whole person concept, I find Applicant\u2019s available information is not\nsufficient to mitigate the foreign influence security concern.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive\nSection E3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant has mitigated security concerns arising from the criminal conduct incidents of\ndomestic violence through the passage of time and rehabilitation. Applicant did not deliberately\nfalsify information on his security clearance application, thus mitigating personal conduct security\nconcerns. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\n\nGX 1(Application of Security Clearance (SF 86), dated August 18, 2005).\n1\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n2\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nTr. 15.\n3\nGX 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated August 18, 2005).\n4\nApplicant also had two stepchildren in his first marriage. During his second marriage, he adopted a daughter.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 18, 2005, Applicant completed his security clearance (SF 86) application.   On\n1\nDecember 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal\n2\nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of  Defense effective September 1,\n2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. The SOR\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nOn February 2, 2007,  Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On June 18, 2007, the case was assigned to me. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on July 12, 2007. At the August 1, 2007 hearing, the Government\nintroduced two Government Exhibits (GX) 1-2  into evidence without objections. Applicant testified\nand introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A-D into evidence without objections from Department\nCounsel. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 10, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted allegations in subparagraphs 1.a and 2.a in his SOR response under\nGuideline J and Guideline E.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\n3\nconsideration, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduation from high\nschool in 1977, he worked in his family\u2019s alarm business. Applicant completed several training\ncourses in electronics and alarm systems for his work over the years. Eventually, he opened his own\nbusiness. After retirement, he decided to work for a defense contractor. He has worked for his current\nemployer since April 1999.   He is twice divorced and is currently married with one biological son,\n4\nwho is seven years old, and two adult stepchildren.5\nApplicant\u2019s third marriage has been very difficult and tumultuous. He and his wife lived\ntogether a few years before marriage. They had a child in 1999, and married in 2000. Many domestic\ninstances have occurred over the years, and Applicant has filed charges against his wife several\n\nTr.19.\n6\nTr.\n7\nTr.62.\n8\nGX 2 (Municipal Court citation).\n9\nId.\n10\nTr. 36.\n11\n4\ntimes.  Shortly after the marriage in 2001, Applicant\u2019s wife filed a charge for simple assault-\n6\ndomestic violence against him. After an argument led to a physical altercation, Applicant suffered\neight broken ribs. When the police were called to the home, however,  charges were filed against\nApplicant. His wife did not appear in court for the charges and there is no information on the\ndisposition of the case.7\nDuring this period in his marriage, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law lived with\nhim and his wife in his home.  The parents-in-law were both alcoholics and were often evicted from\ntheir own home due to inability to pay the rent. When they lived with Applicant, they would drink\nheavily. On one occasion, December 20, 2001, Applicant decided he had enough. He told his wife,\nher two children, and her parents to leave the house. Things became heated. Applicant called 911.\nWhen the police arrived, his mother-in-law was passed out in front of the house and his father-in-law\nwas passed out on the bed in one of the rooms. Applicant remembers that the entire family was taken\nto the police station, but does not recall what happened in court.8\nOn July 9, 2004, Applicant came home and found a female friend of his wife\u2019s smoking\nmarijuana in front of his young son. His wife\u2019s friend was temporarily living with them at the time\nbecause her husband was in jail.  Applicant told his wife that her friend needed to move out because\nhe feared she would be a bad influence on his son.  His wife said \u2018no\u201d and they argued. Charges were\nfiled, but Applicant was found not guilty of simple assault-domestic violence.9\nIn January 2005, he was charged and pled guilty to simple assault.  This incident occurred\n10\nafter his wife moved out of the house with his son and neglected to tell him where they were going.\nApplicant found his wife with another man who had their son in his possession. Applicant argued\nwith the man. He wanted his son and the man grabbed him. Applicant grabbed him and swung at\nhim. The man filed charges against Applicant. Applicant was not arrested at the time of the incident.\nHowever, police came to his home and had an arrest warrant for him. He went peacefully with the\npolice to the department, and was released under a signature bond. \nApplicant was also charged with making threatening phone calls to this man.  He testified\ncredibly that he did not even know the man and did not make any threatening phone calls. He\nbelieves this was an attempt by his wife to tarnish his name. He testified at the hearing  that he pled\nnot guilty to any threatening or harassing phone calls. He thought the Judge dismissed the charges\nwhen the Judge learned that Applicant\u2019s wife was still married to him.  He was fined for each\n11\ncharge, totaling $170.00. The Municipal Court report confirms the fines but details a conviction of\nGuilty on February 2, 2005 for both charges.\n\n5\nApplicant wanted his third marriage to succeed for the sake of his only biological son. He\nadmitted there were so many times that he and his wife argued that he did not always remember the\nexact incident. He was adamant that he filed charges against his wife several times and that he has\nnever struck a woman. He paid many fines in court after the domestic violence incidents, but he\nbelieved his name had been cleared. Applicant feared that he and his wife would lose custody of their\nson. He went to parenting class alone. He even considered filing for divorce so that he could keep\nhis son safe. He voluntarily went to anger management classes and a family values class in late 2004.\nHe also attended parenting counseling. Applicant sought such education voluntarily because he\nwanted to save the marriage for his only son. He also was concerned that if a custody issue arose in\nthe future, he would be in a stronger position with the family counseling. He, his wife, and their son\nnow live alone in the family home. His wife\u2019s parents are now deceased and the two stepsons are out\nof the home.\nIn August 2005, Applicant, his wife, and son were together. Hurricane Katrina forced them\nto move to another state  after they lost their home in the flooding. His son attended a new school\nand was doing well. Applicant continued to do well at work and received a promotion. Applicant\nobtained family counseling for six months, from February until July 2006. The family situation was\nsteadily improving.\nOn November 5, 2006, Applicant, his wife and his seven year old son were in an automobile\naccident on November 5, 2006. Their car was hit at a great speed, and all three were injured.\nApplicant\u2019s wife suffered very serious injuries to her hip and leg.  She required physical therapy and\nstill has trouble with her mobility. Applicant\u2019s son was traumatized by the accident, and received\ncounseling at his school. Applicant states the accident, although tragic, has brought them together\nas a family. He spends more time with his son. His wife is less volatile and has seen a counselor.\nApplicant feels they all work together as a team. There have been no incidents in more than two\nyears. He now has tools to deal with disagreements when they arise. \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application on August 18, 2005, he\nresponded \u201cno\u201d to Section 23. F Your Police Record: In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for,\ncharged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave\nout traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)  In his first\nanswer to the SOR, he did not respond to this allegation. A second request was made for him to\nanswer the SOR. This time he admitted to the charge of the falsification as to question 23 F on his\nsecurity application. He said that after speaking with his security manager, he realized the need to\ndisclose any incident regardless of the outcome. At the hearing, he further explained that he believed\nbecause he had only paid a fine and it was less than $150  that he did not have to list it on the SF 86.\nHe acknowledged that he made a mistake by failing to disclose information related to the above. He\nelaborated that when he went through the paperwork prior to the hearing, he spoke to his security\nmanager who told him that any violation should be listed on the security form, even if Applicant was\nonly charged and found not guilty. At the hearing, Applicant seemed quite confused about the\nvarious incidents. He said that there were so many domestic situations that he believed as long as\nhe was found not guilty his record was clear. In fact, on the security application he made other\nmistakes such as not listing his son or his stepchildren. He also believed that when he paid a fine for\nthe 2005 simple assault and harassment that it was not a conviction. At the hearing, he stated it was\nso confusing that he needed a hearing to clear up the answers that he gave to the SOR.  I found his\ntestimony credible. He did not intend to deceive or lie about the domestic charges.\n\nAX A ( Certificate of Achievement) dated June 29, 2006.\n12\nAX B (Certificate of Achievement) dated December 11, 2006.\n13\nId.\n14\n Department of the Navy v.

He is\n12\nnoted for extraordinary professional performance,  going above and beyond normally assigned duties\nby assuming additional responsibilities in an outstanding manner, and supporting three shipyards and\nsaving costs to the facility. When his facility was inspected by Homeland Security, his group\nreceived an award due to the extraordinary performance.   In addition, his position requires\n13\ndiligence, attention to detail and exemplary security protocol as to all things pertaining to the\nnational defense. Applicant served admirably in his capacity.  He has received three promotions and\n14\nsupervises a large number of employees. He is in charge of all security for his company.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n15\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n16\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n17\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\n\n Id.\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n19\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n20\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n21\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.22\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndeterminations as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegations or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) applies.\nApplicant acknowledged that he was involved in the three altercations (domestic violence). Moreover,\nhe has a February 2005 conviction for simple assault and threatening phone calls.\nMitigating Condition (MC CC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies in this case.\nApplicant\u2019s conviction for simple assault occurred when he was trying to get his son back from a\nstranger. Despite the fact that Applicant believed he only received a fine, his court records confirm the\n\n8\nconviction. However, the domestic situation has drastically improved since that time. For more than\ntwo years, the family has lived without incident.\nApplicant\u2019s marriage was in crisis for a period of years. His alcoholic in-laws added to the\ncrisis. His wife\u2019s sons were also in the home at one point. His wife left the home and took his only son\nwithout Applicant\u2019s knowledge. Today, his in-laws are deceased and he and his wife have had\ncounseling. MC CC AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life) partially applies.\nMC DC AG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) applies.\nApplicant has voluntarily sought family counseling, anger management classes and family values\nclasses. He has persevered because he wants to provide a good, safe home for his son. He has been\nvery successful in his work. He has not mishandled anything and has garnered promotions and praise..\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 23 (f). He did not list any domestic violence incidents\non his security application for a number of reasons. He did not believe his record had any convictions,\nthus he had nothing to report. He believed that because he had paid fines  each time he went to court,\nthe actual charges had been dismissed.\nApplicant did not answer the allegations as to falsification the first time. When he received the\nSOR the second time, he spoke to his security manager who advised him to list any thing that ever\nhappened. He then admitted to allegation 2.a because he had omitted that information. He requested\na hearing to explain the confusion. I found his testimony credible. He misunderstood the question at\nthe time and did not know that he had to list the domestic violence until after he spoke to his security\nmanager. He did not intend to deceive or lie.  Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC\nDC) 16 (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefit or status, determine security clearance eligibility\nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) does not apply.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\n\n9\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant is a hard working man who excels in his professional life. He has\nworked through several crisis in his marriage. He values his wife and his only son. Despite stressors\nfrom his wife\u2019s behavior, her parent\u2019s alcohol and her difficult stepchildren, he persevered. He\nattended anger management classes, parenting classes and sought professional counseling. He wanted\nto make his marriage work for his family. The domestic violence issues were not because he was an\nabusive husband. At times he was the victim. He now has a better idea of how to handle difficult\nsituations in his marriage. Many of the earlier pressures are not longer present in his marriage.\nApplicant has proven trustworthy in his work during these many years of his troubled marriage. He\nhas received various promotions and certificates. There is little likelihood of a recurrence of past\nbehavior. I find that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have\na security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

MARSHALL, JR.\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 61-year-old administrative aide for a federal contractor. Between 2000 and\n2006, over $26,000 of her debts became delinquent. She introduced no documentation and presented\nscant argument mitigating financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and\nmodified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR). That SOR detailed reasons why, pursuant to\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under\n\n The Government submitted nine items in support of its case.\n1\n See SOR allegation 1.a.\n2\n Answer to the SOR at 3.\n3\n2\nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. In her response, notarized on June 14, 2007, Applicant admitted all seven\nallegations set forth in the SOR. This included six allegations regarding past due accounts totaling\nalmost $20,000 and one allegation regarding a garnishment imposed against her wages for a\ndelinquent debt in the approximate amount of $6,793.53. She also submitted a one-page explanation\nregarding the debt noted in the first SOR allegation, a delinquent account to an automobile company\nfor approximately $11,047. Additionally, Applicant requested an administrative determination based\non the written record.\nThe Government\u2019s case was submitted on July 11, 2007, and a complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant. She received a copy of the FORM on\n1\nSeptember 5, 2007, and was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A one-page, hand written letter, dated October 3, 2007, was\nsubmitted by Applicant. It provided additional comment regarding some of her delinquent accounts.\nThat submission was made part of the record without objection from the Government. I was assigned\nthis case on November 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to all of the allegations set forth in the SOR are incorporated herein.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 61-year-old administrative aide for a federal contractor. She has worked for\nthat contractor since 1986 and has held a security clearance since that time without incident. The\nmother of a 32-year-old daughter, Applicant was married from 1974 through 1981. \nThere are few facts of record depicting Applicant\u2019s life or finances and Applicant chose to\nlimit her submissions and narrative to a minimum. At issue are seven obligations, amounting to over\n$26,000 in delinquent debts. These debts went into collection at various dates between 2000 and\n2006. \nWith regard to a collection account by an automobile manufacturer for approximately\n$11,047, that account was put into collection in October 2006 and was still unsatisfied as of March\n2007.

Jul. 11, 1997).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App Bd Dec 31, 1997), Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n6\n3\nbut I already had a 254.00 dollar car note with [a bank] and some how they finagled a way to make\nthis loan go through using [the creditor\u2019s] motor company.\u201d4\nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she made some additional comments regarding\nspecific allegations. Regarding SOR allegation 1.g, the garnishment for approximately $6,793.53,\nApplicant states she only has five more weeks of $50 payments before the balance is satisfied. She\nalso gives the name and phone number of a bank contact person. No other information or\ndocumentation was submitted.\nApplicant also states that \u201cin November I\u2019ll be working on the telephone bills with the money\nthat has been paying the credit card amount.\u201d Although SOR allegation 1.c, for about $392, is clearly\na telecommunications company, it is unclear as to what other account(s) Applicant is making\nreference with this statement. \nFinally, Applicant states: \u201cThe personal Subject Interview. The rent figure of 815.00 a month\nis 875 a month. That maybe a typo.\u201d This comment is made to apparently correct a statement made\nby her in the FORM. No other illustrative or mitigating information is provided by Applicant.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances; it must be based on its own merits, with consideration\nof the whole-person concept, and in light of the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these\nfactors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the incident;(5) the extent to which the\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy\nguidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n5\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n6\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n7\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n8\ndecision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n10\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n11\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n12\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n13\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or an inability to live\nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.14\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline (AG) that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n See SOR allegation 1.a.\n15\n See SOR allegation 1.g.\n16\n This is particularly true since Applicant failed to identify exactly which of the cited obligations were to be\n17\nsatisfied with those sums. \n5\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions to the seven SOR\nallegations, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I find the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nWith respect to Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the Government has established its\ncase. Applicant admits, as alleged, that she has seven delinquent accounts. Those accounts comprise\na past-due debt of over $26,000. Therefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC\nDC) 1, AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 2, \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply. Given this showing, the burden shifts to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, to overcome the case against her.  \nWith regard to the first obligation cited, it appears that Applicant wishes to argue that she did\nnot think her signature as a co-signor, or that of her daughter, would effectuate the loan which would\nprovide one or both of them with an automobile.  While the argument is unclear, the fact is that a\n15\nloan was entered into for an automobile and that the account was placed into collection in October\n2006. Although her statement is somewhat vague, there is no indication as to what, if anything, has\nbeen done with the car or the account. No mention is made of a voluntary repossession, an attempt\nto work out an alternative repayment plan, or any other action which might tend to show that\nApplicant attempted to address this substantial and delinquent obligation.\nMoreover, although Applicant states she is almost through repaying one credit card\nobligation  through garnishment, she provides only the name and telephone number of a bank\n16\ncontact. While, at best, this unsubstantiated declaration might serve to suggest some progress toward\none obligation has been made, she has failed to submit any documentation reflecting any genuine\nprogress on this garnishment or showing her current balance owed. Consequently, she has failed to\nmeet her burden with regard to this account and this allegation. Further, while it may be Applicant\u2019s\nintent to eventually satisfy her telephonic obligations with the sums now devoted to repaying this\ncredit card garnishment, a promise to pay in the future provides no tangible evidence that actual\nprogress has been made or will be made on a debt or debts.  \n17\nWhen Applicant chose to have this matter decided on the written record, she precluded the\npossibility of oral testimony and inquiry which might have elicited sufficient facts to raise one of the\navailable Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Based on the scant facts of\nrecord, however, none of the FC MCs have been raised and Applicant has failed in her burden to\novercome the case against her.\nGiven the few facts of record, a whole person analysis must be made on minimal facts.\nApplicant is a mature woman with a grown daughter and a career. Applicant has worked for a federal\ncontractor for over 20 years. Similarly, she has held a security clearance for over two decades. Despite\nher familiarity with security clearances and the clearance process, Applicant failed to present any\nspecial facts or circumstances that might explain how these seven obligations became delinquent\nbetween 2000 and 2006. Indeed, although based on her unsubstantiated assertions and scant argument,\n\n6\nit appears that only the debt subject to a garnishment has been actually addressed. While Applicant\nexpresses plans to address some of her other debts in the future, she has failed to tangibly document\nany past or present efforts which might mitigate the serious security concerns posed by the financial\nconsiderations guideline. Consequently, Applicant failed to demonstrate that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance. Because any doubts must be resolved in\nfavor of the national security, I find all the allegations set forth in the SOR in the Government\u2019s favor.\nClearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.2.5 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRita C. O\u2019Brien, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts,  which he accumulated during his business and\npersonal association with his wife (W), to whom he was married between 1999 and June 2001, when\nshe passed away.  While Applicant relied on W to take care of their business and household expenses\nbefore and after their marriage, the listed debts were presumptively opened and maintained in the\njoint interest of W and Applicant and remain Applicant\u2019s legal responsibility absent convincing\nevidence to the contrary.  To date, Applicant has declined to address the debts, citing both previous\nuncertainty over legal responsibility and inability to pay them, and is unable to mitigate security\nconcerns associated with his past history of delinquent debts.  Appellant successfully refuted\nallegations that he falsified his security clearance applications.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 14,  2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, and subject to the amended Adjudicative Guidelines (effective September 1, 2006), issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 4, 2006, and requested a hearing.  The case\nwas assigned to me on January 16, 2007, and was initially scheduled for hearing on March 28, 2007.\nThe hearing was rescheduled for April 4, 2007.  A hearing was April 4, 2007, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three\nexhibits; Applicant relied on three witnesses (including himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript\n(R.T.) was received on April 12, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nFollowing a hearing objection by Department Counsel to a background approval letter (ex.\nB) from the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA). During the hearing, I granted leave to\nDepartment Counsel to research the nature and scope of Applicant\u2019s Hazardous Materials\nEndorsement (HME) from TSA (entitled \u201cTSA Determination of No Security Threat\u201d).  For good\ncause shown, Department Counsel was granted 14 days to supplement the record.  Within the time\npermitted Department Counsel furnished a memorandum brief detailing the nature and scope of the\nTSA Determination of No Security Threat letter, along with copies of the controlling regulation,\nbackground materials on TSA\u2019s threat assessment program, and statement of a TSA official to a\nCongressional Homeland Security oversight committee.   Applicant, in turn, was allowed seven days\nto respond.  Applicant did not supplement the record.  Official notice is taken of the threat\nassessment program and Homeland Security statement of TSA deputy administrator pursuant to Rule\n201 of F.R.Evi.\n\n3\nThe TSA security threat assessment was admitted as Applicant\u2019s ex. B.  It approves\nApplicant\u2019s application to obtain or review hazardous materials and credits him with meeting the\nrequirements for a TSA Determination of No Security Threat.  The TSA threat assessment is\ngoverned by the requirements of 49 CFR \u00a7 1572 and is limited to checking an applicant\u2019s\nfingerprints on file with the FBI, his criminal history, and any intelligence-related data on the\napplicant.  It requires only two days to complete (see statement of TSA deputy administrator) and\nis much narrower in scope and comprehensive in nature than a security clearance application.  So,\nwhile there is some overlap between a TSA threat assessment and a security clearance application,\nthe threat assessment is much narrower in scope and thoroughness than its security clearance\ncounterpart.  Its assessment value is, accordingly, more limited than the security clearance\napplication required of those who seek access  to classified information (as here).  As a result,\nApplicant\u2019s security threat assessment is entitled to some weight as an indicator of Applicant\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, but it is not entitled to any collateral estoppel affect on his security\nclearance application.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\n Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated six delinquent debts in excess\nof $38,000.00 that were either charged off or placed in collection.  Under Guideline E, Applicant is\nalleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of March 2006, by failing to list\nhis debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively.\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant denied each of the allegations in the SOR.  He\nexplained that each of the listed debts was created by his since deceased wife to defray expenses\nassociated with the trucking corporation she formed and controlled.  Applicant explained that he was\nneither an officer nor incorporator and assumed she was paying the bills of the corporation and\ntaking care of the business at the house after she became ill in January 1999 and stopped driving their\ntruck.  Applicant explained he did not have a credit card and was paid for his fuel and other expenses\nout of a company account that deposits were made to for fuel and expenses.  Further, Applicant\nexplained that he did not intentionally omit any debts, and never knew of any delinquent debts\n(personal or corporate) when he completed his SF-86 in March 2006. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nApplicant is a 65 year-old truck operator for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nAfter living and driving together for over eight years, Applicant and W bought their truck\njointly in 1996 for $98,000 (R.T., at 74-75).  They continued driving together and living together\nafter purchasing the truck and shared business and personal expenses.  Applicant and W married in\nSeptember 1999 and continued driving together on their truck assignments.  Continuing their\n\n4\nexpense-sharing arrangement they practiced before their marriage, Applicant relied on W to pay their\ntruck-related and personal bills (R.T., at 53).\nW was a heavy smoker and in November 1999 (two months after their marriage) she\ndeveloped serious breathing problems that required hospitalization (R.T., at 52-53).  During her\ninpatient stay, W\u2019s treating physician advised her to quit smoking.  She declined his professional\nadvice, however, and continued smoking.  Her condition worsened over the ensuing 12 months to\nthe point she had to give up driving the truck.  Applicant continued driving their jointly owned truck,\nassuming W was paying their business and personal expenses.  \nAfter W stopped driving the truck (in December 2000), she formed a corporation that she\nalone controlled under the corporate name of S corporation.  Applicant was neither an incorporator\nnor officer of the business and had little to nothing to do with the company\u2019s truck receipts and\npayments of expenses.  Applicant continued to drive the truck and rely on W to take care of the\nbooks (receipts and expense disbursements).   He exercised no oversight over W\u2019s management of\nthe trucking and personal accounts of the trucking business and doesn\u2019t know whether she ever\ntransferred the truck to S Corporation (R.T., at 110-11).  Applicant was paid approximately $500.00\na week in cash advances for driving  the truck.  Expenses (fuel and maintenance) were paid out of\na company account which received deposits from the Government for fuel and other expenses.\nW passed away in June 2001 (R.T., at 62-63).  Before she died, she had filed for divorce from\nApplicant.  Applicant was on the road at the time of her death on a trucking assignment and was not\nnotified of her death by any of W\u2019s family members.  A friend called him two weeks later to convey\nthe news of W\u2019s death (R.T., at 63-64).  When Applicant returned home, he discovered that W\u2019s\nchildren had completely cleaned out everything belonging to W and himself and taken all of W\u2019s\nbusiness and personal records.  Without any personal records, Applicant had no immediate way of\nascertaining the state of their individual and joint finances (R.T., at 64, 102-03).   \nUnaware of any prior debt problems (business or personal), Applicant was informed by the\ntruck\u2019s lender in September 2001 that the truck was going to be repossessed for payment default\n(R.T., at 54-55). Applicant was  never informed by the lender of the sale proceeds produced by the\nsale of the vehicle at public auction.  While he can not account for why he never received any notice\nof sale, he acknowledges he never provided the lender with any information about the truck\u2019s\nownership, or initiated efforts to obtain a credit report, communicate with the lender, or educate\nhimself about the status of the truck debt (R.T., at 87-88).  He attributes his follow-up failures to his\nlack of records after W\u2019s family removed all of the contents of their home (including whatever books\nand paperwork pertaining to the truck and business) following her death. \nShortly after the truck repossession, Applicant sold the trailer he and W purchased for around\n$8,600.00.  Title to the trailer remained in his name, and he sold the trailer in September 2001 for\n$2,500.00 (R.T., at  113-14).  Applicant sold the trailer in his name and doesn\u2019t know whether W\nassigned the truck over to her corporation before she expired (R.T., at 114-15).\nApplicant claims no personal knowledge of any of the debts listed in the SOR, except for the\nlisted debt owed to creditor 1.f and apparently expressed little interest in his business or household\ndebts before or after his marriage to W.  Applicant\u2019s accumulated debts which are attributable to him\non his credit report (see ex. 2) exceed $38,000.00.  In retrospect, he insists he should not have trusted\n\n5\nW to pay  their joint bills.  While two of the debts appear to be W\u2019s personal debts (creditors 1.c and\n1.e), he remains generally uncertain whether the listed debts covered in the SOR are W\u2019s personal\ndebts or their joint business-related debts (R.T., at 81- 99, 108).  Before she died, W only assured\nApplicant all of the bills were paid; she never identified individual debts for Applicant (R.T., at 103-\n04).  As a result, Applicant did not at the time of W\u2019s death know which, if any, of the listed debts\nwere delinquent (R.T., at 102-04).\nWhen interviewed by an OPM investigator in June 2006, the investigator informed Applicant\nof the delinquent debts on his credit report (R.T., at 62-63, 105-06).  Each of these debts (creditors\n1.a through 1.f were listed in Applicant\u2019s credit reports and opened between June 1995 (creditor 1.b)\nand June 1999. Two were opened as joint accounts (creditors 1.d and 1.f), three as individual\naccounts (creditors 1.a, 1.1.b and 1.e), and one as an undesignated  revolving account (creditor 1.c).\nIt cannot be ascertained from Applicant\u2019s testimony or his credit reports whether any of these listed\ndebts belonged to Applicant in his own right (compare exs. 2 and 3).  Nor can it be determined from\nthe evidence of record whether these accounts were used by Applicant and W jointly, or individually\nby either person. They comprise virtually all of Applicant\u2019s listed debts in both of his credit reports.\nAnd presumably, these accounts were jointly opened and charged for the beneficial business and\nhousehold interests of both W and Applicant.  Despite opportunities to do so, Applicant has been\nunable to provide any correspondence exchanges between Applicant and  the credit reporting\nagencies, or the creditors themselves, that could rebut or cast doubt on this presumption.  After\ninitially claiming in his response that the debts belonged either to S Corporation or W, he ultimately\nacknowledged at hearing that the debts were joint debts that he is responsible for (R.T., at 91). \nAsked by the investigator whether he would be contacting the creditors attributed to him in\nthe referenced credit report to arrange for payments, Applicant indicated he would not for lack\nmoney at the time to pay these creditor (R.T., at 86-87).  To date, he has been in touch with only two\nof the listed creditors referred to in his credit reports and SOR, one of whom (creditor 1.b) offered\nto accept $6,200.00 from Applicant in full settlement of its debt.  Applicant did not have the funds\nto accept this settlement offer and has initiated no payment arrangements with any of the listed\ncreditors (R.T., at 96-97).  Based on the credit reports, Applicant remains jointly and severally liable\nto these creditors.  At this time, he remains unable and unwilling to satisfy these creditors, regardless\nof his acknowledged legal responsibility for the debts.   \nSince W\u2019s death, Applicant has driven for C, a long time friend and contractor for L Corp.\nHe characterizes his relationship with C as a subcontractor and has grossed around $24,000.00 a year\nfor the past two years (R.T., at 69-70).  He has no current 401(k) retirement plan and by all accounts\nlives within his means.\nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions\nApplicant completed an SF-86 in March 2006.  In responding to questions inquiring about\ndebts over 180 and 90 days past due, respectively, he answered \u201cno.\u201d  He attributes his denials to his\nlack of any knowledge of delinquent debts belonging to him before meeting with the OPM agent in\nJune 2006 (R.T., at 97-101).  While he had some information that the truck was not being debt\nserviced, he couldn\u2019t be sure.  And after the truck was repossessed, he continued to believe it\ngenerated sufficient proceeds at the auction sale to cover any amounts still owing on the truck.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his debt omissions are sufficiently plausible under all of the\ncircumstances extant in the record to warrant acceptance, and are accepted.\nApplicant\u2019s character references\nApplicant is highly regarded by friends and colleagues who know him well.  The three\ncolleagues  who wrote endorsements in his behalf describe him as honest and patriotic and one who\nunderstands seriousness of security and who would put his country\u2019s safety before his own concerns\n(see  ex. B).  A hearing witness in Applicant\u2019s behalf (D) has known Applicant since 1995 through\ntheir trucking exchanges and more recently as a dispatcher for the company Applicant drives for\n(R.T., at 124).  D described Applicant as someone he would recommend for a position of trust.\nA second hearing witness (C) owns the truck that Applicant drives, and they work as a team\n(R.T., at 134).  She has known both Applicant and W for many years (since 1996) and characterized\nApplicant as a very reliable and professional driver and one who would have rushed back to pay the\nlisted delinquent debts had he known of them earlier (R.T., at 134-35).  C expressed considerable\nfamiliarity with the Government\u2019s payment system when Applicant and W were hauling for the\nGovernment (R.T., at 146-48 ), and later advised Applicant of W\u2019s death.  Unlike her present\nadvance system in place, Applicant never had access to payment advances while W controlled their\ntrucking assignments.  C assures that all of the settlement proceeds were remitted to W, who placed\nthem in her S corporate account (R.T., at 148-49).\nC was not aware of any financial problems between Applicant and is under the impression\nApplicant did not become of the listed delinquent debts until he was interviewed during his clearance\nup-date investigation (R.T., at149-51).  C appears to be sincere in he accounts of Applicant and W.\nStill, she acknowledged she had no first hand knowledge of Applicant\u2019s financial issues until\nApplicant familiarized her with his finances during the clearance re-certification process (R.T., at\n150-52).  C\u2019s familiarity with Applicant\u2019s finances is too limited to warrant adopting her impressions\nof Applicant\u2019s state of mind . \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 1, 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These amended Guidelines require the judge to consider all\nof the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\n\n7\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively\ndemonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it\ncan deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n8\nApplicant is a meritorious truck driver who accumulated a number of delinquent debts during\nhis personal and business relationships with his wife, who passed away in 2001.   These delinquent\ndebts exceed $38,000.00, which Applicant has been unwilling to address to date.   Still uncertain\nwhether the debts were originated by his deceased wife for her personal interests or their joint\nbusiness and household interests, Applicant is neither able nor willing to pay these accrued debts.\nFinancial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about an the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his failure to document payments on any of his\nlisted debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC 19(c) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations).\n Applicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his deceased wife\u2019s creation without his\nknowledge or approvals.  He has both disputed and accepted joint responsibility for the debts and\nhas made no tangible attempts to ascertain the origin and status of the debts since his wife passed\naway in June 2001.  Since he began driving for C (following W\u2019s death), he has made no tangible\nheadway in addressing the delinquent debts attributable to him in his credit report.  His debt\naccumulations are cumulative, mostly factually undisputed as to amounts owing, and are still\nunresolved.  While there is some question about who opened the accounts and personally benefitted\nfrom them, they are listed as belonging to Applicant in his credit reports.  Without any documented\nevidence from Applicant to undue the presumption they belong to him, reasonable doubts about\nwhether they are his debts or not must be resolved against him.\nSince being shown his credit report by the OPM investigator in June 2006, Applicant has\nneither acknowledged the debts attributed to him nor taken steps to actively dispute them with the\ncredit reporting agencies and the creditors themselves.  Nor has explored debt repayment with any\nof the listed creditors or pursued financial counseling and/or debt consolidation to assist him in\nresolving his debts.  Without any more documentation to show the debts are not legitimate ones, he\nis not in a position to rightfully attribute all of the listed debts to W.  So, while his debts are partially\nextenuated by his employment circumstances with W and his reliance on her to take care of their\nbusiness and household expenses, his reliance on MC 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) entitles him to only limited benefit. \nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant based on his presented proofs.  Even though\nall of the debts are old and are likely collection-barred by pertinent statutes of limitations in his state\nthey reflect areas of continuing judgment concern absent demonstrated Applicant efforts to question\ntheir legitimacy and/or commit to resolving them in some tangible way.  Age of the debts at issue\nis covered by one of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations: MC 20(a) (the behavior\n\n9\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) has\nsome applicability, but is not dispositive.   MC 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue) has some applicability, too, but lacks any documented follow-up to contest or resolve any\nof the listed debts in his credit reports and SOR\nPotentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by our Appeal Board\nto absorb security risks associated with unresolved delinquent debts.  While statutes of limitation in\ngeneral are considered important policy tools for discouraging plaintiffs from pursuing stale claims\nand promoting finality in litigation, they have never been equated with good-faith efforts to repay\noverdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR\nCase No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).  \nTo be sure, Applicant did not assert relevant statutes of limitation in his defense, but\nquestioned whether these debts ever belonged to him before ultimately acknowledging his joint\nresponsibility for them.  His subsequent failures to earnestly address these debts and seek counseling\nand/or debt consolidation after being made aware of the debts by an OPM investigator in 2006\npreclude him from taking advantage of any of the other mitigating conditions of the financial\nconsiderations guideline. While the term \u201clegitimacy\u201d used in MC 20(e) could conceivably be\nstretched to embrace enforcement as well as ownership issues, the issue has not  been developed by\nthe Appeal Board to date, and has not been raised or addressed by either of the parties to this\nproceeding.   At first impression, the term \u201clegitimacy\u201d would seem to have been intended to\nembrace debt ownership questions, and not enforcement ones.  Whatever the ultimate reach of the\nterm, it need not be resolved here.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.   Financial stability in a person cleared\nto access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of\nthe clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties\nis vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases\n(as here) and bring into play security concerns covered by both the financial consideration and\npersonal conduct guidelines.  \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations and absence of any documented steps taken to resolve them, Applicant fails to\nmitigate security concerns related to his longstanding debt delinquencies and judgment lapses\nassociated therein.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-\nparagraphs 2.a through 2.f of the SOR.\nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Applicant\u2019s clearance application\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised under\nthe personal conduct guideline, too, as the result of his omissions of his debts in the SF-86\napplication he completed in March 2006.  By omitting debts attributable to him over 180 and 90 days\ndelinquent, respectively, Applicant failed to furnish materially important background information\n\n10\nabout his debts that was needed for the Government to properly process and evaluate his security\nclearance application. \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions are attributable to his  mistaken belief he had no debts over 180\nand 90 days delinquent.  Applicant\u2019s impressions at the time, while potentially mistaken (based on\nthe absence of furnished documentation in the record), were made in good faith, without any\nindicated intent to mislead. Applicant\u2019s explanations, considering both the circumstances\nsurrounding the furnished information at the time and Applicant\u2019s overall reputation for honesty and\ntrustworthiness among his friends and colleagues who know him well, enable him to convincingly\nrefute the falsification allegations.  Considering all of the evidence produced in this record, favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the personal conduct guideline allegations that Applicant\nknowingly and wilfully omitted debts more than 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively, when\ncompleting his security clearance application.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Applicant answered the SOR 14 May 2007, and\n1\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 5 July 2007, and I convened a hearing 20 August\n2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 29 August 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the financial allegations of the SOR, except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.g.,\nand 1.f. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She is a 31-year-old\naccounting clerk for a defense contractor since January 2005. She appears to have held a clearance\nin 1995.\nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling over $12,000. Each of these debts is\ndocumented in Applicant\u2019s credit reports, including credit reports she submitted to support her case.\nApplicant admits six debts totaling over $9,000, including a deficiency amount of over $8000 for\na repossessed automobile. She attributes her financial difficulties to several periods of\nunemployment she experienced between May 1999 and February 2004 as well as her own negligence\nin dealing with her financial responsibilities. Her financial troubles are compounded by the fact that\nshe is a single mother of three children, ages 14, 11, and 1, who receives no child support from the\nfathers.\nAs a result of a subject interview during her background investigation in May 2006, she\nrealized that her financial troubles raised security concerns.

However, it does not\nappear how much actual credit counseling is being done, and Applicant does not appear to be\noperating with any kind of budget. She states that she is trying to make payment arrangements with\nher creditors, but does not appear to have reached any firm agreements or begun any repayment of\nher acknowledged debts.\nApplicant\u2019s mother testified and confirmed Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (e)\n3\nconsistently spending beyond one\u2019s means. . . \n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n4\nunlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n3\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records document over $10,000 of delinquent debt\nthat Applicant is currently unable to pay, and for which she has not established repayment plans.3\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed they appear to be ongoing. Her debts are only partly\n4\ndue to circumstances beyond her control, and she has not acted responsibly in addressing her debts.5\nThe program she joined appears to be aimed more at improving her credit reports than actual  credit\n\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\ncounseling or otherwise bringing the problem under control.  Further, Applicant has taken no\n6\nverifiable steps to address her debts.  Even if I assumed that she would soon be reaching settlement\n7\nagreements with her creditors, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant would be able\nto keep up with any repayment plans or remain financially stable in the future.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. It is too soon to tell if he will\nresolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Clearance is denied. \n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on April\n18, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis\nfor the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations based on\ndelinquent debts. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn April 26, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on August 15, 2007, and the transcript was received on August 28, 2007.\nThe record was kept open until August 29, 2007, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit\ndocumentary information about his financial situation, as he did not submit any during the hearing.\nTo date, he has not submitted post-hearing documentation.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges ten delinquent debts for about $17,379 in total.\nApplicant admitted eight of the ten debts, and he denied two debts for $759 and $29. In addition to\nhis admissions, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old communications technician. He has worked for his current\nemployer since May 2004. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for his current employment.\n\n3\nFrom December 1990 to November 1992, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy.\nHe did not serve his full enlistment because he was discharged on the grounds of hardship. \nApplicant married in 1990 and divorced in 1995. The marriage did not produce any children.\nHe has not remarried. Applicant has two children, ages 16 and 18, with the same woman. Paternity\nwas established many years ago when the children were young. He pays child support of $410 per\nmonth. As far as he knows he is current. He does have a child-support arrearage, however, stemming\nfrom the period before paternity was established. The arrearage balance is about $15,614 (Exhibit\n2 at 2). He understands that part of his monthly payment is applied toward the arrearage. \nConcerning his overall financial situation, Applicant\u2019s gross income in 2006 was about\n$39,000. After paying rent ($600) and other expenses, he usually has about $200 to $400 left over\neach month. He does not have a car payment, and he has a couple of credit-builder credit cards he\nis using to reestablish his credit history. Applicant is interested in buying a home and has saved about\n$6,000 for that purpose. He met with a mortgage broker who advised him to wait for the old debts\nto drop off his credit report.  \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. It is established by a December\n2006 credit report (Exhibit 2). It forms the basis for the ten debts in the SOR. The status of his\nindebtedness is summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013wireless account in collection for\n$1,081.\nUnpaid.

As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\n18\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \n5\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n15\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n16\n17\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nThe most pertinent mitigating condition is the second MC  of Guideline F. It receives\n18\nconsideration because of Applicant\u2019s periodic unemployment dating back to 2002. It does not apply,\nhowever, because the evidence does not show that Applicant satisfied the second clause of the MC\nby acting responsibly under the circumstances. He did little or nothing other than accumulating\n$6,000 in savings for a down payment on a home. A responsible person would have returned from\nunemployment and worked to repay their just debts. \n\n Examples of other large bureaucratic institutions that rely heavily on documentation include banks, insurance\n19\ncompanies, hospitals, universities, and the Armed Forces. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n20\n6\nThe other MCs under the guideline have been considered and none apply. In particular, the\nrecord evidence is insufficient to establish that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his\nindebtedness because he has taken little or no action on the debts he does not dispute (see table).\nWaiting for debts to age off a credit report does not fall within the meaning of good-faith effort. \nIn addition, given the lack of documentation, his various claims and representations about\nthe debts in the SOR cannot be accepted. Large bureaucratic institutions\u2014like the Defense\nDepartment and the security-clearance programs it administers\u2014do not run on word-of-mouth.19\nThey run on documentation. The documentation can be stored electronically or on paper, but it is up\nto Applicant to produce reliable evidence, to include documentary evidence, to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by him and proven by the credit report.  Although\n20\nApplicant is not legally required to produce documentary evidence to prevail, the lack of\ndocumentation in a financial case makes it difficult to reach a favorable decision under the clearly-\nconsistent standard. \n  \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. He has a history of unresolved financial\nproblems and it is too soon to tell if he will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner.\nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013j:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for security clearance for Applicant.

On June 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial) for Applicant. The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, (February 20, 1960) as amended\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended and modified, and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to\nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked. \nOn July 27, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request and the\nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on August 20, 2007. The matter was\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nassigned to me on August 22, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on August 28,\n2007, for a hearing on September 10, 2007, and held that day. The government and\nApplicant each offered two exhibits. The transcript was received on September 18,\n2007. Applicant requested that the record be left open for 30 days for Applicant to\nprovide post-hearing submissions. He subsequently requested an extension of time until\nDecember 3, 2007, which was granted.  Submissions were made on October 11, 2007,\nOctober 26, 2007, November 15, 2007, and December 3, 2007. All of the offered\nexhibits were admitted in evidence without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted five of the seven SOR allegations totaling $146,000 relating to\ndelinquent debts. He denied two with explanation. After a complete review of the record,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an\nassembly line worker for the past two years. He holds an associate degree in applied\nscience in avionics technology. He is an Air Force veteran with four years service\nending in 1999 as an E 3. He has served in the state National Guard for four years and\nis now an E 5. He comes from a military family and both parents were in the Navy (Tr.\n41). He has held a security clearance since 1996. \nAn analysis of the debts alleged in the SOR from testimony and documentary\nevidence submitted in the record indicates as follows:\n1. Par. 1.a.: Judgment of $9, 451 entered in December 2006 for credit card debt.\n2. Par. 1.b.: Real estate mortgage of $113,000 mitigated by sale of the property\nin April 2007 (Exhs. A and B). \n3. Par. 1.c.: Judgment of $6,108 entered in December 2004. (Exh. B).\n4. Par. 1.d.: Credit card debt for $5,744 placed for collection in September 2003.\nApplicant believes it is a duplicate of 1.a. which reflects charges and fees\naccumulated on the debt. \n5. Par. 1.e.: Credit card debt of $8,603 charged off in 2003. This debt is now over\n$10,000 with interest and fees and is being paid by a payroll deduction of $300\nper pay period obtained by the creditor. \n6. Par. 1.f.: Credit card debt of $3,941 placed for collection in 2003.\n7. Par. 1.g.: Account debt of $85 charged off in March 2002 based on damages\nto an apartment which Applicant had stated in his answer that he would pay by\nAugust 27, 2007. In testimony at the hearing he stated that he now challenges\nthe debt and could not find the documentation on it. \n\n3\nApplicant made some efforts to work with creditors, but when one creditor\nobtained the deduction from his salary, he became concerned that others might obtain\nadditional payroll deductions which might leave him with very little disposable income.\nHe then stopped contacting them (Tr. 21). \nApplicant was unemployed for several weeks in 2002 after which time he had\nseveral contract jobs as a temporary employee. The jobs did not pay well and he was\nnot fully employed until his present job began in April, 2005 (Exh. 1). It was during this\nthree year period that his debts accumulated and became delinquent. He recognized\nthe problem in 2003 and engaged a credit counseling service to work with his four major\ncreditors. When he discovered the service was paying only one debt, he canceled it\n(Tr.32). His annual salary from his present employer is approximately $33,000 based on\nhourly wages of $17. He lives with his fianc\u00e9 and their three year old child. She is\nemployed with an annual salary of approximately $15,000. He and his fianc\u00e9 share\nsome household expenses and pay others individually. He receives approximately\n$2,500 per annum from the Air National Guard (Tr. 38).\nApplicant is current on all household debts. He owns his own car without debt\nand pays $800 per month in rent. His fianc\u00e9  has a car note and pays it herself. They\npay $280 per month for childcare (Tr. 27). They have been working with a\ncounseling/consolidation service since the sale of his home. They advised him\nregarding the sale. The same service now helps him analyze the debts to determine the\nbest way to resolve them and in what order. Such service is required by bankruptcy\nprocedures as a precedent to filing (Exh. D 2). As a result of the sale of his home in\nApril 2007, Applicant received $13,000 which was held in a savings account in the name\nof his fiance (Tr. 12, 13, and 29). He hoped he would realize $30,000 from the sale and\nthese profits could then be use to resolve all of the outstanding delinquencies (Tr. 11).\nHowever, the house sold for less than he expected. During a conference call on\nJanuary 22, 2007, he stated that there was only $1,200 left in the account since he had\nspent the remainder on living expenses, auto repairs, and the fee to his attorney. He\nhas a 401k with his employer valued at $6,000 of which over $2,000 is available to him.\nAt the time of the hearing in September, Applicant had engaged bankruptcy\ncounsel who later filed under Chapter 7 on November 7, 2007. The reason for Chapter\n7 as indicated by his counsel is that the debts are unsecured, he met the means test,\nand feared a garnishment was likely from a creditor (Exh. F 1). He has paid a retainer of\n$1,800 for the services (Exh. D 4). The bankruptcy petition was filed November 14,\n2007, by his counsel (Exh. F 1). The current outstanding delinquent debts as indicated\nin the bankruptcy fillings are now approximately $35,000 (Exh. F 4). This is roughly the\nsame amount as the SOR debts less the home mortgage debt that has been mitigated.\nHowever, some of the bankruptcy debts appear to be for some different debts and other\ndebts are listed in the bankruptcy but without dollar values. \n\n4\nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive\nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also\nEO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or\nsensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate adjudicative factors under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) and\nfactors in the Directive, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in\nthe SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concern under\nGuideline F because an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. Conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nAG \u00b6 19(c). and evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. AG \u00b6 19(a).\nMitigating Conditions (MC) that might apply include the fact that the behavior happened\nso long ago or under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6\n20(a)), or the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol and that the person acted responsibly (AG \u00b6 20(b)), or the person has received\ncounseling for financial problems and there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c).\nApplicant was unemployed briefly and underemployed for several years and this\nwas partially the cause of his delinquent debts. The funds of $13,000 received from the\nsale of his house were in his possession for approximately six months held in his\nfiance\u2019s account but none were distributed to creditors pending the development of a\nplan to do so with his attorney and counselor. Now those funds are largely unavailable\nto help pay any of the debts. His salary is being partially withheld to pay one creditor but\nthat is the only delinquent debt being resolved. The smallest debt on the SOR for\n$85.00 that he admitted owing and agreed to pay in August 2007 remains unpaid and\nhe now has challenges the debt. \nApplicant has filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition as a result of advice of his\ncredit counselor but the action is too late to mitigate the security concerns raised by his\ndelinquent debts. While his current monthly income of $3,600 exceeds his expenses by\n$800 it does not factor in any income from his fianc\u00e9 since the bankruptcy is only in his\nname (Exh. F 4). The documentation and testimony at the hearing indicated the use of a\ncounselor and a plan to pay creditors over a period of time, which are factors to be\nconsidered in mitigation. However, the bankruptcy action taken since that time takes a\ntotally different approach (discharge rather than payment of his delinquent debts) ,\nwhich is inconsistent with his representations in the hearing testimony. His overall\nconduct in the resolution of his delinquent debt raises security concerns that are not\nmitigated. \n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, I conclude that Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his delinquent debts by his present action\nto eliminate them. While he undertaken to absolve himself of responsibility for his debts,\nhis actions have not met the necessary criteria for mitigating security concerns. Once\nhis delinquent debts are resolved, he is likely to have the assets to remain out of debt,\nbut it is too late for the present concerns regarding security issues. Thus, it is premature\nto grant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings as required by the Directive are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance is denied. \n                                           \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 26, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz,\nJr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because Applicant has\nacknowledged he \u201cmade bad judgments about the handling of [his] taxes\u201d and he is working to\nresolve his financial problems.  Given the totality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do\nnot demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security eligibility, there\nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See, e.g.,  ISCR\nCase No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, he still had significant outstanding tax\ndebts  and was still in the process of trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the\n1\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent and\nstill ongoing.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the\n\n3\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at\n4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record,\nthe Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

In response to the SOR, Applicant\nclaimed to have paid or settled seven debts, but produced no documentation to support\nhis claim. Finally, in about May 2008, he began to work with his accountant to file\namended returns using itemized deductions to reduce his tax liability. However, no\nreturns have been filed as yet, and it is unclear how much debt remains to be paid even\nwith the benefit of itemized deductions. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . .  \n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n3\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s credit reports establish his\nindebtedness. Applicant was aware of the alleged debts since at least November 2007,\nyet he took no effective action to address the debts before the SOR was issued.  The\n3\nonly action taken by Applicant after the SOR was issued was to hire a law firm to\ndispute the debts. That effort may bear fruit, but not in time to be much help to Applicant\nin this case.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were not due to\n4\ncircumstances beyond his control and he has not acted responsibly in addressing his\ndebts.  There is no evidence that he has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought\n5\nthe problem under control.  At best, only a small portion of the debts have been paid,\n6\nand those were not paid in a timely, good-faith effort.  Further, given his unwillingness to\n7\nseek or use financial counseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant\nwill put his financial problems behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\n\n4\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.
