    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from April 2011 to June 2015. He has been married twice. He divorced his first spouse in July 2020 after seven years of marriage and married his current spouse in February 2021, but they are currently separated. (Item 2 at 21-22, 32.) He has no children from his first marriage and from his current marriage he has two minor-aged stepchildren and a child born of the marriage in August 2021. (Tr. at 33.) Applicant has been employed by his sponsor since October 2019 and received a promotion in April 2021. His initial annual salary was $66,000 and after his promotion it was $77,000. Prior to joining his employer his annual salary was $44,000. (Tr. at 28-29.) His first spouse had limited part-time jobs, so he was providing for them on his $44,000 salary. (Tr. at 30.) He initially received a low disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but in late 2020 he was reevaluated, which resulted in higher rating that increased his monthly disability payments by over $1,600. The increase occurred at about the time he married his second spouse. (Tr. at 32.) The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $38,962, reflected in two credit reports from July 2021 (GE 3) and February 2022 (GE 4). Applicant offered a May 2023 credit report that no longer showed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 8, 2021. On \nApril 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR was amended in January 2023, \nto add an allegation under Guideline D. The DoD acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the original SOR on May 25, 2022, and the amended SOR on \nFebruary 1, 2023, and in each Answer he requested a hearing before an administrative \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 27, 2022, and the case was \nassigned to me on March 8, 2023. On March 23, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for May 31, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 and \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through B were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and presented character testimony from a co-worker. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on June 8, 2023. \nI kept the record open after the hearing to allow the parties to submit documentary \nevidence. The Government offered GE 7, a 27-page exhibit consisting of documents from \nApplicant\u2019s pending criminal trial. Applicant timely submitted four exhibits: a monthly \nbudget (AE C), a May 2023 bank statement (AE D), his Navy and Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal citation (AE E), and a behavioral health report (AE F). All post-\nhearing exhibits were admitted without objection. The record closed on June 14, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from April \n2011 to June 2015. He has been married twice. He divorced his first spouse in July 2020 \nafter seven years of marriage and married his current spouse in February 2021, but they \nare currently separated. (Item 2 at 21-22, 32.) He has no children from his first marriage \nand from his current marriage he has two minor-aged stepchildren and a child born of the \nmarriage in August 2021. (Tr. at 33.) \nApplicant has been employed by his sponsor since October 2019 and received a \npromotion in April 2021. His initial annual salary was $66,000 and after his promotion it \nwas $77,000. Prior to joining his employer his annual salary was $44,000. (Tr. at 28-29.) \nHis first spouse had limited part-time jobs, so he was providing for them on his $44,000 \nsalary. (Tr. at 30.) He initially received a low disability rating from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA), but in late 2020 he was reevaluated, which resulted in higher rating \nthat increased his monthly disability payments by over $1,600. The increase occurred at \nabout the time he married his second spouse. (Tr. at 32.) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $38,962, reflected in two credit \nreports from July 2021 (GE 3) and February 2022 (GE 4). Applicant offered a May 2023 \ncredit report that no longer showed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and 1.f. (AE B.) \nHe testified he had taken the initiative to call his primary creditor and had gone over his \ncredit report to look at the debts he and his wife had. He stated he called the financial \ninstitution that held four of the debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and 1.f, to see what his repayment \noptions were for the accounts. He explained he would pay what he could and noted he \nhad paid some debts in full. He offered he would make a budget to address the debts he \ncould not afford to pay. (Tr. at 40; AE C.) He took out a hardship loan from his 401(k) \nretirement account in 2023.

He withdrew $13,000 to pay medical debts and credit debts. The medical debts \narose from the 2022 birth of his child. (Tr. at 41-43.) \nGuideline F \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f: four accounts charged off in the amounts of $18,552; \n10,739; $6,493; and $1,005, respectively. Applicant admits the respective debts with \nthe credit institution. He has not established payment plans for these accounts. The last \npayments were in the 2016-2017 period. He and his former spouse were \u201cliving beyond \n[their] means\u201d and he could not make the payments because of his salary at the time. He \nwas aware of the debts but had been trying to resolve his smaller debts first. He \nacknowledged SOR \u00b6 1.f was simply missed. He notes they have all fallen off his credit \nreport. (Tr. 22-23, 25; AE B.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e: student loans placed for collection in the amounts of $1,137 \nand $1,036. Applicant admits the debts. He stated the loans had been frozen by the \nDepartment of Education (DoEd) during COVID and they were not requesting payment. \nHe enrolled in the Fresh Start Transfer Program seven days prior to the hearing and was \nnotified the day before the hearing that a determination was forthcoming. He stated if the \nloans were not approved for the Fresh Start Transfer Program the two loans will be \nrenewed with a new lender. He stated he will abide by whatever the repayment plan is \nestablished to pay off the loans. (Tr. at 24; AE-A.) \nI have taken administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the President directed the DoEd to provide the following temporary relief on \nDoEd-owned federal student loans: suspension of loan payments, stopped collections on \ndefaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, \nand Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for the above relief measures through \nSeptember 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 \nat 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt relief was extended several times by \nsubsequent Executive Orders. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-\n19. Congress recently barred any further extensions and DoEd has announced that \nstudent loan repayments will resume in October 2023. See https://studentaid.gov/debt-\nrelief-announcement. \nGuideline D  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: This allegation alleges that Applicant was arrested on October 5, 2022, \nand charged with Aggravated Sexual Battery; and that the felony charge remained \npending. In answering SOR \u00b6 2.a in the Amendment to the SOR, he admitted the SOR \nallegation and noted that the case remained pending and cited a court date of May 22, \n2023, (Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.a.) His middle school aged stepdaughter accused him of \n\u201cinappropriate touching of her behind\u2026 and that [he] requested to touch her privates.\u201d \n(Tr. at 64.) His stepdaughter disclosed to police that when she was approximately 10 \nyears old, he had sat next to her on a couch in their living room, where she reported, he \nhad started touching her \"here\" while motioning to her vaginal area for the detective.

He declined to say if his stepdaughter\u2019s \nallegations were false because he has no recollection of the incidents. He did not \u201cbelieve \nshe would lie about something that happened.\u201d (Tr. at 67.) He explained that he is not \ndenying the allegations by his stepdaughter and cites his sleep disorders for his lack of \nmemory for why he cannot recall any incidents. (Tr. at 69, 77-78, 81, 83.) During his \nDOHA hearing, he testified that he only remembers \u201cit from a nightmare because [he] \nkept reliving the allegation over and over. But what [he] remember[s] is, we were sitting \non the couch watching cartoons. I had my arm back around her and my hand on her leg. \nLike on the side. And I adjusted, because I was uncomfortable, and I accident[ly] touched \nher vagina.\u201d (Tr. at 68.) He stated essentially the same in his police interview. (GE 7 at \n15-16.) \nApplicant has been under the care of a licensed professional counselor since \nJanuary of 2023. He sought treatment voluntarily. He began reaching out to the counselor \nin August of 2022 after a referral from the VA. On his own initiative he walked into the \noffice after being unsuccessful making phone contact. His counselor indicated he had \nbeen \u201cvery proactive in seeking out treatment.\u201d (AE F.) He is described as compliant and \nworking hard in the therapy process and has to date done nothing to violate the terms of \nhis bond. He remains in the community because he is compliant and does not present \nhimself as a risk to the community. His counselor notes, without drawing any conclusions, \nthat Applicant is working hard in therapy to understand and work through his own history \nof childhood sexual abuse which he encountered at a very young age. (AE F.) \nAs of June 8, 2023, when the record closed, Applicant\u2019s criminal trial remained \npending. (GE 7) \nApplicant offered the testimony of a work colleague and former Marine. The \nwitness was very credible. He detailed his familiarity of some of the things Applicant had \novercome and events in the Applicant\u2019s life that had set him back. The witness understood \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and circumstances surrounding the \nconduct of Applicant. He allowed Applicant to stay with him and his family after Applicant \nhad been removed from his home. He identified the presence of rehabilitative potential in \nApplicant based on how accountable Applicant had been with all that had happened. (Tr. \n98, 102-103.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the evidence the establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \n\u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accrued delinquent consumer debts after a divorce. The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He has been employed by his sponsor since October 2019 and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhad a significant increase in disability income in 2021, as well as a raise. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge to\ndeliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in\naddressing financial problems. For example, to receive full credit under Mitigating\nCondition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d His recent actions to resolve two debts\nonly after receiving the SOR does not receive this mitigating credit. See ISCR Case No.\n08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish that he has made a good-\nfaith effort to pay or resolve his debts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant completed his SCA in April 2021. He testified he addressed two debts, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, by enrolling in a deferral program just prior to the hearing. He relies \non the fact the credit report he provided no longer shows the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f). \nAn applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be \nlacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 7, 2017). Additionally, he relies on the fact the credit report he provided no longer \nshows the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f). Evidence that debts are no longer contained in \ncredit reports is not sufficient for a finding that they have been resolved. See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01607 (App. Bd. April 9, 2015). AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is detailed in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment\nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion,\nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise\nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior\nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or\nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this\nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the\nindividual. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13 (c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13 (d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated sexual battery in \nOctober 2022. AG \u00b6 13(a) applies. In addition, while the criminal trial remains pending, \nApplicant testified during his hearing that he had touched his stepdaughter\u2019s vagina but \ndenied doing so intentionally. He declined to say if his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations were \nfalse because he has no recollection of the incidents. He did not \u201cbelieve she would lie \nabout something that happened.\u201d (Tr. at 67.) He also did not deny the allegations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(c) and 13(d) also both apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; \nand \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate\nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated\nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has\nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional\nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted he was arrested and charged with aggravated sexual battery. \nHe acknowledged the sexual behavior, which resulted in his arrest and being charged, \nboth in his police interview, after which he was arrested, and in his testimony. He \ndescribed his touching of his stepdaughter as unintentional but stated in the hearing and \nto the police he did not think his stepdaughter would lie. His treatment is recent and \nongoing. His admitted actions with his stepdaughter leave him vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, and duress and reflect a lack of judgment. The above mitigating conditions \ndo not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and D in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nD and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and sexual \nbehavior. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nCharles C. Hale \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

On March 30, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by video \nteleconference on April 20, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nbut did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary \nevidence. I held the record open until May 5, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were \nadmitted without objection.

He refers to his years of marijuana use as a \u201cdark time.\u201d He testified \nthat he last used marijuana in 2020. (Tr. 40) He continues to have bi-weekly contact with \na friend with whom he used marijuana after his discharge from the Army. (GX 8 at 10) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2021, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question \nasking if, in the last seven years, he had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, \nmarshal or any other type of law enforcement official; charged, convicted, or sentenced \nfor a crime in any court; or if he currently was or had been on probation or parole. He \ndisclosed his arrest in September 2017 for simple possession of marijuana, but he did not \ndisclose his arrest in October 2018 for felony possession of marijuana, and he did not \ndisclose that he had been placed on probation twice for his two marijuana-related \nconvictions. (GX 1 at 34-36) When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator \nin September 2021 and asked similar questions about his arrests, convictions, or \nprobation, he disclosed the September 2017 arrest and several traffic citations, but he did \nnot disclose his October 2018 arrest, conviction, and probation. (GX 8 at 8-9) He testified \nthat he did not fully disclose his drug involvement in his SCA because he forgot about it. \nHe testified that he was in a \u201cbad place\u201d and that he tries not to think about it. (Tr. 33) \nCredit reports from July 2021 and July 2022 reflect that Applicant has eight \ndelinquent debts. He enlisted in the Army at age 17, immediately after graduating from \nhigh school. He attributed his delinquent debts to his financial inexperience and not \nunderstanding money management. (Tr. 27) The evidence concerning these debts is \nsummarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: consumer debt charged off for $4,409. The July 2022 credit report \nreflects that Applicant previously had two loans from this creditor that were paid, and the \nmost recent payment on the debt alleged in the SOR was in April 2022. (GX 3 at 4) \nApplicant submitted a statement claiming that he is making monthly $100 payments by \nphone. (AX B) He submitted no documentation to support his claim. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: personal loan from credit union charged off for $3,824. Applicant \ntestified that he obtained this loan to make repairs on his car. (Tr. 44) After his interview \nwith a security investigator, he made a payment agreement in March 2022 providing for \nmonthly $100 payments. (Tr. 45) He has paid $1,203 and owes a balance of $2,634.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts and his unwillingness to resolve the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. Applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts reflect a continuing course of conduct and are \u201crecent\u201d for the \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd.

It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, because Applicant provided no \ndocumentary evidence that he is making monthly payments on these debts. When an \napplicant claims that a debt is resolved or is being resolved, it is reasonable to expect him \nor her to present documentary evidence supporting those claims. See ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.f, because \nhe did not begin to resolve these debts until he was confronted with them by a security \ninvestigator. It is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which Applicant settled \nafter receiving the SOR. \u201cA person who begins to address concerns only after having \nbeen placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019). The fact that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nno longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent \nevidence as to the disposition of the debt. See ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 13, 2019). It is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which Applicant \nhas refused to pay. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established for the car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Although \nApplicant disputes this debt, he submitted no documentary evidence of the basis for the \ndispute or actions to resolve it. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(f) (\u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position\u201d) is not established. Although Applicant apparently had a \nsecurity clearance when he used marijuana, there is no evidence that he had actual \naccess to classified information at the time. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 (App. Bd. \nAug.10, 2022). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long \nago) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There are no bright line rules \nfor determining when conduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time \nhas passed without any evidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). Applicant\u2019s drug involvement was frequent and did not occur \nunder circumstances making it unlikely to recur. His last drug involvement was in 2020, \nafter he was convicted of marijuana possession in February 2019 and while he was on \nprobation and working for a defense contractor. In light of his long history of drug \ninvolvement while in the Army, while he was on probation and working for a defense \ncontractor, I am not satisfied that his drug involvement is mitigated by the passage of \ntime. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement. As noted in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 26(a), insufficient time has passed \nsince his last drug involvement. He no longer has contact with the woman with whom he \nused marijuana while he was in the Army, but he admitted that he continues to have bi\u00ad\nweekly contact with a friend with whom he used marijuana after he was discharged from \nthe Army. He has not signed a statement of intent as described in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not make any effort to correct the \nomissions from his SCA until he was confronted with the evidence by a security \ninvestigator. He did not attempt to correct or explain his omission during his security \ninterview on September 21, 2021, until he was confronted with the evidence at the \nhearing. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications were recent, both pertaining \nto his current application to retain his clearance. They did not occur under unique \ncircumstances. They were not minor offenses. An applicant who deliberately fails to give \nfull, frank, and candid answers to the government in connection with a security clearance \ninvestigation or adjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). Falsification of a security \nclearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts, drug involvement, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

He stated that the provider then \nasked him, if he could kill his spouse, how would he commit the act, to which he said, \u201cI \nguess I\u2019ll stab her.\u201d He told the psychologist that he did not have any intent to do so. \nRegarding the incident with his then wife, he told the psychologist that they began \n\u201ctouching each other\u201d and eventually had intercourse. He stated that he thought it was \nconsensual, and that he did not think it was rape because she never said \u201cno.\u201d (GE 8) \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, severe, in \npartial remission.

Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; \npsychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall \nseverity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. \nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 \nweeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in \nnearly all activities . . . . Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., \npersistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming \nothers, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor events). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.

No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was hospitalized after expressing suicidal and \nhomicidal thoughts, and that he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, severe \nwithout psychotic features. Thoughts are not behavior. AG \u00b6 28(a) is not applicable. \nMajor depressive disorder is a condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) is established by that diagnosis. AG \u00b6 28(c) is \nestablished by the hospitalization. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant sought treatment from the mental health clinic, \nwhere he was diagnosed with major depression, recurrent. Seeking treatment is a \npositive response to mental health issues and potentially mitigating. It does not raise a \ndisqualifying condition. The document from the mental health clinic states that Applicant \nwas assessed with major depression, recurrent. I am unsure who provided that opinion. \nIn any event, this assessment is redundant with the diagnosis when he was an inpatient \nat a psychiatric facility. SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the opinion of the psychologist during the DOD-requested \nevaluation that Applicant met the criteria for major depressive disorder, severe, in partial \nremission, and that he had a mental health condition that could impede his reliability, \njudgment, stability, and trustworthiness. That is an accurate synopsis of the evaluation. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThere is no evidence of any significant mental health issues after 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife has forgiven him, and they have reconciled and had another child \ntogether. His job performance has been excellent, and his supervisor raved about him. \nNonetheless, I have remaining concerns. Applicant\u2019s conduct and mental state in \n2016 are alarming. He heard voices; he had suicidal and homicidal thoughts; he \nthreatened to kill his then wife; he provided inconsistent statements through the years; \nand his sexual assault of his then wife amounts to rape. None of the mitigating \nconditions are sufficient to alleviate those concerns. Psychological conditions security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant \u201cforcefully had sexual relations with [his] then \nspouse.\u201d That constituted a criminal sexual assault. The conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The conduct also \ncreated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an \nadverse determination under the sexual behavior and criminal conduct guidelines. \nHowever, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was a serious crime. It occurred almost seven years ago, \nand his former wife has forgiven him and moved past it. He was never charged or \nprosecuted, which cuts both ways, because it is not clear from the record whether he \ncould still be criminally charged. I also note the fact that he threatened to kill his then \nwife and provided inconsistent statements over the years. Applicant\u2019s conduct continues \nto make him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress; and it casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and I in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and psychological conditions security concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nOn September 30, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit \nany response. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. \nProcedural Issue \nIn the FORM sent to Applicant in November 2022, Department Counsel moved to \namend the SOR to conform to the proof. That proposed amendment would add \nallegation \u00b6 1.o using the following language: \nYou failed to file, as required, [State X] income tax returns for at least tax \nyears 2015 through 2021. As of the date of this FORM, the income tax \nreturns remain unfiled. \nApplicant did not reply to the FORM and therefore he did not admit or deny the \nproposed amended allegation. I consider his failure to respond as a denial of the \nallegation. Pursuant to the Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.13, the motion to amend the SOR as \nidentified above is granted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n), except for \u00b6 1.o. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since August 2020, as a subject matter expert. Since 2008, he has worked \nfor various defense contractors. He had short periods of unemployment (March-April \n2020; July-September 2018) in the past. He is a high school graduate and has taken \nsome college courses. He is married for the second time and has two adult children. He \nhas held a security clearance in the past.

(Items 3, 5) \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he hired a tax resolution \ncompany (Tax Firm) in July 2022 to file his delinquent federal tax returns for tax years \n2015-2021. While he or the Tax Firm requested and received \u201cW-2 Wage and Tax \nStatements\u201d for years 2015-2021 from the IRS, there is no documentary evidence \nshowing that Applicant\u2019s delinquent returns were filed.

(Item 5; SOR answer) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed nine delinquent medical accounts totaling \napproximately $2,600. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.k, 1.m-1.n) Applicant admitted owing these debts in his \nSOR answer. The debts are also supported by listings as delinquent debts in credit \nreports from February 2021, September 2021, and November 2022. Applicant claimed \nhe was unaware of these medical debts when he was interviewed in March 2021. These \ndebts remain unresolved. (Items 5-8, SOR answer) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed four delinquent consumer accounts \ntotaling approximately $9,200. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.l) He admitted these debts in his \nbackground interview and in his SOR answer. The debts are also supported by listings \nas delinquent debts in credit reports from February 2021, September 2021, and \nNovember 2022. The November 2022 credit report reflects that Applicant made \npayments toward SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1c., reducing the balance owed for both debts. \nAn earlier credit report reflects that \u00b6 1.l was paid. Of these consumer debts, only SOR \n\u00b6 1.d is unresolved. (Items 3, 5-8) \nApplicant cited a number of reasons leading to his financial difficulties. These \nreasons include having to rely on short-term disability pay in 2017 or 2018, where he \nreceived 60% of his normal pay; unemployment from July 2018 to September 2018, due \nto a layoff; and unemployment from March to April 2020, due to a job termination. (Items \n4, 5) \nApplicant\u2019s financial worksheet that he completed in August 2021 reflects a net \nmonthly income of $4,587 and total monthly expenses of $4,121, leaving a monthly \nremainder of $466. Other than his hiring of the Tax Firm to file his tax returns, there is \nno evidence of financial counseling. (Items 3, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015-2021 federal and state income tax returns \nand there is no evidence that he filed them. He also has delinquent medical and \nconsumer debts, some of which remain unpaid or unresolved. I find all the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. His federal and state tax \nreturns remain unfiled. He did not provide sufficient evidence to show that his financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He had several problems, \nsuch as unemployment and having to rely on disability income, at a reduced rate of \n60%. However, the evidence does not support a finding that he has taken responsible \nactions to address his debts or timely file his federal and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes fully apply. \nApplicant failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent \nmedical debts. He paid one consumer debt and is making payments on two other debts. \nThose debts are resolved in his favor. Other than hiring Tax Firm to work on filing his \ntax returns, there is no evidence of financial counseling and no evidence that his \nfinancial conditions are under control. He has not shown a good-faith effort to address \nhis debts or his federal and state tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), 20(g) and do not apply, \nexcept as noted above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his medical and \nunemployment issues, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts, \nand his failure to timely file his 2015-2021 federal and state income tax returns. \nApplicant has not established a track record of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d-1.k, 1.m-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c, 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GX 1 at page 45.) \nApplicant avers, in part, that she did not know the use of marijuana was illegal. (TR at \npage 19 lines 3~25.)  I find this to be a willful falsification as the use of marijuana is \nillegal under Federal law. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was not legal in State A where \nshe resided prior to May 2016. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used marijuana with varying frequencies from 2008~2021. She has \nheld a security clearance in connection with her job since 2018. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), \n(c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana usage was two years prior to this writing, and 14 \nmonths prior to the issuance of the SOR. She has also provided a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from future drug involvement, and three negative drug tests. I find that \nher past marijuana usage is not of present security significance. Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsified her 2017 and 2021 e-QIPs. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur. \n \n \n \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant falsified her e-QIP in 2017 as to her past \ndrug involvement, and continued this ruse by falsifying her 2021 e-QIP. Personal \nConduct is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant performs her job well. \n(AppXs F and G.) However, overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nPersonal Conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

I) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 36, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, as a \nsoftware engineer since August 2008. He completed his first security clearance \napplication in March 2021, disclosing marijuana use from July 2005 to March 2021.

Applicant also \ndisclosed two drug related criminal incidents: a December 2008 for possession of \nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, and December 2017 citation for \npossession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. The SOR alleges \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use as well as his 2008 and 2017 drug-related arrests. \n(GE 2; AE A) \nApplicant began using marijuana in July 2005, the summer before he entered \ncollege. He used the drug recreationally in social settings while in college. He estimated \nthat he used the drug at least twice per month. When he moved out on his own in 2010, \nafter graduating, his use of marijuana increased. He reported that between 2010 and \n2012, he used marijuana at least four times a month either in social settings or alone. \nBetween 2012 and 2019, he estimated that his marijuana use increased to once per \nweek in social settings. He obtained a medical marijuana license in December 2018. \nFrom 2019 and 2021, he used marijuana twice per week, using one-third of a gram from \na vape pen before bed. He no longer uses the drug recreationally, but for pain \nmanagement and as a sleep aid. He reported having a medical condition that benefits \nfrom his use of marijuana as well as lingering pain from an unspecified car accident. \n(GE 3) \nIn December 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of drugs, possession of marijuana, and possession of marijuana \nparaphernalia. Applicant parked his car a short distance away from his parent\u2019s home \nwhere he was living at the time, to smoke marijuana. He was observed by a police \nofficer, who approached the car. Upon smelling marijuana coming from the car, the \nofficer asked Applicant if he was under the influence of marijuana, which he denied. \nApplicant consented to a search of his car, which revealed drug paraphernalia. The \nofficer administered a breathalyzer test, but it did not detect any alcohol. Applicant was \narrested and transported to the police station where he gave a blood sample, which \ncame back positive for marijuana. He entered into a plea agreement in which he \npleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and the other charges were dropped. He was \nsentenced to ten days in jail, with nine suspended, fined $1,000, and ordered to take a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstance abuse awareness class. He was also placed on probation for one year and \nordered to install an interlock device on his vehicle. (GE 3-5) \nIn December 2017, he received a citation for possession of marijuana and \npossession of marijuana paraphernalia. During a traffic stop for speeding, the officer \nsmelled marijuana coming from Applicant\u2019s car. Upon questioning from the officer, \nApplicant admitted to having the drug in the vehicle. He had a vaporizer pen, containing \nless than one gram of marijuana inside. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to \ncomplete a pre-trial diversion program. The court also ordered him to complete a \nsubstance abuse class. During the class, he tested positive for marijuana, which was \npermitted because he had a valid a medical marijuana license. He completed the \ndiversion program in June 2019 and the charges were dismissed. (GE 3) \nIn his November 2022 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported that \nbetween 2019 and 2022, he continued to use marijuana one or two times per week. In \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant reported that in June 2022 he filed a motion to \nexpunge the 2017 charges from his record. He also claims that he has discontinued \nmarijuana use but did not provide a date of last use. He also acknowledged that his \neffort to stop smoking marijuana proved more difficult that he expected. He did not \nprovide a sobriety plan or indicate his participation in a sobriety support program. He did \nnot provide a statement of intent to abstain from future use. (GE 3; AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis  \nThe record contains evidence to support the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant engaged in disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. He did not provide any evidence to mitigate any of the alleged \nconcerns. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant admits using marijuana from at least 2005 to at least November 2022, \nas well as pleading guilty to drug-related criminal offenses in 2009 and 2018. The illegal \nuse of controlled substances can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 25) The following disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 26(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nNone of the relevant mitigating conditions apply. Although the medical use of \nmarijuana may be decriminalized in Applicant\u2019s state of residency, this does not alter \nfederal law or existing National Security Guidelines. No state can authorize the violation \nof federal law. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use violates the Controlled Substances Act, which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Under the Intelligence Reform and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTerrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, federal agencies remain prohibited \nfrom granting a security clearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance. (See \nDirector of National Intelligence Memorandum, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use, dated November 17, 2014). The Agency clarified its guidance \nconcerning marijuana for individuals eligible to access classified information in a \nmemorandum dated December 21, 2021: \nWith regard to the first topic, agencies are instructed that prior recreational \nmarijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative. The [Security Executive Agent (SecEA)] has provided \ndirection in SEAD 4 to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person \nconcept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has \nbeen mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable \nadjudicative determination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not \nlimited to, frequency of use and. whether the individual can demonstrate \nthat future use is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or \nother such appropriate litigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing- \nfederal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a \nsensitive position or holding a security clearance, agencies are \nencouraged to advise prospective national security workforce employees \nthat they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon initiation of the \nnational security vetting process, which commences once the individual \nsigns the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions.  \nApplicant has a long history of marijuana use both recreational and medicinal. \nSince at least 2019, he has used marijuana to self-medicate to alleviate medical issues. \nHe continued to use marijuana after applying for access to classified information. He \nhas not provided credible information to support a finding that he will abstain from future \nmarijuana use. \nWhole-person Concept \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts \nunder the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, which \nhe believes is the best method of managing the symptoms of his medical condition, \nviolates federal law. Applicant resolved the conflict of interest between treating his \nongoing medical issues and violating federal law in favor of his self-interest. In doing so, \nhe casts doubt on his trustworthiness and reliability as potential clearance holder. The \nevidence suggests that he will resolve other potential conflicts of interests in a similar \nmanner. Applicant\u2019s current and ongoing use of marijuana, even for medical purposes, \nis incompatible with the interests of the national security. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He was born abroad and immigrated to the \nUnited States with his parents, as a teenager in 2001. (Item 4 at 9) He has been a \nnaturalized citizen since 2010.

(Item 4 at \n12) \nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant spent the next three years traveling internationally. \n(Item 4 at 79) He was not employed. He paid for this extensive travel using credit cards and \ndisability pay. After returning home, he enrolled in college, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2020. (Item 4 at 20) He is waiting for a defense contractor to hire him, pending the outcome \nof this security clearance investigative process. \nApplicant was unable to satisfy the credit card bills that he incurred while traveling \ninternationally. By 2020, these bills had become delinquent in the approximate amount of \n$31,000. (Item 3) \nAfter graduating from college in 2020 Applicant began satisfying the debts. He has \nsatisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e, totaling $3,038. (Item 3 at 4) He contends \nthat he has resolved 1.f, totaling $646 and is making payments towards the resolution of \n1.c, totaling $4,750, but provided no supporting documentation. He contends that he will \nbegin satisfying the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.a and 1.b once he satisfies the debt \nalleged in subparagraph 1.c. Applicant provided no evidence that he keeps a budget or that \nhe has consulted with a financial counselor. Applicant acknowledges that borrowing money \nthrough his credit cards to travel internationally while unemployed was not responsible. \n(Item 4 at 79) \n Policies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant spent three years living abroad while unemployed and with limited means to \nsupport himself, consequently incurring $31,000 of delinquent debt. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means . . . which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of \nlate payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators,\u201d apply. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain outstanding. Consequently, the \nmitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does \nnot apply. \nApplicant readily admits that his decision to travel internationally while unemployed \nwith limited means to pay for trip expenses was not responsible. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is inapplicable. \nThere is no record evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 \n20(e), \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d is inapplicable. \nApplicant has reduced his total indebtedness by approximately $3,000 by satisfying \nthe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e. However, he provided no evidence supporting his \ncontention that he has begun satisfying the other debts. Consequently, although he \ndeserves credit for initiating a good-faith effort to satisfy his delinquent indebtedness, it \nremains unclear whether he is currently adhering to a plan to repay creditors. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and Is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is only partially applicable. The \nremaining mitigating conditions are not relevant to Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant deserves credit for acknowledging that his irresponsibility led to his\nfinancial problems. Also, he deserves credit for satisfying the debt alleged in subparagraph \n1.e. Conversely, whatever progress he has made satisfying the other debts is unclear, as \nhe provided no evidence supporting his contention that he has begun satisfying any of the \nother SOR debts after he satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 27, 2022 (Answer), and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2023. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on March 24, 2023, \nscheduling the matter for a hearing on May 9, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through H, without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record \nopen until May 23, 2023, and granted her an extension until July 6, 2023, so that she \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncould submit additional documentation. She timely submitted documentation that I \nmarked collectively as AE I and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on June 1, 2023.  \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant worked as a program area administrator \nfor a DOD contractor since 2012. She retired from employment in August 2023. Despite \nher retirement, \u00b6 4.41 of the Directive provides that jurisdiction in this matter continues \nsince the hearing was already completed.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. She is 66 years old. She married in 1980 \nand has been widowed since 2006. She has three adult children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1982. She has owned her home since 1987. (Tr. at 6-7, 25-27, 31; GE 1; AE \nA) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant worked as a program area administrator \nfor a DOD contractor since 2012. She worked only part time from 2014 to September \n2022, and then she worked full time until her retirement in August 2023. She also worked \nas a self-employed beauty consultant since 2011. She previously worked for the same \nDOD contractor beginning in 2002, except for a period of unemployment from \napproximately May 2009 to December 2009. She worked full time for a temporary agency \nfrom 2010 to 2012. She was first granted a security clearance in approximately 2006. (Tr. \nat 5, 7, 26-32, 42, 51-52, 59-61, 64; GE 1-3; AE A)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns, \nas required, for tax years (TY) 2011 through 2018, and that they remained unfiled as of \nthe date of the SOR. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleged that she failed to timely file her state \nincome tax returns, as required, for tax years 2011 and 2013 through 2018, and that they \nremained unfiled as of the date of the SOR. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) The SOR allegations are \nestablished by her admissions in her Answer; her 2020 security clearance application \n(SCA); her interviews with an authorized DOD investigator in 2020; and her 2021 \nresponse to interrogatories. (Answer; GE 1-3)  \nApplicant attributed her failure to file her income tax returns to the financial \nchallenges that began with the death of her spouse in 2006 and that continued when she \nbecame a caregiver for her parents and best friend. In 2008, she assisted her mother with \ncaring for her ill father until his death in 2011. To relieve some of her financial obligations \nafter his death, she began her home-based cosmetics business that year. The exhaustion \nof caregiving, the responsibility of managing her husband\u2019s estate, and her grief and \ndepression following his death hampered her ability to organize her supporting business \nreceipts and other necessary tax-related documentation. Her disorganization continued \nwith subsequent tax years, and she mistakenly believed that she needed to first file her \nolder income tax returns before she could file her more recent ones. She also suffers from \nattention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which further affected her ability to focus on details \nand important matters.

In 2017, Applicant helped care for her friend, who was \ndiagnosed with cancer, until her friend\u2019s death in 2018. In 2020, Applicant\u2019s mother had \na stroke and Applicant cared for her mother until her death in 2022, shortly after she was \nalso diagnosed with cancer. After making the funeral arrangements and settling her \nmother\u2019s estate, she suffered from depression. As she slowly regained focus for her job \nand to begin to resolve her outstanding income tax returns, she briefly listed her home for \nsale, from around April 2022 to October 2022, to downsize. She ultimately took her home \noff the market due to the lack of interest and the change in market conditions. Her efforts \nwere further delayed when she caught COVID in October 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 37-39, \n42-43, 45-48, 55-57, 59-60; GE 1-3; AE C, G, I) \nApplicant assumed she was due tax refunds for the tax years in which she did not \nfile an income tax return because she never received any communication from the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding any tax liability. When she received notice from \nthe state tax authority that she owed state income taxes for TY 2012, she made monthly \npayments of $150 for 22 months, beginning in 2019, and she paid her outstanding state \ntaxes of approximately $5,926 for that tax year in 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 37-39, 42-43, 45-\n48, 55-57, 59-60; GE 1-3; AE C, G, I) \nIn approximately 2019, Applicant began working with a tax professional. With his \nassistance, she filed her federal and state income tax return for TY 2019 in October 2020, \nwith an approved IRS tax extension. She was due a federal and state tax refund of $22 \nand $651, respectively, for that tax year. In October 2022, the tax professional prepared \nher federal income tax returns for TY 2011 through 2018, however, he did so without the \nbenefit of her business expenses or a W-2 form to prepare her state income tax returns. \nShe had to compile such information before the income tax returns for those tax years \ncould be filed. (Answer; Tr. at 36-37, 44, 47-48, 53-59, 61-62, 67-69; GE 1, 3; AE C, G, I) \nUpon the advice of the tax professional, Applicant prioritized and filed her most \nrecent federal and state income tax returns, for TY 2020, 2021, and 2022, in April 2023, \nso that she could obtain the refunds to which she was due. She expected a federal income \ntax refund totaling $118 and a state income tax refund totaling $2,873 for those tax years. \nWith the help of the tax professional, she compiled her business expenses and filed her \n2011 through 2018 federal income tax returns in June 2023. She owed federal income \ntaxes totaling $10,681 for those tax years. Since this tax debt was not alleged in the SOR, \nI will not consider this evidence for disqualification purposes, but I may use it as it relates \nto credibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-person factors. She did not provide \ndocumentation reflecting that she filed her state income tax returns for TY 2011 and 2013 \nthrough 2018. She testified that the state tax authority had not contacted her concerning \nher unfiled state income tax returns. (Tr. at 32-36, 39-42, 44, 47-48, 53-59, 61-62, 67-69; \nGE 1, 3; AE C, G, I) \nApplicant\u2019s annual income as of the date of the hearing was approximately \n$70,000. When she worked only part time from 2014 to September 2022, her annual \nincome was approximately $60,000.

Since 2020, she \nhas worked to reduce her overall debt and improve her credit ratings. Her credit reports \nfrom 2023 reflect a \u201cvery good\u201d credit rating. She does not have any delinquent debts. \nThe tax professional provided her with financial counseling, in addition to helping her with \nher taxes. She stated that she lived modestly and within her financial means. She has \ndeveloped a system to stay on top of her business expenses and she intends to timely \nfile her future income tax returns. (Tr. at 27-30, 42-43, 48-53, 57-59, 62-63; GE 3-5; AE \nC, D, E, F, H, I) \nIn May 2022, an individual who served as Applicant\u2019s assistant supervisor for \nseveral years and supervisor for six months, described Applicant as a \u201cvery detail-\noriented person with high standards to get the work done in a professional manner.\u201d This \nindividual attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. In June 2023, \na work colleague of over 15 years also attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and strong \nwork ethic. (AE B, I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for TY 2011 through \n2018. She also failed to timely file her state income tax returns for TY 2011 and 2013 \nthrough 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. \nNonetheless, under AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly \nunder her circumstances. She did not begin working with a tax professional until 2019. \nAlthough this individual provided her with financial counseling in addition to helping her \nfile her income tax returns, she only recently filed her federal income tax returns for 2011 \nthrough 2018 in June 2023. Moreover, she owes federal income taxes totaling $10,681 \nfor those tax years. She also failed to provide documentation reflecting that she filed her \nstate income tax returns for TY 2011 and 2013 through 2018. She needs more time to \nestablish that she has her finances under control. I find that these financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. \nWithout objection, Items 3 through 7, and AE A through C, are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 33, is unmarried and has no children. She attended college from \napproximately August 2011 through April 2013 without earning a degree. She has been \nemployed as a correctional officer by her state since September 2022. She previously \nworked there from November 2016 through August 2021. The record indicates that \nApplicant had more than one sponsor associated with the SCA, which is her first \napplication for a security clearance. In her FORM response, she indicated that \nemployment with her current sponsor is pending the successful adjudication of her \nsecurity clearance. The interim security clearance she was granted sometime in 2021 \nwas withdrawn in about June 2022, presumably in connection with the issuance of the \nSOR. (Item 3; Item 5 at 17-18; AE A, C) \nApplicant worked in the retail and food service industry from February 2008 \nthrough November 2016. She was employed full time from February 2008 through \nOctober 2010 when she relocated to attend community college. She remained \nunemployed until she began a full-time position in March 2012, which she left in January \n2015 for a reason identified as a \u201clocation change.\u201d Applicant began a part-time position \nwith Employer A at the beginning of May 2015 that continued until November 2016. She \nended a full-time position with Employer B at the end of May 2015. She was able to work \nconcurrently for Employers A and B in May 2015 because she worked her full-time \nposition in the mornings and the part-time position in the evenings. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2, \n5; AE C) \nThe record was confusing about Applicant\u2019s employment status between January \n2015 and May 2015. Applicant did not disclose Employer B in her SCA. During her March \n2021 security clearance interview (SI), she reported working for Employer B from May \n2015 through November 2016. However, in a May 2022 response to DOHA-issued \ninterrogatories, she indicated that the timeline she gave the investigator for Employer B \nwas incorrect, but only corrected the end date and not the start date. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2, \n5; AE C) \nThe record was also unclear about Applicant\u2019s employment status between August \n2021 and September 2022. Applicant provided a December 31, 2021 paystub indicating \nthat she had been employed by Employer C for several months. In her September 2022 \nFORM response, she reported a period of unemployment between about June and \nSeptember 2022. The record is otherwise silent on the issue. (Item 5 at 17-18) \nThe SOR alleged 25 debts, including a $7,398 car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), eight federal \nstudent loans totaling $23,978 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.h, and 1.l) and 11 medical accounts \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntotaling $3,561 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r \u2013 1.y). In her Answer, Applicant admitted \neach of the SOR allegations. \nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to each question about her financial record and did not \notherwise disclose any delinquent debts in her SCA. During her SI, she initially answered \n\u201cno\u201d to whether she had any financial delinquencies in the past seven years. After being \nconfronted by the investigator with debts from her February 2021 credit bureau report \n(CBR), which were also alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.y, Applicant recognized some \nof the creditors and disputed others. She admitted that she was notified about a week or \ntwo prior to the SI about SOR \u00b6 1.p but denied prior knowledge that any other debts were \nin delinquent status. (Item 3 at 29-30; Item 4 at 6-9) \nApplicant acknowledged the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a but did not consider it in \ndelinquent status because she had been paying $100 per month to the creditor. She \nintended to continue those payments until the debt was settled by her insurance \ncompany. The loan related to a car that was totaled in an August 2019 accident, which \nshe described as a 20-car pile-up on the freeway. She was not the cause of the accident. \n(Item 4 at 7, 8) \nApplicant acknowledged that she defaulted on the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.h and 1.l but did not indicate the circumstances of the default. She did not \nconsider the loans in delinquent status because she had been making payments via an \nautomatic payroll deduction, which was halted due to COVID-19. She referenced her \nwages being garnished, but the record did not otherwise establish that the deduction was \ninvoluntary. She planned to contact the creditor to investigate the status of her accounts. \nShe had no intent to default on her loans and planned to resume payments. (Item 4 at 8, \n10). \nApplicant denied that she was responsible for SOR \u00b6 1.i, which was a charge for \ndamage to the common area of her college dormitory. She attributed the damage solely \nto her roommates. She intended to dispute the debt the following day. She would only \npay the debt if she were required to do so. Any such payment would be done via a \npayment plan. (Item 4 at 7-8) \nApplicant denied any knowledge that SOR \u00b6 1.j was in collection status prior to the \nday of the SI. She attributed the debt to her sister\u2019s cell phone. Although Applicant\u2019s plan \nincluded her sister\u2019s phone, her sister apparently agreed to make the payments \nassociated with her sister\u2019s phone. Unbeknownst to Applicant, her sister lost the phone \nand fell behind with her payments. She planned to contact the creditor the following week \nto set up a payment plan to begin at the end of March. (Item 4 at 7) \nApplicant did not recognize the medical accounts or creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.o, \nand 1.r through 1.y. She denied having any delinquent medical accounts because she \nhad medical insurance and never received any bills for medical treatment. She \nrecognized that the SOR \u00b6 1.m creditor was the hospital to where she was sent via \nambulance following the August 2019 accident but denied owing them any money. As of \nthe SI, she did not have any then existing injuries from the accident.

She was not able to pay it right away nor had she previously \nknown how much she owed. She planned to contact the creditor the following week to set \nup a payment plan to begin at the end of March 2021. She attributed her delay in resolving \nthis debt to not being smart with her finances at the time. Applicant did not explain what \nshe meant by that statement. The record did not otherwise indicate that she had been \nirresponsible with respect to her finances. (Item 4 at 7) \nApplicant recognized SOR \u00b6 1.p as a carpet cleaning fee that she incurred at a \nformer apartment due to having a dog. At some point prior to the SI, she made a verbal \nagreement with the creditor to resolve the debt via monthly payments of $50, beginning \nat the end of March 2021. (Item 4 at 6) \nApplicant acknowledged that she had car insurance with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.q \nbut denied owing any delinquent balances because she made her monthly payments via \nautomatic payment. (Item 4 at 7) \nAfter discussing the debts with which she was confronted, Applicant affirmed that \nno other circumstances were involved besides those she explained. She characterized \nher financial situation as okay. She asserted that she was actively trying to improve her \nfinancial wellbeing. She had begun budgeting differently, obtained a new job, and working \na lot of overtime. She believed that these actions would allow her to avoid financial \ndifficulties in the future. She planned to resolve any legitimate debts and expressed her \nintent to provide financial documents to the investigator at a later date. (Item 4 at 8-9) \nAfter the SI, Applicant provided three documents to the investigator related to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.r. and 1.q. A February 23, 2021 letter confirmed that, because of her \ncooperation, the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor agreed to settle the debt for $7,500 to be paid in \nmonthly installments of $100, beginning February 26, 2021. A March 5, 2021 letter \nconfirmed that she agreed to pay $44.49 per month, beginning March 30, 2021, to resolve \nSOR \u00b6 1.r. The SOR \u00b6 1.q creditor confirmed via a March 12, 2021 letter that two $25 \npayments were scheduled to be paid on March 30, 2021 and April 30, 2021. The record \ndid not address whether the two payments were part of a larger settlement or resolved \nSOR \u00b6 1.q in full. (Item 4 at 12-14) \nThe CAF issued interrogatories to Applicant on January 11, 2022. In response, \nshe explained that she fell behind on bills due to \u201cperiods of times in my life where I fell \non hard times;\u201d and asserted, \u201cI am able to work a job that will allow me to pay my debts \noff in a timely manner.\u201d She included in her response three documents, including a \nduplicate of the SOR \u00b6 1.a. letter previously provided to the investigator. A December 31, \n2021 paystub showed a $1,954 net pay for the period of December 13, 2021 through \nDecember 26, 2021, and a $6,837 year-to-date net pay for an unspecified period.

In response, \nshe asserted that she was still making the monthly payments towards SOR \u00b6 1.a, which \nhad reduced the balance to $5,900.

(Item 4 at 2) \nIn her Answer, Applicant stated that she had been making consistent payments to \nreduce the balance of debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a to $5,000 and continued to work with the agency \nshe hired in January 2022 to dispute the $2,265 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.i. She \nasserted that the agency helped her dispute and delete from her CBRs the $1,881 \ncollection account in SOR \u00b6 1.j, the $840 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.n, and $758 \nmedical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o.

She did not proffer any documents. \nNor did she provide an explanation or status update concerning her student loans, the \n$938 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, or the $388 car insurance account in SOR \u00b6 1.q. She \nconcluded by stating: \nI am dedicated to working on paying off my debt and understand that it is \nnot just necessary to keep my security clearance but to better myself. My \njob is my livelihood and how I am able to maintain and continue to work on\npaying off my debt. I take pride in the work I do and would like to continue \nfor as long as I can. \n \nIn her September 2022 FORM response, Applicant acknowledged that she \ndefaulted on some of the payment plans she established and fell behind on some bills \ndue to her recent period of unemployment (from approximately June 2022 through \nSeptember 2022) caused by the withdrawal of her interim security clearance. She did not \nprovide further details. She obtained a new job to help her catch up on her bills and \nresume her payment plans. She continued to engage the services of the agency that she \nhired in January 2022 to assist her. She provided a September 3, 2022 letter that \nconfirmed the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor received payments totaling $1,600, which reduced her \nbalance to $5,900 and that her next scheduled payment was due on September 30, 2022. \n(AE A-C) \nA February 2021 CBR confirmed each of the SOR debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, \n1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q were reported on her January 2022 CBR. The 2021 CBR indicated \nthat the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r went to collections after the 2019 \naccident, while those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s. through 1.y went to collections before the accident. \nThe 2021 CBR noted Applicant\u2019s dispute of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.r. through 1.y; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe 2022 CBR noted Applicant\u2019s dispute of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.p. and 1.q. The 2022 \nCBR revealed no new delinquent debts and that she was current in her monthly payments \nof $30 and $25 per month for two credit cards opened in September 2021 with credit limits \nof $300 and $200. (Items 6, 7) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe 2019 accident that totaled Applicant\u2019s vehicle was beyond her control. The \nrelated car loan was her largest single debt. Despite not being at fault in the accident, she \nresponsibly negotiated a settlement to repay the loan in February 2021. By September \n2022, she had made 16 $100 payments. Given the dates involved, the majority of the \nmedical SOR debts appear related to the accident. Those that went to collections before \nthe accident (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s. through 1.y) totaled only $129. \nApplicant had reasonable bases to dispute SOR \u00b6 1.i and all the medical SOR \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r through 1.y). Her roommates caused the damage \nfor which she was being charged. She had health insurance and never received any bills \nfor medical treatment. She took action to resolve these disputes. Although SOR \u00b6 1.i and \none of the medical debts (SOR \u00b6 1.m) appeared on her 2022 CBR, her disputes were \nnoted therein. Her dispute of SOR \u00b6 1.i was also noted on the 2021 CBR. \nApplicant did not proffer any bases to dispute SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.n, or 1.p. She accepted \nresponsibility for repaying her cell phone bill regardless of the agreement she had with \nher sister. She acknowledged that she owed past-due rent when she broke her lease and \na carpet cleaning fee due to having a dog. During the SI, she expressed an intent to \nresolve each of these debts. In fact, she set up a payment plan for SOR \u00b6 1.p prior to the \nSI. However, she did not proffer any evidence that she made any payments towards these \ndebts. \nDefaulting on any loan is security significant. The fact that Applicant defaulted on \nher federal student loans is of particular concern because she is seeking to gain a DOD \nclearance, which is a federal benefit. I, sua sponte, took administrative notice of the fact \nthat, beginning March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of \nEducation has been providing emergency relief for federal student loans, including the \nsuspension of loan payments and collections on defaulted loans. On August 24, 2022, \nPresident Biden extended this COVID-19 relief through December 31, 2022. On \nNovember 22, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education announced an extension of the \npause on federal student loan repayment, interest, and collections, to sometime in 2023. \nThis pause mitigates Applicant\u2019s post-pandemic inaction on her student loans. However, \nshe acknowledged that she defaulted on her student loans prior to COVID-19. Because \nthe record was insufficient to establish that her pre-pandemic payroll deductions resulted \nfrom an involuntary wage garnishment, I consider them sufficient evidence of a good-faith \neffort to resolve her student loans. She has demonstrated, through her consistent \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments towards SOR \u00b6 1.a, that she will follow through with her promise to resume her \nstudent loan payments. \nThe record indicated that the agency Applicant hired in January 2022 is only \nassisting her with repairing her credit reports, not with paying debts or establishing \npayment plans. However, in addition to her budgeting differently and working overtime, \nthe fact that she sought assistance from the agency demonstrates her commitment to \nimproving her financial wellbeing. Moreover, her 2022 credit report revealed that, despite \nperiods of unemployment that may have impacted her ability to repay existing delinquent \ndebts, she avoided incurring any new debts and managed her current finances \nresponsibly. Both before and after the SOR was issued, she demonstrated a track record \nof responsible action that leads me to conclude that she will follow through with her plans \nto fully resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a and repay her student loans. I do not find the unresolved debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.n, and 1.p., which total $3,456, security significant considering the record \nas a whole. However, Applicant should be aware that, unless she has a reasonable basis \nto dispute a debt, the mere deletion of a debt from her credit report is not generally \nsufficient on its own mitigate the security concern associated with that debt. \nThe AGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay every debt \nalleged in the SOR, or to be debt free. Applicant implemented a plan to address the SOR \ndebts and has made meaningful progress implementing that plan. None of her debts \nresulted from irresponsible spending. I conclude that her indebtedness is under control, \nunlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt about her reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe debts alleged in the SOR.

He did well until the market in which he conducted business became too saturated with competitor tow- truck drivers.

Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Government alleged that Applicant had failed to pay his Federal tax liabilities for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR 1.a). He owes approximately $90,908 in delinquent taxes. The SOR sets forth a second allegation stating that Applicant is indebted to his local tax authority in the approximate amount of $2,028 for delinquent taxes for TYs 2016 through 2021. In the Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations. The current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: 1.a Failure to pay Federal tax in the approximate amount of $90,908. While operating his tow-truck business, Applicant fell behind in tax year (TY) 2016 on his Federal taxes related to his business.",

(Answer.) The Government was ready to proceed \non August 15, 2022. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2022. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 3, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled via TEAMS video conference on November 3, \n2022. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I held the record open \nuntil November 17, 2022, to give Applicant the opportunity to supplement the record with \nadditional documentation. He timely submitted three sets of documents, which I marked \nas Applicant Exhibits (AE ) A through C. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non November 10, 2022. (Tr. at 13-18, 64.) \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant is 49 years old, married and has no children. He graduated from high \nschool in 1992. He owned a tow-truck business for a number of years. He did well until \nthe market in which he conducted business became too saturated with competitor tow-\ntruck drivers. \nHe closed his business and began working for a U.S. Government \ncontractor in June 2020 as a maintenance technician. He is a first-time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. at 20-23, 37-39; GE 1 at 8, 12-19, 21-23.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore \npotentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. The Government alleged that Applicant had failed to pay his Federal tax \nliabilities for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR 1.a). He owes approximately \n$90,908 in delinquent taxes. The SOR sets forth a second allegation stating that Applicant \nis indebted to his local tax authority in the approximate amount of $2,028 for delinquent \ntaxes for TYs 2016 through 2021. In the Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations. \nThe current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a Failure to pay Federal tax in the approximate amount of $90,908. While \noperating his tow-truck business, Applicant fell behind in tax year (TY) 2016 on his \nFederal taxes related to his business. He acknowledges that he tried to ignore the \nproblem, but his tax debts did not go away. Over the subsequent two years, his delinquent \ntax debt increased to at least $90,000 because he was not paying any withholding taxes \nor quarterly payments on his income from his business. As a first-time business owner, \nhe claims that he did not know what he was doing when it came to his tax responsibilities. \nIn 2020 he hired a tax consultant who negotiated with the IRS an expensive payment plan \nto pay the delinquent taxes monthly over a number of years. Applicant was dissatisfied \nthat his advisor did not seek a compromise of the debt that would lower his tax debt.

Applicant wants to contact the IRS and seek a settlement in compromise that he can \nafford. \nApplicant and his wife together earn $200,000, but they live in an area with high \nliving costs. They live paycheck-to-paycheck and have little left over after paying their \nmonthly expenses and debts. Applicant\u2019s debts include monthly payments of about $700 \ndue on a new vehicle he purchased in 2020 and payments on a loan used to purchase a \ncamping trailer. Applicant and his wife are increasing their credit-cards debts to pay their \nliving and very high commuting expenses. Applicant recognizes that he has \u201cto step up \nand dig [himself] out of this hole.\u201d With his wife\u2019s income and expenses, their net monthly \nincome after all expenses gives them insufficient funds to make any significant payment \non Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes. (Tr. at 23-24, 37-40, 49-50, 53, 57-59; GE 1 at 32-33; \nGE 2 at 3-8; GE 4 at 3; AE A.) \nThe IRS diverted a recent Federal tax refund for $11,748 to pay down taxes \nApplicant owes for TY 2016. His bookkeeper filed for an extension for the filing of his TY \n2021 tax returns. As of the hearing date, he was late in filing the tax return. He recognizes \nthat he has to complete and file the return. He believes he has overpaid his taxes and \nwould receive a refund if he did not have a debt to the IRS for back taxes. As an employee, \nhe has withholding taken out of every paycheck and does not expect to have increased \ntax problems in the future. Applicant\u2019s delinquent Federal income tax debt has not been \nresolved. (Tr. at 34, 41-43, 59; AE C.) \n1.b Failure to pay local taxes for TY 2016 through 2021 in the amount of about \n$2,028. Applicant asserts that he paid this debt in late 2021. After the hearing he provided \ndocumentary proof of payment. He may owe a small amount of current taxes, but he is \nnot delinquent on these taxes at this time. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 25-34; GE 2 at 11; \nAE C.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nBoth of these conditions have application under the facts of this case. Applicant has been \ndelinquent on paying his Federal income taxes since TY 2016 and his tax debt \nsignificantly increased in TYs 2017 and 2018. The evidence establishes that in 2021 he \nhas paid a relatively small local tax debt. These facts shift the burden to Applicant to \nprovide mitigation of the security concerns raised by his actions. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the above Guideline F mitigating conditions fully applies. In 2020 Applicant \nreceived counseling and assistance from a credible and legitimate source to negotiate a \npayment plan with the IRS, but he was unable to make the payments under the payment \nplan. The problem has not been resolved. Applicant has not since made alternative \narrangements with the IRS nor has he initiated a good-faith effort to pay his Federal tax \ndebt. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has unpaid Federal taxes of at least $91,000 dating back to the 2016-to-TY \n2018 period. His tax obligations arose in the first instance for reasons within his control, \nspecifically his failure to pay any withholding or estimated taxes out of the income he was \nearning operating his towing business. In 2020 a tax advisor negotiated a payment plan \nfor Applicant to repay his taxes over time, but Applicant could not afford to pay it due to \nhis other financial obligations. \nApplicant has taken no responsible steps since then to seek a resolution of his \ndelinquent taxes. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been \nresolved. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \neligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has not met his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 47, has been married since 2014. He has two sons, ages 15 and 17, and two adult stepsons. He graduated from high school in 1993. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since June 2013, and listed no periods of unemployment in his June 2021 SCA. He has held a DOD security clearance since approximately 2019. (Items 3, 4) The SOR alleged that Applicant has three delinquent consumer debts totaling approximately $21,910 and one delinquent $1,495 medical debt. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c; however, I construed his explanations for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as de facto denials, because he indicated these debts no longer appear on his \u201ccredit history.\u201d He denied SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Items 1-2) Applicant attributed his financial problems largely to purchasing his home in June 2011. \u201cI bought [a] house [and] couldn\u2019t afford anything else so I started to charge things and before I knew it I was to (sic) far behind to catch up, most of this is late fees and interest.

He has two sons, ages 15 and \n17, and two adult stepsons. He graduated from high school in 1993. He has worked for \nhis current employer, a defense contractor, since June 2013, and listed no periods of \nunemployment in his June 2021 SCA. He has held a DOD security clearance since \napproximately 2019. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has three delinquent consumer debts totaling \napproximately $21,910 and one delinquent $1,495 medical debt. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.c; however, I construed his explanations for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as de facto \ndenials, because he indicated these debts no longer appear on his \u201ccredit history.\u201d He \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Items 1-2) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems largely to purchasing his home in June \n2011. \n\u201cI bought [a] house [and] couldn\u2019t afford anything else so I started to charge \nthings and before I knew it I was to (sic) far behind to catch up, most of this \nis late fees and interest. I tried to work things out, but they wouldn\u2019t take $10 \na week they wanted $100s and I couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d (Items 3, 7) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was opened in 2004, and it was charged off in the \namount of $12,840 in November 2021. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was opened in \nAugust 2016, and it was placed for collection in the amount of $7,055 in December 2021. \nIn Applicant\u2019s November 2021 response to CAF interrogatories, he indicated he had not \npaid or resolved either of these debts. Neither debt appear on his August 2022 credit \nbureau report (CBR), but he provided no documentation demonstrating he paid, resolved, \nor disputed them. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 3-4) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was opened in October 2017, and it was placed for \ncollection in the amount of $2,015 in November 2021. In Applicant\u2019s November 2021 \nresponse to CAF interrogatories, he indicated that he had not paid or resolved this debt. \nIn his Answer, he admitted the debt, and it appears on his August 2022 CBR with an \noutstanding balance of $2,059. He provided no documentation demonstrating he paid or \nresolved it. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 4) \nThe medical account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was opened in October 2017, and it \nwas placed for collection in the amount of $1,495 in November 2021. In Applicant\u2019s \nNovember 2021 response to CAF interrogatories, he indicated that he had not paid or \nresolved this debt. In his Answer, he denied the debt and claimed the creditor \u201cdid not \nuse the proper medical code.\u201d This debt does not appear on his August 2022 CBR. (Item \n2; Item 4; Item 6 at 2-3; Item 7 at 4) \nIn November 2021, Applicant\u2019s annual salary was approximately $90,200, and he \nwas the sole income earner for his family. His net monthly remainder was $245 and did \nnot include payments toward the debts alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence in the \nrecord that he has received credit counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $23,000 in delinquent debt. There is no evidence in the record \nthat he has experienced unemployment or another hardship, and his only explanation for \nhis financial problems is due to purchasing his home in 2011. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d do not appear on his most recent CBR; however, \naccording to Appeal Board jurisprudence, Applicant is responsible for providing \nreasonably available corroborating documentation to show debt resolution. The record is \nabsent any evidence of an effort by him to resolve his debts or prove that the outstanding \ndebts are not his responsibility. Accordingly, there is insufficient that he has acted \nresponsibly to resolve his financial issues. Nor is there evidence of a good-faith effort to \nrepay or resolve his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve his debts indicates his financial issues are an ongoing \nand continuing concern. Therefore, his behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. For the forgoing reasons, Applicant failed to \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He \ndid not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns or establish his eligibility \nfor a security clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He is 40 years old. He married in 2016 \nand divorced in 2018. He has one child. He earned his high school diploma in 2000. He \nserved in the National Guard from 2002 to 2011, when he was honorably discharged. \nHe attended college from 2015 to 2016 but did not earn a degree. He has worked for \nvarious DOD contractors since 2002, except when he worked part time for a university \nfrom 2005 to 2006. He was also unemployed from August 2007 to November 2007, and \nfrom July 2018 to October 2018. As of his December 2020 background interview, he \nhad worked as a desk manager for his employer, a DOD contractor, since May 2020. \nHe was first granted a security clearance in 2006. (Items 1-6) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant had four delinquent student \nloans totaling $11,082 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d); seven delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$6,518 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.k); $251 in child support arrears (SOR \u00b6 1.l); and two judgments, \nfrom 2011 and 2016, for $12,019 and $5,721, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.n). The \nallegations are established by his admissions in his Answer, a March 2018 security \nclearance application (SCA), a December 2020 background interview, his responses to \ninterrogatories from August 2021 and April 2022, court records, and three credit bureau \nreports from October 2020 to February 2022. (Items 1-7, 9-11) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts primarily to his youth. He also incurred \nhis debts while attending school, during his periods of unemployment, or when he \nearned minimal income. He also cited his divorce as a contributing factor. He earned a \nminimal income when he was ordered in 2009 to pay $1,006 monthly in child support, \nand he could not always fulfill this obligation. His tax refunds have been intercepted \nyearly and applied to his child support arrears, and he intended to address his \ndelinquent debts after he resolved his arrears. (Items 2-5) \nA May 2022 payment summary reflects that Applicant has been paying his child \nsupport obligation in SOR \u00b6 1.l since at least July 2021. He stated that he paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.d, 1.j, and 1.n, and that he was paying SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.k, but he did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his claims. He did not provide any information \nabout the status of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, or 1.i. He stated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m are older \nthan seven years, and although he made attempts to address these debts, he did not \nfeel obligated to continue to do so as he expected them to be removed from his credit \nbureau reports given their age. (Items 2-5) \nApplicant\u2019s August 2021 personal financial statement reflects a net monthly \nincome of $3,076, and a net monthly remainder of $537 after expenses. It does not \nreflect payments to any of the SOR debts, except for his child support obligation in SOR \n\u00b6 1.l. The most recent credit bureau report from October 2022 does not reflect any \ndelinquent debts. There is no evidence that he received any credit counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying his \ndebts. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(d) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He has made payments to his child support obligation in SOR \u00b6 1.l \nsince at least July 2021, before the SOR. I therefore find that allegation in his favor. \nAlthough Applicant indicated that he paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.j, and 1.n, \nand that he was paying SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.k, he did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate his claims. He did not provide any information about the status of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.f, or 1.i. Moreover, he stated that he did not feel obligated to resolve the older \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m, and he intended to wait for these debts to fall off his credit \nbureau report. It is reasonable for an administrative judge to expect an applicant to \npresent documentary evidence showing resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). Merely waiting for a debt to drop off a \ncredit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s favor. See, e.g, \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). That some debts have dropped \noff an applicant\u2019s credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. ISCR Case \nNo. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016). He has not received financial counseling. I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old. He married in 2003 and has one child. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2010, except for periods of unemployment for three months in 2013 and from November 2011 to January 2013, when he worked for a commercial business. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since August 2019.

I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. Applicant and \nfour witnesses testified. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G. There \nwere no objections to any exhibits offered in evidence and all were admitted. The record \nwas held open until January 17, 2023, to permit Applicant to provide additional \ndocuments, which he did. They are marked AE H through L and are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 18, 2023. \nAt Applicant\u2019s hearing, I confirmed with Applicant, his counsel, and Department \nCounsel that they were aware that I was the administrative judge that presided over \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 hearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel had represented him in the earlier hearing. \nI offered to recuse myself from conducting the present hearing and both sides stated on \nthe record they had no objection to me presiding over the present hearing. (Transcript \n(Tr.) 6) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h with explanations. \nHe denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. He married in 2003 and has one child. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1993. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2010, except \nfor periods of unemployment for three months in 2013 and from November 2011 to \nJanuary 2013, when he worked for a commercial business. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a federal contractor, since August 2019. (Tr. 17) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d alleged alcohol-related conduct from January 2007 \nthrough October 2009, which Applicant testified about during his 2012 hearing. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel stated he did not intend to rehash this information, standing on the \nprior testimony and findings of fact. (Tr. 22) I have incorporated my findings of fact for \nthose allegations from my earlier decision as stated below. They are verbatim from my \ndecision. (GE 6) The SOR allegations in the earlier decision are as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that in about January 2007, Applicant resigned from \nemployment because he had used a company laptop to view pornography while he was \nunder the influence of alcohol and on temporary duty with his employment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that after seven days of inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse in \nabout July 2007, Applicant declined to follow his treatment provider\u2019s advice to enroll in \nan intensive outpatient program (IOP). He did not attend the IOP until March 2008. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that in about September 2009, Applicant received inpatient \ntreatment for alcohol abuse for about 17 days. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged that in about October 2009, Applicant overindulged in alcohol \nduring a business trip to a foreign country and failed to attend any meetings during an \nentire week. He was fired from his job soon thereafter. \nThe following findings of facts below relate to the above allegations that were \naddressed during Applicant\u2019s first hearing and are also alleged on his later SOR. \nApplicant did not struggle with alcohol abuse until approximately 2006. Around that \ntime, his employer initiated an investigation into suspicious activity regarding Applicant\u2019s \ncompany\u2019s laptop computer. He was on administrative leave for six weeks until the \ninvestigation was completed. Specifically, the investigation involved Applicant allegedly \naccessing pornography on the computer. He admitted to surfing the web and accessing \nadult pornography. The investigation also revealed there were seven to eight personal \nphotos of a sexual nature on his computer. \nApplicant was devastated. While he was at home on administrative leave, he \nworried and began to drink alcohol during the mornings and afternoons. He was permitted \nto return to his work facility but could not have access to the government network. He \nbecame frustrated and continued to drink alcohol. In approximately December 2006, the \ninvestigation was completed. In January 2007, the results of the investigation determined \nthat Applicant was surfing the internet for adult pornography on his company computer, \nand there were some private personal photos also on the computer. His employer gave \nhim the option to resign or be terminated. He chose to resign. His wife was aware of his \ninappropriate use of his computer. \nApplicant looked for a new job and continued to drink alcohol. He was hired in \napproximately March or April 2007 and worked until July 2007. In June 2007, he was \nadvised that his security clearance was reinstated. During this period of time, he \ncontinued to drink alcohol, but stated his consumption was reduced. \nApplicant was aware at this point that his drinking had become problematic. He \nthought he needed professional help. He sought help from the county mental-health \ncenter for depression and alcohol consumption. He was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser. \nHe received some treatment but had to leave the facility because his health insurance \nwould not cover the cost of treatment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated he was aware that something in his life had to change, and in July \n2007, he received inpatient treatment at an alcohol treatment center and was diagnosed \nwith alcohol withdrawal and dependence. He voluntarily sought this treatment. The \nnormal course of inpatient treatment is 14 to 28 days. Applicant\u2019s health insurance would \nonly pay for eight to nine days. He was isolated from external factors while he was an \ninpatient, so he progressed through treatment. He was discharged and went back to work \nwith his former employer. He was told by the treatment counselor to participate in the \nfollow-up outpatient program. He attended a couple of Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings and some of the program\u2019s aftercare sessions, but he did not participate \nregularly or consistently in either. He casually began to resume drinking alcohol and did \nnot perceive he was having any problems. He stated he did not consume alcohol for two \nand half weeks after his discharge. \nFrom January 2008 to June 2009, Applicant received treatment from the state \npsychiatric services for depression and alcohol dependence. The treatment consisted of \na six-week IOP, follow-up meetings with a physician and weekly aftercare meetings. \nApplicant admitted he participated only intermittently and discontinued at some point \nbecause he was back at work. \nIn August 2009, Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol began increasing. He had an \nincident at work where he failed to report for two days without telling his customer or \nemployer. He stayed out of work for a couple of more days while he arranged to go back \ninto treatment. His wife was unaware that he was staying home and not going to work. In \nSeptember 2009, he received inpatient treatment again and completed the full course of \ntreatment. He resumed drinking casually around October 2009 when he and his family \nwent on vacation. In November 2009, Applicant and a coworker traveled to a foreign \ncountry to provide two weeks of training to that country\u2019s military. Applicant participated \nin the first week of training. He began drinking alcohol the second week and made \nexcuses to his coworker that he was not feeling well enough to work. He would stay at \nthe hotel during the day and continue to drink alcohol. His employer learned of his actions, \nand he was terminated. \nApplicant was depressed and drinking. In February 2010, Applicant stated he got \nseriously involved in his recovery. He began looking for a job. He resumed his attendance \nof AA meetings and was working with a sponsor a couple of times a week. He admitted \nto himself he had a serious problem with alcohol dependence. Applicant stated he did not \ndrink any alcohol from February 2010 until May 2011. \nIn late April 2011, Applicant\u2019s community experienced a devastating tornado. \nBecause they were without electricity, they cooked on outdoor grills. On May 1, 2011, \nthey learned that the terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been killed. His neighbor brought out \na bottle of alcohol to pass around as a toast in celebration. Applicant stated he took a \nswig from the bottle. He stated he did not really think about it. His old pattern of thought \ncame to him, and he thought perhaps it was okay to have a drink now and again. He \nwrestled with whether to tell his AA sponsor. He decided to tell his sponsor and recommit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto the AA program. He credibly testified at his first hearing that he had not consumed any \nalcohol since May 1, 2011. \nApplicant admitted that he was stubborn about his recovery. He finally got to a \npoint where he got tired of his struggle with alcohol. He chose to live a life of principles \nand sobriety. He had the support of AA, his family, and his friends. It was an ongoing \nprocess. Applicant stated at his first hearing that although he was not consuming alcohol, \nhe had to pay attention every day and be mindful of his recovery. He had accepted that \nhe is an alcoholic. He attended AA meetings a couple of times a week. He talked to his \nsponsor. He helped organize and participated in meetings at the treatment center where \nhe attended. At that time, he attended at least two AA meetings a week sometimes he \nattended three to five meetings, depending on his schedule. He completed the 12-step \nprogram of AA and was continuing to work through the steps again. As he got further \naway from his last drink there was less of a daily struggle, but he continued to be vigilant. \nHe said he was committed to staying sober each day. Applicant stated: \nI\u2019d like to give you 100 percent assurances that I will never take a drink \nagain. And I feel the chances are very close to that if I continue to do what \nI\u2019ve become comfortable with doing on a daily basis and, you know, \npracticing these principles. And I\u2019ve got a good support system both AA \nbased and family and friend based. And I feel confident about that. \nApplicant\u2019s wife became aware that his drinking was becoming problematic and \nhis consumption was increasing. She was supportive in his sobriety and attended a three-\nday program for family members of alcoholics provided by his treatment center to educate \nher on how to help him with his sobriety and recovery. She also attended Al-Anon when \nshe felt she needed the support. She believed Applicant had difficulties believing he was \na good husband and father, and so he would drink. She was convinced her husband was \ncommitted to sobriety. He made a commitment to be employed and was fully vested in \nhis efforts to change his ways. She believed he now realized how much he lost and was \nremorseful about his past actions. She believed because he knew how much he had to \nlose, he would continue to remain sober. She noticed a significant change in him since \nhe acknowledged his problems and committed to sobriety. She and her husband were \ncommunicating better. She supported him when he wanted to go to AA meetings and \nnever questioned him in that regard. (GE 6) \nThe following facts are from Applicant\u2019s recent hearing. In his March 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed his 2007 seven-day inpatient alcohol \ntreatment and his 2008 six-week IOP follow-up for alcohol abuse. He further disclosed \nhis September 2009 inpatient alcohol treatment and counseling for 17 days. He disclosed \nthat in August 2019, he completed a 21-day inpatient alcohol and treatment counseling \nprogram and a follow up IOP for 12 session, each lasting three to four hours. He reported \nongoing attendance at a follow-up continuing care meeting once a week for an hour and \nthat he is participating in a 12-step recovery program.

He said that \nin 2014, his AA sponsor passed away and he did not obtain a new sponsor. In 2016, he \nstarted drinking again. From spring 2016 to October 2018, his alcohol consumption \nprogressed to where he was drinking daily. He testified that he was drinking daily between \na \u00bd pint and a fifth of liquor. He testified that he struggles with his drinking when he has \nchallenges. He would occasionally drink in the morning but would then not go to work. He \nwould sometimes stay away from work for a couple of days. He would occasionally leave \nwork early so he could drink. He would not drink at home. He said things had gotten very \nbad at work because his drinking was affecting his motivation. His wife was not aware of \nhis drinking. He would hide his liquor in the garage. (Tr. 25-27, 79-86; GE 3, 7) \nIn October 2018, he recognized he needed to get back on track with his sobriety. \nHe voluntarily enrolled in a four-day detoxification program. He told the investigator that \nhe was sober for about two months. He said he thought he just needed the detoxification \nprogram and a new AA sponsor, and he would be back on track. Applicant admitted at \nhis hearing that he left the detoxification program early. Post-hearing, he later clarified \nthat it was because his insurance would only authorize payment for four days. He was \nencouraged by the staff to stay, but he left against their medical advice. The discharge \nsummary notes that he did not want to stay in the program beyond the four days. He said \nhe was leaving due to commitments to family, work, and his long-term AA program outside \nof the medical facility. In December 2018, he went on a cruise and started drinking again. \nHe began increasing his alcohol consumption and frequency and by August 2019, he was \nconsuming alcohol daily. He continued to hide his drinking from his wife and lie to her. He \ndid not think there was any specific stressor going on in his life at the time that prompted \nhim to drink. (Tr. 27-31, 76-77, 88-95, 100-101; GE 3, 4, 7; AE K) \nApplicant told the investigator that in August 2019, he decided the four-day \ndetoxification program he participated in October 2018, did not work. Applicant voluntarily \nenrolled in a 21-day inpatient alcohol treatment program. He told the investigator that he \nsuccessfully completed the program and a follow-on outpatient program, which involved \n12 sessions, each lasting three to four hours. He also participated in continuing care once \na week and AA meetings twice a week. He said he had not consumed alcohol since \nAugust 2019. He said he felt like he was back where he needed to be and it was not a \nstruggle or an issue to remain sober. He had not participated in any additional alcohol-\nrelated counseling or treatment at that time. (Tr. 32-33, 87; GE 7) \nApplicant testified that after August 2019 he had an AA sponsor and stayed sober \nuntil November 2020, when he was preparing a meal and one of the ingredients was red \nwine. He took a gulp of the wine. He said within seven days he had progressed to daily \ndrinking. He estimated he was drinking between a pint and a fifth of bourbon daily. He \nwas in a state of depression and despair. He had been participating in AA but started to \nslack off. He entered alcohol treatment and was in a 21-day inpatient treatment program. \nHe did not contact his AA sponsor when he started to drink again but waited until he was \nadmitted into the inpatient program.

He testified \nabout what has changed. He said he is now plugged in with AA and is consistent with his \nattendance. His 2020 treatment was organized differently, and he is now with a group of \nmen around his age. He felt there was a deeper sense of the spiritual side of recovery, \nwhere he is more focused. He is following the 12-step AA program and is being \nresponsible as a trusted servant. He is now more active in the program and serves in \ndifferent positions, including being a chairman for monthly business meetings. He said he \nis also a sponsor for three others who reach out to him. He attends 3 to 5 meetings per \nweek and in the past attended 7 to 12 meetings a week. He provided attendance sheets \nfrom his AA meetings to corroborate his meeting attendance from December 2020 to \nJanuary 2023. (Tr. 39-44, 99, 105; AE J) \nApplicant acknowledged that he cannot give 100% assurance that he will not drink \nin the future. He acknowledged he has a disease and that if he consumes one drink it will \nset off a cycle of destructive behavior. He is not sure if he consumes alcohol again if he \nwill be able to recover and that scares him. He has a responsibility to his family and his \nemployer, which he takes seriously. He said he has the support of his family, friends, and \ncoworkers who know he is working on his sobriety. (Tr. 42-46, 56, 107-108) \nApplicant testified that in 2005 he was prescribed Norco, a painkiller, by his family \ndoctor, due to a sciatic problem with his back. The prescription is to take one tablet twice \na day as needed for pain. In the last five years, he estimated he takes it about two to three \ntimes a week on average and only if Ibuprofen does not work. He will usually take half a \ntablet, but if the pain is severe, he will take the full tablet twice a day, as prescribed. He \ncredibly testified that he does not use it for any other purposes. He knows that as an \nalcoholic it could be dangerous with his brain chemistry. He said that he has never felt a \ncompulsion to attempt to increase its effect. He stated that alcohol is one thing and opiates \nare another. He disputed that when he was admitted for alcohol treatment in 2019 that he \nsaid he took more Norco than was prescribed. He stated what he told the medical staff \nwas that he took more than he usually takes, but not more than was prescribed. He is \naware drugs and alcohol do not mix and he does not use them beyond what is prescribed. \nApplicant has not discussed his alcoholism with his family doctor. Applicant\u2019s doctor who \nprescribes the medication provided a written statement regarding Applicant\u2019s use. He \nconfirmed Applicant has used it for many years, and he does not have any concern that \nhe is abusing it. I found Applicant\u2019s statement credible that he did not exceed the \nprescribed dosage. (Tr. 51-55, 59-74; AE D) \nApplicant participated in a psychological evaluation by a government-employed \npsychologist, Dr. F, in August 2021. The interview lasted approximately eight hours and \nwas conducted in person. Dr. F provided a detailed narrative that for the most part \ncoincides with the facts of Applicant\u2019s past alcohol abuse. Dr. F diagnosed Applicant with \nmajor depressive disorder, recurrent, exacerbated by grief/loss in sustained remission; \nand alcohol use disorder, severe in sustained remission. He believed Applicant is more \ncommitted to working his AA program this time around and to saving his family and career. \nHe believes he has a much better support groups in AA, his worksite coworkers plus \nmanagement, and his family and friends.

His prognosis is good, and Dr. F did not find Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse would \nhave a negative impact on his reliability, stability, judgment, or trustworthiness. (Tr. 47-\n50; GE 3) \nApplicant participated in a one-hour Zoom evaluation by a government-employed \npsychologist, Dr. B, in February 2022. Applicant said he told Dr. B that he had been \nevaluated in August 2021, and she told him that this evaluation must be a follow-up check-\nin conversation. Dr. B described Applicant as evasive. He answered her questions and \nwas not sure how much detail she wanted because he was told it was a wellness check. \nDr. B indicated she gave Applicant the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) test and \nthe validity scales indicated he was consistent in his responding, and did not attempt to \nover or under report symptoms or behaviors that individuals commnly admit to. However, \nshe found that certain aspects of the profile raise the possibility of denial problems with \ndrinking and drug abuse. Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, severe; \nmajor depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified severity; generalized anxiety disorder; \nopioid disorder; tobacco use disorder; pornography addiction R/O, which means rule out. \nShe did not find Applicant truthful during the interview She derived her diagnostic \nimpressions primarily from her clinical judgment and medical record review. She found \nApplicant may be unreliable or untrustworthy, impulsive, engage in dangerous activities, \nor take unnecessary risks and his prognosis is poor. (Tr. 47-50; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified. She has tried to support her husband. She believes he \nhas been sober for more than two years and is actively participating in AA. His drinking \nhas been stressful on their marriage. In the past, she was confident that he would maintain \nhis sobriety, but believes this time he is dedicated and committed to it. She has never \nobserved him abuse Norco and does not believe he abuses it. She believes he has a \ndisease that only he can control. He is a good man and wants to do the right thing. She \nhas known he is an alcoholic since about 2006. Most of the time he would not divulge to \nher he was drinking. He would not tell her the truth about his drinking. She would bring \nhis drinking to his attention and remove the alcohol from the house, but she could not \nstop him. (Tr. 110-122) \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor testified on his behalf. He has been his sponsor for about \nthree or four years. He said Applicant is doing great and attends a lot of meetings. They \nget together about once or twice a month and see each other at meetings. He believes \nApplicant\u2019s sobriety is solid and he is a man of integrity. Applicant has followed his AA \nplan, but has stumbled when he relapsed in 2020. Since then, he has been in compliance. \nApplicant has sought assistance from his sponsor. (Tr. 123-130) \nA character witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has held a security \nclearance for 25 years. He was Applicant\u2019s supervisor who fired him in 2009 when he was \ndrinking on a work trip in a foreign country. He was offered an opportunity to rehire \nApplicant for a specific contract and chose not to because he wanted to see how he was \nperforming elsewhere. A couple of years later, he noted a change in Applicant and \nbelieved he was in a good spot and was low risk. He rehired him in July 2019.

Applicant is doing well at his job, and he does not \nhave a concern about him having access to classified information. (Tr. 24, 131-141) \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer testified on his behalf. They have worked \ntogether since 1998. She is aware of the concerns about his issues with alcohol. He has \nbeen upfront with her and self-reported his issues. When he went back into treatment in \nNovember 2020, he talked to her about it. She believes he is a person of integrity. He is \nprofessional and meticulous in his work. She does not have concerns about his \nalcoholism. (143-148) \nCharacter letters were provided from Applicant\u2019s sister and longtime friend. He is \ndescribed as intelligent, reliable, dependable, and beloved. They believe that Applicant is \ntotally committed to his sobriety this time because he is immersed in AA and more active \nand determined. (AE H, I) \nApplicant provided his employee performance evaluations for 2020, 2021, and \n2022. He is consistently evaluated in the different performance categories as excellent \nand outstanding. (AE A, B, C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \nApplicant received treatment for alcohol abuse and was diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence after he received inpatient treatment at an alcohol rehabilitation facility \nseveral times from June 2007 to September 2009. Excessive alcohol consumption \nimpaired his judgment. He failed to show up for work due to his alcohol abuse and was \nterminated. While on a business trip to a foreign country he consumed alcohol and failed \nto do his job. \nIn October 2018, Applicant was hospitalized as an inpatient for alcohol abuse. He \nwas diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. In about August 2019, he was \nhospitalized for 21 days as an inpatient for alcohol abuse treatment and another 12 days \nfor IOP. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. In November 2020, he was \nhospitalized for about 21 days for alcohol abuse. Government psychologists evaluated \nhim in 2021 and 2022. Both diagnosed him with alcohol abuse disorder, severe. Dr. B \nopined that his mental health issues could make him unreliable, untrustworthy, impulsive \nand that he may engage in dangerous activities and take unnecessary risks. His \nprognosis was poor. The other Government psychologist found his prognosis was good \nand did not have the same concerns. There is sufficient evidence to apply all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith nay required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant continues to struggle with his alcoholism. He relapsed after treatment \nnumerous times. He repeatedly commits to his sobriety and abstaining from alcohol \nconsumption only to become lax and fall back into his same pattern of drinking. Although \nhis wife supports his sobriety, he hides his drinking and lies to her about it. He has an AA \nsponsor with whom he has been with for several years, but he has had a sponsor in the \npast and still continued to relapse. Het is an active participant in the AA program, which \nagain he has been in the past. During his 2012 hearing, he said he attended meetings \nand took on leadership roles in AA, which he testified that he is doing again since \nrecommitting to the program. During his first hearing, he explained that he was now fully \ncommitted to his sobriety. I found him credible in 2012, and I believe each time he fails, \nhe recommits himself. I found Applicant credible in his earnest attempt to remain sober. \nAt his first hearing, he had been sober 19 months. He was given a second chance and \ngranted eligibility to access classified information. \nIn 2016, Applicant resumed drinking and in October 2018, he participated in a \ndetoxification program. Shortly after completion, he resumed drinking in December 2018. \nHe participated in a 21-day inpatient treatment program in August 2019, followed with a \n12-day IOP and resumed drinking in November 2020. He is participating in AA and says \nhe has been sober since November 2020. He believes that this time he will be able to \nremain sober. Although alcoholism is a disease and his body reacts to it in a negative \nway, it does not impede Applicant\u2019s ability to make a choice about whether to drink or not. \nHe repeatedly makes the wrong choice. Based on the frequency of Applicant\u2019s past \nalcohol abuse and conduct, not enough time has passed to conclude future problems will \nnot recur. AG \u00b6 23 (a) does not apply. \nApplicant has acknowledged his alcohol use and his actions to overcome the \nproblem. I have no evidence that Applicant is participating in any program except AA, \nwhich is an acceptable program. It appears he is following the program, but again without \na significant long period of sobriety, I cannot find that any of the remaining mitigating \nconditions fully apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder. \nI have considered all of the evidence and conclude that there is insufficient \nevidence that Applicant misused the painkiller he was prescribed. I found Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible that he usually took less than prescribed and when he explained he \ntook more, he meant it was more than he usually took, not more than prescribed. I have \nconsidered the statement from his prescribing physician that Applicant has been in \ncompliance and that of his wife who has not observed him abuse the drug. I have also \nconsidered Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis and did not find it as probative as the totality of the \nevidence. The above disqualifying conditions do not apply, and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor \nunder this guideline.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and H in my whole-person analysis. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. I find in his favor for Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR.

In an \u201cabundance of caution,\u201d Applicant listed six cousins on his \nsecurity clearance application (e-QIP), who are all citizens of Pakistan, but two reside \noutside of Pakistan, one in the United Arab Emirates, and the other in Qatar. Applicant \nhas little or no contact with his cousins. (TR at page 25 line 9 to page 35 line 20, and \nAnswer at pages 7~8.) \nNotice \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Pakistan: Pakistan is \nan Islamic Republic. The Department of State has assessed parts of the country to be \nMEDIUM or HIGH-threat locations. During 2021, there was a lack of government \naccountability, and abuses, including corruption, that often went unpunished, fostering a \nculture of impunity among perpetrators, whether official or unofficial. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, five siblings and numerous cousins are citizens of Pakistan. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s mother has a green card, and his father has a standing visa to visit \nthe United States. She is a housewife, and he is 75-year-old retiree. Applicant has little \ncontact with his siblings, and little or none with his cousins. Foreign Influence is found \nfor Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace and in his community. (AppX B.) Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Foreign Influence security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

An SOR was included that reported numerous delinquent debts supported by credit reports. The SOR noted that Applicant was aware of most of the delinquent accounts and was unable to pay them. The DON CAF issued a Final Denial of Eligibility for Security Clearance letter in June 2012. (GE 6) Applicant testified that he resolved his outstanding debts while serving in the military. He said he has held a secret security clearance since approximately 2012. He completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2021. In it, he disclosed he was discharged from the military in August 2016 and started a part-time job the same month and worked until June 2017. He then left this employment to accept a f",

There were no objections, and they were \nadmitted in evidence. The record remained opened until July 18, 2023, to permit Applicant \nan opportunity to provide additional evidence. He submitted AE P through AE Y. He \nincorrectly submitted a second exhibit marked AE P. A review of the exhibits shows that \nthe original AE P is included in AE Q. The second AE P is a new exhibit. I have attached \nboth to the record and will refer to AE Q for substantive evidence. There were no \nobjections to the exhibits. They were admitted in evidence and the record closed. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on July 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, and 1.e. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.d. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married in 2012 and divorced in 2021. He has a child \nfrom the marriage and shares joint custody with his ex-wife. He served in the military from \n2011 to 2016 and was honorably discharged. He has taken college courses but does not \nhave a degree. He has worked for a federal contractor since May 2020. (Tr. 21-26, 28, \n80; GE 1) \nIn December 2011, Applicant received a letter of intent to deny eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance from the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON \nCAF). An SOR was included that reported numerous delinquent debts supported by credit \nreports. The SOR noted that Applicant was aware of most of the delinquent accounts and \nwas unable to pay them. The DON CAF issued a Final Denial of Eligibility for Security \nClearance letter in June 2012. (GE 6) \nApplicant testified that he resolved his outstanding debts while serving in the \nmilitary. He said he has held a secret security clearance since approximately 2012. He \ncompleted a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2021. In it, he disclosed he was \ndischarged from the military in August 2016 and started a part-time job the same month \nand worked until June 2017. He then left this employment to accept a full-time position. \nHe disclosed he worked full time until February 2018 and left this position because his \nmother was sick. He worked full time from February 2018 to April 2019 and disclosed he \nleft this position because he was \u201cabout to move after mother died.\u201d He worked part time \nfrom April 2019 to May 2020 before being hired by his present employer. He did not \ndisclose any periods of unemployment on his SCA. (Tr. 11, 25, 29, 46; GE 1) \nApplicant also disclosed in his SCA that as part of a background check to obtain a \nsecurity clearance in 2012 while serving in the Navy, he was investigated by the DOD. \nHe stated \u201cI was in sub school.

He \ntestified he died on the day Applicant started his job. He stayed in the job for about four \nmonths until April 2017. His mother was hospitalized in 2017. In May 2017, he moved \nback home to take care of her. She passed away in March 2018. Applicant testified that \nwhen he moved home, he did not have a job. He said he chose to be unemployed for \nnine months from May 2017 to March 2018. These dates are inconsistent with the \ninformation he provided on his SCA. (Tr. 30-36; GE 1) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his period of unemployment while \ncaring for his mother. At the time, he was receiving $400 to $500 a month from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) for disability. He said when his father died, his mother \nreceived survivor\u2019s benefits and Social Security payments. His father did not have life \ninsurance and they had no savings. He also attributed his financial problems to his \ndivorce, but acknowledged he was responsible for the debts alleged. (Tr. 36-40) \nApplicant testified that after his mother passed away, he started working in April \n2018 as an apprentice aircraft mechanic at a military base. He left federal employment \nwhen he was hired in March 2020 by his present employer where he earns more. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony of his employment dates is inconsistent with his SCA. (Tr. 40-44; \nGE 1) \nAs part of his background investigation, Applicant was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in October 2021. He told the investigator that his financial \nstruggles began when his father passed away in January 2017, and he felt responsible \nto care for his mother and help her continue the lifestyle she had been accustomed to. \nHis financial struggles worsened when his mother passed away in early 2018. He \ninherited his parents\u2019 house, where he was living, and assumed the financial responsibility \nfor the mortgage payments. In his answer to the SOR, he said since his parents passed \naway \u201cI\u2019ve just been trying to maintain what\u2019s back home. I gave my whole life up to come \nback home to try [and] buy [the] house and keep the land looking good just like they \nwanted.\u201d He testified that after his parents passed away, his goal was to buy their house. \nHe continued to make the mortgage payments. He testified that his goal is to purchase \nhis parents\u2019 house and maintain his credit and to do that he must take care of his debt. \n(Tr. 51-54, 79; GE 2; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant disclosed to the investigator that he had a credit-card account that he \nused for daily necessities. He recalled to the investigator that the balance at some point \nwas over $10,000. He said he would contact the creditor to make payment arrangements. \nWhen asked if he had more than one account with the creditor, he could not recall. He \nwas confronted with a second credit-card account, and he confirmed it belonged to him. \nHe said he used both credit cards to pay daily expenses, bills, and necessities.

The two credit card-accounts are \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($18,660) and 1.b ($17,899). \nApplicant testified that he began accumulating credit card debts in about 2017. He \nsaid his wife was using the cards, but he also was using them. The credit cards are in his \nname only. Applicant testified that he made payment arrangements for the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with the creditor. He provided a letter from the creditor dated May \n31, 2023, stating it confirmed a payment arrangement to begin in June 2023 to pay $25 \na month and it referenced the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided undated documents to \nshow he made payments presumably on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b (based on the balance \nowed) in the amounts as follows: $165, $150, $15, $120, $30, $90, and $75. He testified \nthat he had a previous payment agreement from May 2022 and made payments, but he \ndid not keep track of them. He did not provide a copy of this agreement. He said he was \nmaking payments \u201con and off.\u201d He testified that he had been making consistent payments \nonce he received the SOR. He said his agreement was to make two monthly payments \non each account for a total of four $25 payments a month. He provided a document dated \nJune 10, 2023, from the creditor referencing the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a and its receipt of \n$25 with a remaining balance of $18,430. It did not reference a payment agreement for \nthis debt, only a payment. Post-hearing, he provided a document to show the current \nbalance on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b had decreased and was now $17,614. (Tr. 46-52, 8185-\n87, 89-95; AE B, C, S, T, V, W) \nApplicant was confronted with the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,457). He \nexplained to the investigator that this charge was used to purchase furniture and the \noriginal balance was about $4,000. The account became delinquent in 2017 when he was \ntraveling to visit his father in the hospital and sometimes, he was only working three days \na week. He told the investigator he intended to satisfy the balance. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that four years ago he contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c and contacted them again a year before receiving the SOR and made them an offer \nto settle the debt. After receiving the SOR, he contacted the collection creditor but was \nadvised that the statute of limitations had run on the collection of the debt. He said he \ncontacted the collection company and offered to make payment arrangements or settle \nthe debt. He provided a copy of a letter he sent to the creditor. He provided copies of \nthree checks each for $15 paid to the creditor in June and July 2022.1  (Tr. 60-67; AE G, \nJ) \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with the collection account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($233). He told the investigator this was a utility bill for his residence that he \noverlooked paying when he moved home to be with his mother in 2018. He intended to \n1 In Applicant\u2019s exhibit list he labeled AE G as payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. AE G includes three \nchecks drafted from his credit union that is also the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The checks are made out to the \ncollection creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c not the creditor in \u00b6 1.a.

In his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided proof that the collection account was \npaid in January 2022. (Tr. 67-68; GE 2; Answer to the SOR; AE H) \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with the charged-off account in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e ($2,249). He told the investigator that he had purchased a wedding ring for his wife. \nHe said the original balance for the account was $5,000. He had been paying on the \naccount but when his parents passed his priorities shifted. He intended to satisfy the \naccount. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he has a payment agreement with the creditor for the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e to pay $50 a month on the collection account. The letter he provided states: \n\u201cThis letter is to confirm your offer to make a voluntary payment arrangement and your \nauthorization on 05/06/2022 of recurring transfers from your bank account.\u201d (emphasis \nadded) He provided documents that show on May 10, 2022, and May 23, 2022, his \nautomatic transfers were $23.43 and on June 22, 2022, his transfer was for $23.19. It \nappears these transfers were automatic. He did not provide documents to show he \ncontinued these automatic transfers. He testified he stopped the payments because he \nwas paying other bills. He then provided documents from the creditor beginning in \nJanuary 2023 that do not reference an automatic transfer but reference a voluntary \npayment of $25 that was to be electronically debited. He provided proof he made two \npayments of $25 in January 2023, and then one monthly payment of $25 through April \n2023, and two payments of $25 in May and two $25 payments in June 2023. (Tr. 69-76, \n97; AE D, E, F, Q, R) \nApplicant told the investigator that he was able to make payments on his accounts \nand satisfy his debts. He intended to contact the creditors and make payment \narrangements. At that time, he was not on a payment plan with any of his creditors. He \ntold the investigator that his financial stability improved when his VA disability was \napproved for 100% in March 2021, and he was working full time for his present employer. \n(GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he earns approximately $46,000 annually from his \nemployment. His said his VA disability rating was increased in April 2022 to 100% and he \nnow receives $3,971 a month ($47,652 annually). He also testified his VA disability began \nin January 2022. His testimony as to the date his VA disability increased differs from what \nhe told the investigator, that is March 2021. He provided a document from the VA, but it \ndoes not show the date he began receiving the increased payment. (Tr. 44-46, 87-89; AE \nP) \nApplicant testified he does not have a budget. Post-hearing, Applicant provided a \npersonal financial statement from July 2023. He reports he has $1,300 in expendable \nincome after he pays his bills. He lists two credit cards that are current with a total balance \nof approximately $18,000 that he makes monthly payments of $250 on each. He also lists \nhis mortgage of $1,220 a month.

In 2022, he gave the truck to his teenage son. He \nestimated his monthly expenses for the truck are $180 for the loan, $400 for insurance, \nand $280 for gas. He explained \u201cI got him the truck because I couldn\u2019t get him a new truck \nlike his friends got. So I was able to give him something, though, and things like that just \nso he can be happy.\u201d He pays $540 for child support but anticipates this amount may \nincrease due to the new amount for his disability payments. He also expects his child to \ngo to college. He believes his military benefits will cover many of the expenses, but there \nwill likely be additional ones not covered. (Tr. 54-60, 82-85, 100-103) \nApplicant was asked if he had filed his federal income tax returns on time and paid \nif he owed taxes. He stated he had not filed on time in the past five years but did file late, \nand he was sure he owed taxes. He stated his tax balance had increased. He made two \npayments of $25 to the IRS, and he did not have a payment plan. He said he plans to pay \nhis tax debt and now that he has 100% VA disability he will be able to pay. Post-hearing, \nApplicant provided a document presumably from the IRS website that shows Applicant\u2019s \n2022 tax year balance is $582; 2021 tax year balance is $1,820; and 2020 tax year \nbalance is $806. (Tr.109-115) \nApplicant provided a document to show he took an online quiz from a credit \norganization that tested his current understanding of credit reports. It stated that when he \ncompleted the end of the course, he should take the post-quiz and receive his Document \nof Achievement. It is unclear whether the scores presented in the document are pre-quiz \nor post-quiz. There were ten questions and Applicant answered eight correctly and the \ntime taken to complete it was two minutes and eight seconds. A Document of \nAchievement was not provided. (AE I) \nApplicant provided character letters that describe him as responsible, assertive, \nindependent, hard-working, kind, loyal, mature, reliable, valuable, professional, honest, \nintelligent, disciplined, productive, and a team player.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to a period of unemployment when he was \ntraveling in 2016 to see his father before he passed away in January 2017, and when he \nwas caring for his mother before she passed away in March 2018. He also attributed it to \nhis divorce. These were conditions that were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must show he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant stopped paying legitimate bills, lived off of his credit cards, and \nmade the choice not to work for nine months. Although it is understandable that he felt a \ncompelling need to be with his mother, he failed to act responsibly regarding his debts \nafter she passed away. He was made aware that his debts were a security concern when \nhe completed his SCA in May 2021 and when he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator in October 2021. He indicated to the investigator that his VA disability rating \nwas increased to 100%, and he was in a better financial situation. At that time, he \nindicated his intent to contact creditors and make payment arrangements. He did not \nbegin to address most of his debts until after he received the SOR. He made a payment \nagreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e to make recurring automatic payments. He did \nthis for a couple of months then stopped. He resumed six months later. He said he had a \npayment agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to resolve both debts. The \ndocuments reflect that only the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is part of the plan that began in May \n2023 to pay $25 a month. I have considered he made sporadic payments. One of his \ndebts is now barred by the statute of limitation. It has been five years since his parents \npassed away. There is insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant acted responsibly. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) only partially applies. \nApplicant\u2019s debts may have originally occurred under unique circumstances, but \nhis failure to address them and take meaningful action raises a concern. Based on his \nfinancial history, I cannot find they are unlikely to recur. His failure to address his debts \nor contact the creditors when he said he would casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant may have participated in some type of credit counseling, there \nis insufficient evidence to conclude his financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \nhas minimal application. \nApplicant provided proof he has made some small payments to his creditors. He \nprovided proof that he resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d but it was four years overdue. One \ndebt is now barred by the statute of limitations. Based on the minimal amount of his \npayments on large debts despite having expendable income, the short period of time he \nhas made payments, his delay in addressing the debts, and his inconsistent payment \nhistory, AG \u00b6 20(d) has minimal application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and disability. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s devotion to his parents during their last stages of life. However, Applicant has \nan overall poor financial track record, including his failure to timely pay his federal income \ntaxes. Based on his minimal efforts since 2018, I am not confident he is committed to \nresolving his legitimate debts. I find Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

It was \na one-time experimental use. He did not use marijuana again until he was deployed to \nIraq in 2009. He was deployed to Iraq from approximately July 2008 to October 2009. \nAlthough Applicant admitted the use of alcohol and marijuana was prohibited in Iraq by a \nGeneral Order, several of his fellow soldiers were drinking alcohol to blow off steam. He \nwas a driver and decided it was better to use marijuana instead of alcohol even though \nhe was aware marijuana use was prohibited.

(AE A at 5 \u2013 7) Applicant also received a certificate of appreciation for his \nsupport of the Army\u2019s mission. (AE A at 8)  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nan October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws prohibiting \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state can authorize \nviolations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state law (and \nthe laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the national \nsecurity adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law concerning \nthe use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making eligibility \ndecisions for sensitive national security positions.  \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b)  testing positive for an illegal drug; and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession \nof drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant has a lengthy history of illegal marijuana use. He used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from October 2009 to January 2010 and from July 2014 to November \n2022. He was discharged from the U.S. Army because of a positive urinalysis test. \nBetween February 2015 to May 2018, he was arrested three times in the U.S. The \ncharged offenses for each arrest included the charge of possession of marijuana. AG \u00b6 \n25(a); AG \u00b6 25(b); and AG \u00b6 25(c) apply. \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long history of marijuana use continues to be a security concern. He \nused marijuana ranging from a weekly to a monthly basis. He used marijuana although \nhe was aware that it was against DoD policy and unlawful. He decided to stop using \nmarijuana in February 2021 because he was applying for a security clearance, yet he \nused again in November 2022 while his security clearance adjudication was pending. His \ndecision to use marijuana, an illegal drug, on a regular basis over a long period of time \ncannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather a pattern of behavior that \nreflects his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations. Security clearance decisions are \nnot limited to conduct during duty hours. Off-duty conduct, especially where it reflects \npoor judgment, provides a rational basis for the government to question an appellant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. \nDepartment of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed \na disregard for the law, regulations, and the fiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered \ninto with the Government. \nApplicant\u2019s assertions that he has stopped using illegal drugs since November \n2022 are insufficient to overcome the concerns with respect to his past drug involvement. \nAt this time, he did not demonstrate a lengthy enough pattern of abstinence, given the \ncircumstances under which he chose to use illegal drugs. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and \nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant illegally used marijuana from October 2009 to January 2010, and July \n2014 to November 2022. He was arrested on three occasions and charged with \nmarijuana\u2013related offenses in 2015 and 2018. These occurred while he was employed \nas a DoD contractor overseas.

Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure \nto appear in court related to his marijuana-related offenses, resulted in warrants being \nissued for his arrest. The warrants for his arrest remain outstanding. His criminal issues \nare not resolved because of his decision to flee to his job overseas rather than dealing \nwith the criminal offenses in the U.S. While Applicant\u2019s co-workers think highly of him, \nthere is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation because of the outstanding \nwarrants, and Applicant\u2019s decision to continue to illegally use marijuana up until \nNovember 2022. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f. These allegations were \nappropriately considered under the drug involvement and criminal conduct concerns. For \nthis reason, I find SOR \u00b6 3.a for Applicant. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his answers on his June 30, 2021, \nSCA about his criminal arrests in response to Section 22 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b \u2013 3.c) and his \nillegal marijuana use within the past 7 years in response to Section 23. (SOR \u00b6 3.d) I find \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. Applicant deliberately omitted his three arrests and his illegal \nmarijuana use. During his background investigation interview on April 13, 2022, he told \nthe investigator that he did not list any of his arrests because he thought they would reflect \nnegatively on him. Applicant claims the e-QIP program would not let him input the relevant \ninformation. I don\u2019t find this information credible. \nIn response to Section 22, Applicant was required to disclose his illegal use of \nmarijuana within the last seven years. In other words, his illegal marijuana use from June \n30, 2014, to June 30, 2021, the date he completed his security clearance application. He \ndid not do so, even though he later admitted he used marijuana on a weekly or a monthly \nbasis between 2014 to February 2021. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. While Applicant disclosed his arrests and illegal \nmarijuana use during his background investigation interview in August 2021, he did not \nprovide the information until the background investigator asked him about the issues. The \ndisclosures were not prompt. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nfalsifications were not minor and continue to raise doubts about his reliability, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(e) applies. Applicant\u2019s eventual disclosures \nabout his arrests and illegal drug use reduced his vulnerability to be exploited, \nmanipulated or under duress. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his arrests and his illegal drug use within \nthe past seven years raises issues about his honesty and trustworthiness. The security \nconcerns raised under personal conduct are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, J and E in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nI also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, including the \nstatements from his friends and co-workers, and his work history as DoD contractor. The \nunfavorable evidence raises concerns that outweigh the favorable evidence. Applicant \nhas a long history of illegal marijuana use. His illegal marijuana use resulted in his \ndischarge from the U.S. Army. While he stopped using marijuana for several years after \nhis discharge, he resumed using marijuana in 2014 on a regular basis. He only stopped \nusing marijuana in February 2021 because he was applying for a security clearance. He \ncontinued to use marijuana in November 2022. The issues involving his marijuana-related \narrests in 2015 and 2018 are unresolved because of his deliberate failure to appear. His \ncriminal warrants remain outstanding. He was less than forthcoming about these issues \non his June 2021 security clearance application. \nApplicant did not mitigate security concerns raised under drug involvement, \ncriminal conduct, and personal conduct. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b -3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

(Tr. 35-36) When he first sought help, he was drinking four or \nfive days a week and about \u201ca few glasses of wine [and] a half a pint of vodka.\u201d (Tr. 36) \nApplicant said on January 4, 2012, Dr. L advised him to decrease his alcohol \nconsumption. (Tr. 37) She said he was supposed to \u201cslow down at the very least\u201d on his \nalcohol consumption. (Tr. 37) Dr. L did not tell him to abstain completely from alcohol \nconsumption. SOR \u00b6 2.d alleges and Applicant admits that on August 28, 2012, he told \nDr. L that he continued to consume alcohol, and Dr. L recommended he receive \nsubstance abuse counseling. In August 2012, he was consuming a pint of alcohol four \ntimes a week. (Tr. 38; GE 3 at 116) At his hearing, he said he did not remember that Dr. \nL recommended that he obtain substance abuse counseling. (Tr. 37, 40) He was sober \nfor a while, and then he resumed his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 38) Sometimes he hid his \nalcohol consumption from his spouse. (Tr. 39-40; GE 3 at 116) He did not remember \nspecific information about his level of alcohol consumption or his behavior with his \nspouse. (Tr. 40) Dr. L. prescribed Campral for him; however, he did not continue taking it \nbecause he was worried it would make him sick if he drank alcohol. (Tr. 41) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges and Applicant admits that he received inpatient treatment from \nOctober 14 to October 16, 2013, for renal colic and alcohol abuse.

For SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant said Dr. L recommended that \nhe reduce his alcohol consumption and not that he cease all alcohol consumption. For \nSOR \u00b6 2.j he did not remember being advised to stop drinking alcohol. \nFrom 1999 to about 2006, Applicant drank alcohol to help him cope with anxiety. \n(Tr. 34) He received medication which helped with his anxiety.

The SCA asked him in the previous seven years: whether \nhe had consulted with a health-care professional regarding an emotional or mental-health \ncondition; and whether alcohol had a negative impact on his professional and personal \nrelationships. His SCA also asked whether he had: ever been ordered, advised, or asked \nto seek counseling or treatment because of his use of alcohol; and ever sought counseling \nand treatment because of his use of alcohol. Applicant answered, no, to these four \nquestions. \nApplicant understood the questions on his SCA. (Tr. 59) He did not disclose his \nhistory of mental health and alcohol treatment on his SCA because he did not think it was \nan issue for him or in the alternative, he said he did not remember why he did not disclose \nthe requested information. (Tr. 55) His alcohol consumption did not affect his work and \ndid not involve law enforcement. (Tr. 55) He admitted his alcohol consumption had a \nnegative impact on his marriage. (Tr. 56) He did not remember the wording in the SCA\u2019s \nquestion about being advised to seek alcohol treatment, and he may have considered the \nquestion to be asking whether he was ordered to seek alcohol treatment as opposed to \na suggestion. (Tr. 56) He answered, no, to the question about mental-health treatment \nbecause he believed his mental health \u201cwas under control.\u201d (Tr. 57) He was unsure about \nhis state of mind at the time he answered the questions on his SCA.

(Tr. 22-23)    \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;   \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f). \nAdditional discussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption contributed to his decision to take about \n10 Xanax in February 2015. He has a history of repeatedly consuming alcohol to \nintoxication. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. He failed to follow treatment \nrecommendations from Dr. L in 2012, from an alcohol treatment facility in 2013, from Dr. \nF in 2016, and from Dr. K in 2017, to reduce or abstain from consumption of alcohol. After \nsome reductions of his alcohol consumption, he resumed his alcohol consumption at \nsignificant levels.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He reduced his alcohol consumption in 2021 to 2022 to \na low level, and he stopped consuming alcohol about one year ago. He has never been \narrested or convicted of any alcohol-related offense. There is no evidence of security \nviolations, use of alcohol or impairment at work, or abuse of illegal drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and the possibility of renewed alcohol \nconsumption to the extent of intoxication and poor decisions casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. More time without alcohol consumption in \naccordance with treatment recommendations is necessary to reduce security concerns. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply, and Guideline G security concerns are not \nmitigated at this time. \nPsychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, \nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, \nchronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c) are established. See also USAF-M Case No. 23-\n00056-R at 5-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2023) (discussing interrelationship between alcohol-\nrelated security events and application of AG \u00b6 28(a)). AG \u00b6 28(d) is not alleged in the \nSOR, and AG \u00b6 28(d) will not be considered as a disqualifying condition. Additional \ndiscussion of the disqualifying conditions will be included in the mitigation section, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant was hospitalized after consuming about a pint of vodka and overdosing \non Xanax in February 2017. On February 1, 2022, a psychologist, Dr. G, diagnosed \nApplicant with Alcohol Use Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, and Depressive \nDisorder, unspecified. He said Applicant was defensive about his alcohol consumption, \nand he concluded Applicant exhibits issues with reliability and trustworthiness which may \nimpair his ability to protect classified information. His evaluation observed that a March \n2017 treatment note states, \u201cHis history of drinking included one pint of vodka daily or \nmore for nine years. He had a history of blackouts. His longest period of sobriety was \nseven days in 2016 due to pain in the abdomen.\u201d (GE 2 at 4) Dr. G said his mental health \nconditions pose a significant risk to his judgment and stability in the future unless he \nobtains treatment and maintains sobriety. \nApplicant did not provide a recommendation from a treatment provider, \npsychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other health-care practitioner that his \nidentified condition: (1) is readily controllable with treatment; (2) is amenable to treatment; \n(3) was temporary and the situation has been resolved; (4) is under control or in \nremission; (5) is not a current problem; or (6) has a favorable prognosis. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) \nthrough 29(e). He is not currently receiving alcohol or mental-health treatment or \ncounseling beyond renewal of prescriptions. There is no schedule of planned \nassessments to determine his current mental-health status. He receives support from \nfamily; however, family and his former spouse\u2019s support are not listed in the mitigating \nconditions for psychological conditions.  \nBecause of the interrelationship between his history of alcohol consumption and \nhis mental health issues, I cannot rule out a recurrence of an episode of poor judgment. \nAs discussed in the previous section, his alcohol consumption raises serious security \nconcerns. Not enough time without alcohol consumption or with responsible alcohol \nconsumption in accordance with treatment recommendations has elapsed. I have \nlingering concerns that Applicant will again be under stress or suffering from anxiety, will \nagain resume alcohol consumption, and then he may make poor security-related \ndecisions. Psychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies and will be addressed in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused\nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with\nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone,\ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the\nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E\nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present\nevidence to explain the omission.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nApplicant admitted that he failed to disclose requested information on his \nDecember 14, 2016 SCA. This SCA asked him in the previous seven years: whether he \nhad consulted with a health-care professional regarding an emotional or mental-health \ncondition; and whether alcohol had a negative impact on his professional and personal \nrelationships. This SCA also asked: whether he had ever been ordered, advised, or asked \nto seek counseling or treatment because of his use of alcohol; and whether he had ever \nsought counseling and treatment because of his use of alcohol. Applicant answered, no, \nto these four questions. \nApplicant said he understood the questions on his December 14, 2016 SCA. He \nwas unsure about his rationale for not disclosing the information; however, he suggested \nthat at the time he completed his SCA he did not consider the information to be a \u201cbig \ndeal.\u201d He failed to honestly and candidly disclose negative information on his SCA. When \nhe answered no, he knowingly and intentionally provided false information with intent to \ndeceive. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines G, I, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old information technology specialist. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer for about one year. In 2003, he received an associate degree in \ncomputer networking. He was married from 2008 to 2017. His former spouse and \nsupervisor positively described his character, and their statements support approval of \nhis access to classified information. There is no evidence of criminal offenses, drug \nabuse, violations of his employer\u2019s rules, or security violations. \nThe evidence against granting Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is more \npersuasive. Applicant has a history of binge-alcohol consumption. In 2017, Applicant \nconsumed an excessive amount of alcohol and overdosed on Xanax. On February 1, \n2022, Dr. G diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol Use Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, \nunspecified, and Depressive Disorder, unspecified. He said Applicant was defensive \nabout his alcohol consumption, and he concluded Applicant exhibits issues with reliability \nand trustworthiness which may impair his ability to protect classified information. More \nimportantly Applicant was not candid and truthful when he completed his December 14, \n2016 SCA. He did not disclose his history of recommendations, treatment, and counseling \nfor mental-health and alcohol-consumption issues. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Guidelines G, I, and E security concerns are not mitigated \nat this time. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

Paragraph 1 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she has a psychological condition that raises security concerns. Specifically, the SOR alleged that Applicant has experienced multiple hospitalizations for psychiatric issues and has been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions. The SOR allegations and the relevant record evidence are as follows: 1.a. Hospitalization for psychiatric issues. The SOR alleged that between 1997 and 2015, Applicant has been hospitalized several times due to her mental health condition. In her Answer, she admitted the allegation and explained that she sought treatment for trauma during her childhood consisting of physical and emotional abuse from her father.

She also experienced additional stressors due to her failed marriage and \nraising a child with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome.

Her last hospitalization \nwas in March 2016. The hospitalization started out voluntary but ended up as a 72-hour \ninvoluntary hold due to Applicant expressing suicidal thoughts. She explained that her \nmental health problems were due to her physical and emotional abuse from her father \nfrom age 4 to 14. She developed a fear that her decisions would result in punishment. \nHer last contact with her father was seven years ago, when she was 45. She believes \nthat her mental-health condition has greatly improved since she cut ties witih her father \nand became her own person. (Tr. at 17-27, 39-40.) \n1.b. 2015 diagnosis of several mental health conditions. The SOR alleged that \nApplicant was diagnosed in 2015 with Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe \nwithout psychosis; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Personal History of Attention \nDeficit Disorder and Hyperactivity Disorder; and Dependent Personality Disorder. In the \nAnswer, she admitted the allegation but questioned whether she had ever been \ndiagnosed with Dependent Personality Disorder. She testified that she first learned about \nthese diagnoses by reading the Government\u2019s evidence. She explained that psychiatrists \ndo not like to share their technical diagnosis with her as the patient, they just provide \ngeneral terms about her condition. She is currently taking four medications and her \nprimary care physician manages her prescriptions. She has been taking this particular \ncombination of medications since 2015 or 2016, and she believes they are very effective \nin managing her health. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 29-30, 47.) \n1.c Treatment at medical center from 2014 to 2020. The SOR alleged that \nApplicant was diagnosed with Insomnia, Depressive Disorder, Anxiety State, Attention \nDeficit Disorder and Hyper-Activity Disorder, and History of Borderline Personality \nDisorder. In the Answer, Applicant admitted that her primary care physician works at the \nmedical center and provides refills of the prescriptions she has been given by a \npsychiatrist at the center. She explained further that she has not sought psychiatric \ntreatment or psychological counseling since 2015 due to her psychiatrist\u2019s opinion that \nshe has managed her mental health well since 2015 by complying with her medication \ntreatment. She takes her medications \u201clike clockwork.\u201d She does not currently receive any \ncounseling, but she would not hesitate to seek counseling if she needed it. She has had \nno inpatient or outpatient hospitalizations since March 2016. Her last outpatient \u201ctalk\u201d \ntherapy was in 2016. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 30-34, 51.) \n1.d Opinion of a DoD-selected psychologist. On January 26, 2022, Applicant \nsubmitted to a mental-health evaluation by a psychologist working for DoD (DoD \nPsychologist). In her evaluation of Applicant, the DoD Psychologist diagnosed her with \nMajor Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, in full remission; other specific trauma and \nstressor related disorder; and History of Attention Deficit Disorder, combined type. The \npsychologist concluded that despite Applicant\u2019s current status of being in remission, her \ndiagnosis creates a risk of impaired judgment and reliability. She also concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s risk of \u201cany future mental health problems is elevated due to these diagnoses \nand current presentation.\u201d (GE 2 at 9, 11.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation in part but disagreed with the \npsychologist\u2019s conclusion.  Applicant\u2019s primary care physician for the past ten years \nprovided a different opinion in a letter, dated July 8, 2022. She wrote: \n[Applicant\u2019s] mental health history was tumultuous for many years with the \nlast bout of psychiatric treatment being in 2013. She relates much of these \ndifficulties to an abusive relationship with her father and to a lesser extent, \nstressors of a failed marriage and raising a child with Asperger\u2019s.\n \n \n \n \n  \n* \n*\n* \nIn 2015, she cut ties with her abusive father. Since then, she has done \nexceptionally well to the point that I have managed her medications since \n2015 and she no longer needs to see a psychiatrist. She has been \ncompletely stable with no exacerbations. She is medically compliant and \ncomes in regularly for her prescriptions. [Applicant] has excelled in her \nemployment with more responsibilities and promotions. Additionally, she is \na single mother and has raised a son, [name deleted], who is now 19. \n \n \n \n*\n*\n* \nI have no reservations in recommending her for reconsideration of her \nsecurity clearance. \n(AE A.) Applicant has also had a recent mental-health evaluation by a psychologist, who \nis a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Medical Services Corps and holds a Top \nSecret clearance (Evaluator). The Evaluator had reviewed the DoD Psychologist\u2019s Report \nwhen he interviewed Applicant. (Tr. at 38-43, 62.) \nThe Evaluator wrote in his report, dated February 22, 2023: \n[Applicant] appears to have [made] significant efforts in remediating her \npsychological issues such as distancing herself from her parents, applying \nherself in her career, maintaining lawful behaviors, and staying compliant \nwith her treatment recommendations and medication regimen. These \nbehaviors and interventions have resulted in a remission of many of her \npreviously identified issues that appear to have been sustained over several \nyears. The diagnoses below attempt to capture the Subject\u2019s current level \nof functioning as well as acknowledging her history as it pertains to this \nevaluation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Evaluator provided the following diagnosis: \nDIAGNOSIS: \nADHD, combined type (F90.2) \nPersistent depressive disorder, with anxious distress, in full remission (F34.1) \nPosttraumatic stress, resolved (F43.10) \nOpioid use disorder, moderate, in full remission (F11.20) \nAnxiolytic use disorder, severe, in full remission (F13.20) \nIn his conclusion, he wrote: \nThe chaotic presentation that occurred between the years of 1997 and 2016 \nwould certainly have resulted in an adverse outcome, had she been \nevaluated then. However, since that time, it appears that she has made \nsignificant improvements across all major areas of her life; personal, \nprofessional, and relational. As a result of these actions, and her \ncompliance with medical treatment, she appears to have mitigated the worst \nof her symptoms which would have prevented a favorable recommendation. \nThere does not appear to be any current evidence of disqualifying \nsymptoms or behaviors and she has exhibited stability over the \ncourse of at least 6 years. She has maintained compliance with her \nmedical treatment team and does not appear to have any reservations \nabout utilizing them when complications arise. Lastly, there does not appear \nto be any concerns from her professional references about her ability to \nperform in her required duties. As such, this Evaluator believes that the \nSubject\u2019s judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness are currently \nintact. \n(AE O at 8 (emphasis added.)) \nMitigation \nApplicant has received multiple recognitions and new positions since starting to \nwork for her current employer in 2021. She enjoys a good reputation and has earned a \nlot of credibility with her superiors and co-workers. She has never experienced any \ndiscipline or received any negative comments or concerns from her employer. Her \nperformance reviews are highly favorable. (Tr. at 40-42; AE C.) \nApplicant works remotely from her home. She manages her stress by exercise and \nwalking her dog. She likes to ride horses and has earned a black belt in martial arts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counselling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nThe record evidence establishes both of the above potentially disqualifying \nconditions. This evidence shifts the burden of proof to Applicant to mitigate the security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 29 lists the following three conditions that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from the opinion of the DoD Psychologist and Applicant\u2019s history of \nhospitalizations: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAll of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s condition has proven \nover the last six years to be readily controllable with treatment, and she has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with her treatment plan. She has presented a recent \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by the U.S. Government \nthat Applicant\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation. The record evidence establishes that there is \nno indication of a current problem. Applicant has satisfied her burden to establish \nmitigation of the security concerns raised by her past experiences with mental health \nissues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant\u2019s success in managing her past mental health issues is \nmost clearly evidenced by her successful employment record in recent years, and in \nparticular her success working since 2021 for one of the largest and most important U.S. \nGovernment contractors. She could not have achieved that success had she not taken \ncontrol of her life in 2015 by cutting off ties with her abusive father and begun the journey \nto become her own person with the help of a competent medical team that has found the \nbest medications for her condition. She appreciates the importance of her medication \ntreatment and follows it \u201clike clockwork.\u201d She has overcome her difficult mental health \nissues and is now a living a successful and meaningful life. Overall, I have no questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. Since July 2018, he has cohabitated with another. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2017 and has worked for his present employer since July 2017. He completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2018 and was granted a security clearance in October 2018. (Item 3) Applicant disclosed in his May 2018 SCA that he used marijuana from about September 2009 to January 2012, primarily while attending high school. He began using it weekly and then daily by the time he said he stopped using it. He purchased the marijuana he used. He disclosed that his use negatively impacted his productivity, which is why he stopped. He also noted that he loved his job and wanted to keep it. (Item 3) In September 2020, Applicant completed a new SCA. He disclosed that in November 2018 the following occurred. On my first trip to California, I legally purchased items containing THC from a dispensary with the intent of traveling across state lines via airplane and distributing it as gifts to my friends when I returned home to the state of [X], where recreational THC was also legal at the time.

Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November 8, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2022. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 5. (Item 1 is the SOR.) Applicant did not object \nto any of the exhibits and they are admitted in evidence. Applicant provided a response \nto the FORM. It is marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and is admitted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 2.b. He denied the SOR \nallegation in \u00b6 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. Since July 2018, \nhe has cohabitated with another. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2017 and has \nworked for his present employer since July 2017. He completed a security clearance \napplication (SCA) in May 2018 and was granted a security clearance in October 2018. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed in his May 2018 SCA that he used marijuana from about \nSeptember 2009 to January 2012, primarily while attending high school. He began using \nit weekly and then daily by the time he said he stopped using it. He purchased the \nmarijuana he used. He disclosed that his use negatively impacted his productivity, which \nis why he stopped. He also noted that he loved his job and wanted to keep it. (Item 3) \nIn September 2020, Applicant completed a new SCA. He disclosed that in \nNovember 2018 the following occurred. \nOn my first trip to California, I legally purchased items containing THC from a \ndispensary with the intent of traveling across state lines via airplane and \ndistributing it as gifts to my friends when I returned home to the state of [X], where \nrecreational THC was also legal at the time. (Item 4)  \nHe further stated in his September 2020 SCA: \u201cI was asked to bring souvenirs back from \nmy trip, I thought of the items containing THC as a \u2018gag gift.\u2019\u201d He said in his SCA, \u201cThis \nwas trafficking THC products from one legal state to \n \n another legal state but traveled on \nU.S. airlines across state lines which I believe makes this event illegal.\u201d (Item 4) \n \n \n \nIn October 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \nexplained that in November 2018 he purchased THC edibles and multiple THC vaporized \ncartridges. He explained his purchase was one time, and he never used any of the THC \nproducts. He stated that his first involvement was in November 2018 and his last \ninvolvement with THC was in November 2018. He told the investigator that he thought it \nwould be okay to purchase it because it was legal. He told the investigator that he did not \nrealize it was illegal to transport THC on an airplane, and he only recently found this out. \nHe admitted to the investigator that he was aware purchasing THC was against the rules, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations, and procedures while possessing a security clearance. When asked why he \ndecided to purchase the THC, he explained that he did not think he would be \nreinvestigated for ten years. Applicant was asked by the government investigator about \nother drug involvement, and he said he had ----\nnever used THC and cannot comment on\nhow drugs affect his behavior. Applicant did not disclose his 2009 to 2012 marijuana use \nto this investigator during this interview. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was re-interviewed by a government investigator on November 12, 2020. \nHe was asked to clarify his statement from his October 2020 interview where he explained \nthe reason he purchased the THC while holding a security clearance was because he did \nnot think he would be reinvestigated for ten years. He admitted he was aware it was a \nviolation of rules, regulations, and procedure to purchase THC products while possessing \na security clearance. He told the investigator that he knew that he could not purchase any \nillegal drug or have any involvement with illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. \nHe said that when he saw the THC products while in California, his thought process was \nthey were legal in California and legal in the state where he had a layover and legal in the \nstate where he was going, so he thought it would be okay to purchase THC as gag gifts \nfor his friends. He said that the latter part of his thought process overtook the part of him \nholding a security clearance at the time. He acknowledged that he made a poor and wrong \nchoice, and it would not happen again. (Item 5) \nGovernment interrogatories were sent to Applicant, and he was provided a \nsummary of his interviews with government investigators. In June 2022, he made several \nchanges to the summary before indicating it was an accurate reflection of his interview. \nHe did not correct the record or provide an explanation about his failure to disclose to the \ngovernment investigator his prior drug use from 2009 to 2012. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted his marijuana use from 2009 to \n2012 and that he purchased marijuana in November 2018. He stated: \u201cI did something \nthat I was absolutely not supposed to do and that it was dumb and dangerous.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant denied that he failed to provide accurate information to the investigators. He \nsaid, \u201cAt no point did I believe the information I had reported on a previous e-QIP for an \nincident that had occurred more than 7 years prior to the current investigative process \nwas relevant to the investigation.\u201d He further stated, \u201cAt no point did I falsify any \ninformation because I accurately reported that I could not comment on how drugs affected \nmy behavior as my body and mind had matured in the 8 years since the previous incident.\u201d \nHe also said, \u201cI had tried to ask the interviewer to elaborate so that I could more accurately \nunderstand the scope of what he was asking, as I believed it was a trick question designed \nto get a response contradicting the incident in subparagraph 1.b, which I was just \nquestioned about.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant never referenced his inability to understand the question that the \ninvestigator was asking during his previous interviews. He also did not address his \ninability when he reviewed his summary of interviews that were provided as part of his \ninterrogatories.

He said: \nI did not immediately think to recall how I felt answering each question \nduring the long and intensive interview. Instead, I opted to mention an \naddress change as I have moved nearby at some point during the \nadjudicative process. Even if I thought that this is what the \u201cadditional \ninformation\u201d was referencing, I would not begin to understand the scope \nbeing asked. . ..\u201d (AE A)  \nApplicant\u2019s FORM response notes that when he completed his 2020 SCA he did \nnot report his 2009 to 2012 drug use because it was outside the seven-year time frame. \nHe decided that because the drug use was outside the seven years he did not have to \ndisclose it in his 2020 SCA or during his subsequent investigative interview. Applicant \nsaid he did not falsify material facts during his October 2020 subject interview. He did not \nprovide an explanation for why when he was specifically asked by the investigator about \nhis prior drug involvement, he said he had ----\nnever used THC and he could not comment \non how drugs affect his behavior.  \nApplicant further stated that \u201cat no point did I contradict any of what was previously \nreported.\u201d He emphasized that he had self-reported the 2018 purchase and transportation \nof THC, which is indicative of his honesty. He said he has been cooperative, and he is \ntrustworthy. He said he is aware that his conduct was \u201cdumb and dangerous\u201d and made \nhim vulnerable to exploitation and there is not an excuse for his actions. He believes he \nis trustworthy because he self-reported his purchase and transportation of THC. He \nindicated this was an isolated incident. He has not been involved in any security violations. \nHe said he is praised for his work performance. \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s statements and explanations credible. I find he deliberately \nfalsified material facts during his personal subject interview on October 10, 2020, with an \nauthorized investigator with the Department of Defense when he stated he had never \nused THC and could not comment on how drugs affected his behavior. \nApplicant stated in his FORM response the following: \nI take my job and national security very seriously. At work I have been \npraised numerous times for my performance on my project that involves \nclassified information. The information that I am in charge of is invaluable \nto the nation and our treaties with foreign nations which I take great pride \nin.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant frequently used marijuana from 2009 to 2012 while in high school. In \nNovember 2018, after being granted a security clearance in October 2018, Applicant \nknowingly purchased, possessed, and transported on a U.S. airline traveling cross \ncountry THC from one state to another and provided it as a gift for his friends. He stated \nhe was aware the transportation on a U.S. airline cross country likely violated state law. \nHis purchase, possession, and transportation of THC violated federal law. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder the drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to over this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . .. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThere is no evidence Applicant used marijuana since 2012. It has been more than \n11 years since his last use, and it is unlikely he will use it in the future. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) \nand 26(b) apply to his past marijuana use. \nApplicant made a conscious decision to purchase, possess, and transport THC on \na plane where he flew cross country and then distributed it as a gift to friends in violation \nof federal law. This occurred a little more than a month after being granted his first security \nclearance. He was on notice when he completed his May 2018 SCA that the possession, \npurchase, and transportation of marijuana violated the rules and regulations he was \nbound to follow while holding a security clearance. He clearly stated in his September \n2020 SCA that \u201c[t]his was trafficking THC from one legal state to another legal state but I \ntraveled on U.S. airlines across state lines which I believe makes this event illegal.\u201d (Item \n4) He also told the government investigator that he was aware his actions were against \nrules and regulations for those holding a security clearance. Applicant stated in his \nresponse to the FORM that he has actual access to classified information and the \nimportance of his work and securing material, which makes his conduct more egregious. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was infrequent and happened in 2018, but it did not happen under \nunique circumstances. To the contrary, he was well-aware of his choice and when asked \nby a government investigator why he did it, he said that he did not think he would have a \nreinvestigation for his security clearance for another ten years, which raises a concern \nabout his thought process in attempting to manipulate the security clearance adjudication \nprocess. His behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe above mitigating conditions do not apply.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress b a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nApplicant told the government investigator when he was interviewed in October \n2020 that he had never used THC and did not know how it would affect him. He did not \ndisclose his prior drug use. Applicant claimed because he previously disclosed his prior \ndrug use on his May 2018 SCA, he did not think it was relevant to the investigator, and \nhe did not believe he had to disclose it. I did not find his explanations credible. I have \nconsidered that he self-disclosed his purchase, possession, and transportation of THC in \nNovember 2018 in his September 2020 SCA. Applicant was aware he was violating rules, \nregulations, and procedures by purchasing THC while holding a security clearance. I find \nthe above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct his falsification. He \nwas first interviewed in October 2020. He was reinterviewed in November 2020. In June \n2022, he was provided a copy of a summary of his interviews. He did not make any \nrelevant corrections or attempts to clarify any misunderstanding. Applicant\u2019s conduct in \nknowingly purchasing, possessing, and transporting THC across the country in a plane \nshows a serious lapse in judgment. When questioned why he would do this, his response \nwas because he did not think he would be reinvestigated for ten years, which essentially \nis saying he did not think he would get caught. He did disclose the information in his \nSeptember 2020 SCA, but then later provided false information to the investigator. It is \nnot for Applicant to make a determination as to what information is relevant or not. His \nonly responsibility is to answer the questions honestly, which he did not. His actions were \nnot minor and did not happen under unique circumstances. Being truthful is at the heart \nof the security clearance adjudication process. The above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances.

He has worked for a \ndefense contractor since March of 2021. (Item 3 at pages 7, 17 and 29.) \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n1.a. Applicant used marijuana, about once a month from \u201c10/2014 \u2013 9/2015 . . . \n4-5 times a week [from] 9/2015 \u2013 5/2016 [and] 0-3 times a week [from] 5/2016 \u2013 \n5/2021.\u201d  (Item 5 at page 9.) \n1.b.

(Item 5 at \npage 9.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant smoked marijuana over a period of seven years, ending in May of \n2021, after he began his current employment in March of 2021. He also used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms in April of 2021, and LSD as recently as February 2021. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these applies. His frequent use of marijuana continued after he began \nhis current employment. In his Answer he disavowals future usage, but it is too soon to \nsay his past substance misuse is not of current security clearance significance. \nHowever, in the future, after a period of time of continued abstinence, he may \nsuccessfully reapply for a security clearance. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nis found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~ 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. At Department Counsel\u2019s request and without objection from Applicant, I took \nadministrative notice of the information about intermittent explosive disorder set out in the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The \npertinent portions of DSM-5 are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. \nApplicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until May 26, 2023, to enable \nhim to submit documentary evidence. He did not submit any evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on May 22, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old calibration technician employed by defense contractors \nsince October 2010. He was employed as an electrician by another defense contractor \nfrom September 2009 until he was hired by his current employer. \nApplicant served in the Army National Guard from June 1988 to January 1990 and \nreceived an honorable discharge. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from \nFebruary 1990 to September 2009 and received an honorable discharge. \nApplicant married in December 1992 and has four adult children. Three are \nbiological children and one is adopted. (Tr. 20) He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncriminal justice in June 2013. He held a security clearance in the Navy, and he retained \nit as an employee of a defense contractor. \nIn 2008, while Applicant was on active duty in the Navy, he was involved in an \nargument and threatened to choke a coworker who blamed him for shoddy work on a \nproject that was found to be deficient. (Tr. 23) In 2009, he had an altercation with another \ncoworker, choked him, and hit him repeatedly. (Tr. 24) He was sent to a Navy hospital for \nassessment, assigned an anger-management counselor, and required to attend six \nanger-management sessions over a period of two months. (GX 3 at 2; Tr. 22) \nApplicant was assessed in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility \nduring his out-processing from the Navy. He was questioned about the incident in 2008, \nand was diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder and suicidal tendencies. (Tr. 25; GX 4) He \nwas prescribed medication for depression, but discontinued it because it caused lethargy, \nagitation, anxiety, and irritability, and made him difficult to focus on his tasks at work. He \ninformed the VA providers of these symptoms, and they advised him to monitor his \ndepressive symptoms and restart the medications if needed.

After Applicant\u2019s father passed away in 2013, he experienced increased \ndepression, and he started having auditory hallucinations of his father\u2019s voice, questioning \nhis worth and telling him to kill himself. His VA health providers diagnosed him with \nparanoid personality disorder and recommended inpatient admission, but he declined. \nEventually, His VA health providers prescribed a medication that reduced his depressive \nmood and auditory hallucinations. (GX 3 at 2; Tr. 29-30) When Applicant\u2019s assigned VA \nphysician was assigned to a different location, Applicant stopped taking his medication \nfor a while, hoping to see his assigned physician again or receive the same treatment \nfrom another VA physician. (Tr. 32) \nIn February 2014, Applicant was at a gas station when another driver accused him \nof cutting him off at the gas pump. Applicant, who was still in his vehicle, rolled up his \nwindow, trying to avoid conflict. The other driver was infuriated and began hitting the hood \nof Applicant\u2019s car. At this point, Applicant exited his car and had an altercation with the \nother driver, which was quickly broken up. \nAfter the altercation, Applicant was upset and heard voices telling him to look out \nfor himself. He went into a Navy Exchange store, attempted to shoplift some expensive \nheadphones and two candy bars, and was arrested. While awaiting trial, he self-admitted \nhimself into a VA mental health facility and was diagnosed with mood adjustment \ndisorder, moderate to severe depression, and borderline bipolar disorder. In June 2014, \nhe was convicted of stealing government property, a misdemeanor, fined $250, placed \non probation for six months, and required to continue mental health treatment as directed \nby his probation officer. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 7) The VA diagnosis is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe court-ordered mental-health treatment is alleged twice in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. \nIn March 2014, Applicant and his wife had an argument as he attempted to explain \nto her that his medications made him feel less social when he was in public. After his wife \ntold him to \u201cjust man up,\u201d he went for a drive in his truck and was beset with negative \nthoughts and hallucinations that told him to drive off the road. He drove into a ditch and \nsuffered minor injuries. Highway Patrol officers saw the vehicle in the ditch and issued \nhim a warning, but he was not charged. This incident is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant notified his VA providers of the March 2014 incident, and they prescribed \na medication that helped alleviate his auditory hallucinations. (GX 3 at 3) During an \nevaluation in June 2014, he told his providers that his angry outbursts began in his early \n20s and were occurring two or three times a week and that he had homicidal thoughts \nabout people who had wronged him. (Tr. 33-36) \nIn April 2016, Applicant stole baseball and football cards from a military exchange \nthat then took them to the customer service office for a refund. At the hearing, he testified \nthat he did not know why his took the cards. He denied that it was prompted by \nhallucinations. He was not on medications at the time.

On motion of the government \nattorney, the charges were dismissed. (GX 6) This incident is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant stopped taking medications or receiving treatment for almost three years. \nHe went to a VA medical center in early 2019 and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder \nwith mixed features of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. He attended monthly therapy \nsessions for about nine months, when the funding for the program was cut. (Tr. 43) He \nbegan seeing a VA provider every three to six months until February 2021, when he was \nunable to obtain appointments for further face-to-face treatment. He was offered virtual \nappointments but declined them. (Tr. 44). He continued to have short telephonic sessions \nin which the VA provider confirmed that he had the correct prescription and renewed it. \nHis treatment in VA medical facilities from April 2011 to September 2019 is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. \nAt the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \npsychologist in February 2022. The psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s temperament \nis more stable when he takes his medications, which reduce his depressive mood \nsymptoms and tendency toward aggressive reactions. He noted that Applicant was mostly \ncompliant with his medications but that he occasionally forgot to take them or \nprocrastinated when a refill was needed. Applicant told the psychologist that he stopped \ntaking his medications for long periods of time during 2015 and 2016. The psychologist \nfound that Applicant has mild depressive episodes that may last for several hours up to \nthree or four days, but they are manageable and do not cause functional impairment. He \nalso found that Applicant\u2019s auditory hallucinations were remitted when he was placed on \nmedication. \nThe psychologist considered whether Applicant suffers from a bipolar disorder, and \nhe concluded that Applicant does not have the manic episodes that are an element of a \nbipolar disorder. He noted that Applicant shows insight and awareness of his \npsychological problems and has been able to clearly identify how they have caused \nimpairments in his personal and occupational environments. He diagnosed Applicant with \nintermittent explosive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, mild to moderate. \nAccording to DSM-5, aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have a rapid \nonset and typically last less than 30 minutes. The outbursts commonly occur in response \nto a minor provocation by a close intimate or associate. \nThe psychologist contacted two of Applicant\u2019s supervisors. One has known \nApplicant for 8-9 years and the other has known him for more than 10 years. Both \nsupervisors spoke highly of Applicant\u2019s competence and dependability. Neither was \naware of any interpersonal issues between Applicant and his coworkers. Both believed \nthat Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness were intact and recommended \nthat Applicant be allowed to retain his security clearance. (GX 3 at 6) \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness were currently intact, but that \u201chis emotional stability was highly \nvulnerable to external pressures or circumstances.\u201d He also concluded that Applicant\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nstability was \u201cnot likely to be highly resilient or capable of enduring through significant \nstressors and may result in him either experiencing deepening depression or aggressive \nbehaviors in the future.\u201d (GX 3 at 7) The evaluation by the psychologist is alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e. \nIn March 2023, Applicant visited a VA facility and announced that he wanted to \nrestore his self-confidence, decrease angry thoughts, and have better motivation to stop \nhis aggressive behavior that had been escalating over the past year. (GX 9 at 16) His \u201cVA \nProblem List\u201d reflected treatment for \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood.\u201d His \ntreatment notes for April 2023 stated, \u201cThe patient reported some symptoms of \ndepression; symptoms are not consistent with a major depressive episode.\u201d (GX 9 at 9) \nApplicant testified that the last time he thought about harming himself was in \nDecember 2018. He admitted that he had \u201cat least three\u201d angry episodes, over the past \nyear. He described these episodes as \u201cbeing angry for at least a minimum of 15 to 20 \nminutes.\u201d His angry periods sometimes last three or four days, but they cycle on and off \nrather than run continuously. Many of his angry episodes are prompted by his inability to \nperform to the standards he has set for himself. He testified that during his angry \nepisodes, he stops talking, becomes reclusive, and does not engage with others. He has \nlearned to channel his anger in a different direction by talking out loud, writing, walking, \nand focusing on positive events. (Tr. 48-52) \nApplicant testified that he has decided that \u201csitting and contemplating hurting \nyourself and hurting others is no way to live.\u201d He now focuses on a good marriage, a \n\u201cfairly decent\u201d job, and his \u201cbeautiful granddaughter.\u201d Regarding his granddaughter, he \ntestified, \nIt\u2019s pretty joyous to get to come home and see her. And you know, when I \nsee my granddaughter, no matter what I\u2019ve gone through today, [it] just \nmelts away all that anger and angst for me. She is pretty amazing. And the \nstuff that I\u2019ve gone through pales in comparison to seeing her grow and \nlearn and just experience life. And I\u2019d like to be there and experience a little \nmore life with her. \n(Tr. 54) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d are supported by the medical records and \nApplicant\u2019s testimony. However, the SOR does not allege any of the underlying conduct \nthat raised questions about Applicant\u2019s mental health. As such, the SOR falls short of the \nspecificity required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3, and the unalleged conduct may not be the basis \nfor denying his application. Therefore, I have considered the unalleged conduct for the \nlimited purposes of determining which adjudicative guidelines are established and in my \nwhole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \nFurthermore, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege the same incident of court-ordered \nmedical treatment. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). For \nthese reasons, I have resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to \ntake prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions \nAG \u00b6 28(a) may not be a basis for revoking Applicant\u2019s clearance because no \nunderlying conduct was alleged. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s two assaults on coworkers, two \ninstances of shoplifting, and one incident of reckless driving are covered by Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established by the psychologist\u2019s report requested by DOD CAF, \nwhich is specifically alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is not established. No hospitalization was alleged and there is no \nevidence of hospitalization in the record. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established by the psychologist\u2019s report and Applicant\u2019s failures to \ncomply with his medication plan, which are specifically alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s psychological conditions are \ncontrollable with treatment. However, until recently, Applicant has not demonstrated\nongoing and consistent compliance with his treatment plan.\n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant has voluntarily entered a treatment \nprogram and is receiving treatment, but the guarded prognosis from the psychologist in \nMarch 2022 falls short of a favorable prognosis. There is no evidence of a more recent \nprognosis. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. The DOD CAF evaluation is more than a year old. \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s condition was under control, but he was \nreluctant to opine that there was a low probability of recurrence. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(e) are not established. Applicant\u2019s condition is not temporary \nand he admitted at the hearing that he still experiences depression and angry episodes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service and the favorable testimonials from his current supervisors. He was \ncandid and sincere at the hearing. He demonstrated during his testimony that he is aware \nof his intermittent angry episodes and has devised methods of controlling them. His \ndevotion to his family, especially his granddaughter, have motivated him to adhere to his \ntreatment and medication regimen. However, not enough time has elapsed to determine \nif he will continue to adhere to his treatment plan and will be able to continue controlling \nhis angry episodes. \nThis is a close case, and close cases must be resolved in favor of national security. \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) \nApplicant\u2019s understanding of his federal and state income tax requirements were \nthat if he had a \u201ccredit\u201d (meaning he was due a refund from his previous year\u2019s tax \nwithholdings overpayment), he was not required to file a tax return.

He also claimed that assistance from the IRS during 2020 was difficult \nbecause of the pandemic. He further stated that he always planned to file his tax \nreturns, but his life just got busy and he did not get around to doing it in a more timely \nfashion. He documented that he does not owe the IRS or his state for any tax debt. (Tr. \n35-39, 41-43, 49-50; SOR Answer; GE 2 (p. 6-bottom center pagination); AE B, E) \nApplicant was aware as early as 2019, when he completed his security clearance \napplication (SCA), that there was a problem with his 2016 taxes. During his background \ninterview in January 2020, he committed to filing his 2016 federal return \u201cwithin the next \nmonth.\u201d He did not file that return until December 2021. He attributed this delay to the \nIRS being unresponsive during the pandemic. He admitted that he has not sought \nprofessional tax assistance since approximately 2015. He did not consult with a tax \nattorney or CPA about his tax return filings.

He filed his 2021 state return after his hearing. (AE 2 (pp. 15-35); \nAE A-B, D) \nApplicant produced two character letters from a former coworker and a friend of \n26 years. The coworker opined that Applicant is a professional and trustworthy person. \nHe believes Applicant is \u201crespectful of privacy, classified information, rules and \nrestrictions.\u201d His friend, who is an employee of defense contractor, also vouches for \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness. Neither indicated that they were aware of his tax return filing \nissues. (AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015-2016 and 2018-2021 federal and state \nincome tax returns. I find that he timely filed his 2017 federal tax return. I further find the \nabove disqualifying condition is raised with the remaining alleged years. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s misunderstanding of his income tax filing requirements is obvious \nfrom his testimony and documentary explanations. He has two bachelor\u2019s degree in \nengineering and is an intelligent person. Despite his knowledge that there were \nproblems with him not filing tax returns as early as 2019 and 2020. He failed to take \nresponsible action to address his tax-filing issues, or learn what his tax-filing \nresponsibilities were. He never consulted a tax attorney or CPA on the matter. He \nclaims he contacted the IRS during the pandemic, but received very little assistance \nfrom them. This is likely the case from early 2020 through mid-2021, but his tax-filing \nissues both precede and succeed that time frame. The evidence does not support that \nhe has taken responsible actions to timely file his federal tax and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. He receives some credit for finally filing his federal and state tax \nreturns, however, that credit is minimized by his extended delay in filing those returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) has some application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s character \nevidence, but I also considered his untimely filing of his 2015-2016 and 2018-2021 \nfederal and state income tax returns. Applicant has not established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility in dealing with his tax issues. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant  \n[Except for tax year 2017] \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

His testimony at the hearing regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 2.b indicated that he admitted that he was arrested but did not admit the conduct alleged. I have treated his answer to these allegations as denials. Applicant is a 38-year-old communications instructor employed by a defense contractor since April 2020. He graduated from a military academy in May 2007 and served on active duty until November 2012, when he received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while on active duty. He married in October 2009 and divorced in August 2013. He has a 13-year-old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife. In January 2003, while Applicant was attending the preparatory school for a military academy, he drank too much beer at an off-base location. He became ill and began to vomit as he and his friends were returning to the base. He and his friends were held by the gate guards until the command duty officer took custody of them and returned them to their quarters. Even though Applicant was underage, he was not cited by civilian authorities for underage drinking. His military superior restricted him to the base for 45 days for underage drinking.

He had no alcohol-related \ndisciplinary actions while on active duty. (Tr. 20) \nIn June 2012, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery on a family member \nand violating protective orders. The incident occurred when his wife began screaming at \nhim and trying to hit him, and he tried to fend her off. He believes that his wife\u2019s actions \nwere her reaction to his decision to file for divorce. (Tr. 21) She called the police, who \nrequired that one of them leave the house. Applicant volunteered to leave. His wife filed \ncharges of assault and battery and obtained a protective order to keep him away from \nthe family home where she was living. He violated the order when he went into the \ngarage at night to retrieve some of his possessions. His ex-wife called the police, who \narrested him.

His ex-wife \nnotified the police that Applicant had violated the protective order. When Applicant \nlearned that his ex-wife had contacted the police, he turned himself in. (GX 2 at 14, GX \n3 at 16-18) He was convicted and sentenced to 30 days in jail, with 28 days suspended. \n(GX 8 at 10). This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. \nIn March 2013, Applicant was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), first \noffense. He was drinking at a bar with several friends and had parked in an area that \nwas a tow-away zone after a certain time. Even though he realized he was drunk, he \ntried to drive to another parking area. He was arrested and registered a blood-alcohol \nlevel of .14 percent on a breathalyzer. (Tr. 28) He was sentenced to confinement for \none year (suspended) and unsupervised probation for 12 months. His driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for one year. He was required to install an ignition interlock on his \nvehicle and to attend alcohol safety action program (ASAP) classes. (GX 5; GX 6 at 1; \nTr. 27-29) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nIn March 2014, following a positive reading on Applicant\u2019s ignition interlock, he \nwas referred for substance abuse treatment and counseling, and the breathalyzer \nrequirement was extended for one or two months. He was required to attend weekly \ngroup therapy and attend two Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per month. He \ncompleted the program in June 2014. He attributed the positive interlock reading to \nusing mouthwash at work before driving home after work. (GX 7 at 3; Tr. 30) The \ninterlock violation was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nIn July 2015, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public. He was walking \nalone at night after spending the evening drinking with friends. Someone accused him \nof trying to break into cars. The police saw Applicant arguing with a group of people and \narrested him. (GX 2 at 10) At the hearing, he testified that he had consumed about four \ndrinks and was \u201cslightly buzzed\u201d at the time. (Tr. 33) He was found not guilty, but he \nwas ordered to seek counseling and treatment. (GX 6 at 3) He attended weekly \ncounseling from August 2015 to August 2016 and completed the treatment program. \n(GX 1 at 45-46; GX 2 at 15) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nIn March 2017, Applicant was riding his bicycle in a park with friends when he \nwas stopped by police because he and his friends were being loud. (GX 2 at 20) He \nwas charged with being drunk in public. He testified that he had consumed one or two \ndrinks. (Tr. 37) He was found guilty by the general district court. (GX 6 at 5).

He was sitting in his car with his girlfriend, now his fianc\u00e9e, who had found a \ncondom in his car and suspected him of cheating. She started screaming and hitting \nherself in the face. At the hearing, his fianc\u00e9e testified that she suffers from anxiety and \ndepression, and when she becomes upset, she tends to hurt herself by hitting herself in \nthe face, scratching her face and pulling out her hair. She testified that Applicant was \nshouting at her and trying to stop her from hurting herself. Witnesses to the incident \nheard the shouting, saw her bleeding, and concluded that Applicant had injured her. (Tr. \n60-61) The charge was nolle prosequi in January 2021. (GX 3; GX 8 at 13) This incident \nwas alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nWhile Applicant was awaiting trial for the incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e, he \nattended AA meetings in 2020 and had a sponsor. He is not currently receiving any \ncounseling or treatment. (Tr. 52) \nApplicant testified that he now works in the sensitive area of cybersecurity and no \nlonger associates with his bar-hopping former associates. He now focuses on studying, \ncybersecurity, working out, staying in shape, and adopting healthier habits. (Tr. 54.)

He joins them for \nmeals and recreation time, works from their home, and goes on trips with them. Even \nwhen they go to restaurants, Applicant does not drink. She regards Applicant as a \ntalented and dedicated person who has turned his life around. (Tr. 64-65) \nIn February 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist in \naccordance with a CAS request for a psychological evaluation. The DWI and \nbreathalyzer-refusal charges were pending when Applicant was interviewed by the \npsychologist. (Tr. 42-43) The psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder, \nmoderate. The psychologist\u2019s report recites the numerous specific incidents that had \noccurred after Applicant had been drinking. Applicant admitted during the evaluation \nthat while on active duty he would consume 6-10 drinks per incident. He told the \npsychologist, \u201cWhen I drink, I may drink a lot.\u201d He also told the psychologist that he had \nreduced his consumption due to his \u201clegal issues.\u201d The psychologist concluded that \nApplicant had not been able to abstain from alcohol for more than six months at any \ntime in his adult life despite DWI charges, alcohol education courses, treatment \nprograms, a requirement for monthly urinalysis tests, and a court order requiring him to \nabstain from alcohol until his court date for the charges of assaulting his girlfriend. (GX \n7) \nAt the hearing, Applicant disagreed with the psychologist\u2019s statement about his \ncontinued drinking. He testified that he stopped drinking in early 2020, but he admitted \ndrinking a champagne toast at a New Year\u2019s Day celebration, but he did not specify \nwhich year or years that he did so. He believes that the psychologist interpreted his \ncomment about drinking a toast on New Year\u2019s Day to mean that he continues to drink \nregularly. (Tr. 50) The psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol use disorder is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. \nI have taken administrative notice that DSM 5 describes 11 diagnostic criteria for \nalcohol use disorder. At least two of the diagnostic criteria must have occurred within a \n12-month period to warrant a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. The DSM also provides \nthat an alcohol use disorder is considered to be in sustained remission if none of the \ncriteria have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer, except for the \ncriterion of a \u201ccraving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.\u201d The psychologist did \nnot specifically identify which diagnostic criteria he relied on to make his diagnosis. \nIn March 2023, Applicant was offered employment by a defense contractor, \ncontingent on verification of a security clearance. (AX A) The employment offer was still \nopen at the time of the hearing.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden\nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive alcohol \nuse. He completed a treatment program in August 2016, attended AA meetings in 2020, \nand has not consumed alcohol since his arrest for DWI in December 2019, more than \nthree years ago, except for a one or more isolated incidents involving a New Year\u2019s \nchampagne toast. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d-\n1.h. It also alleges the assault and battery in June 2012 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), the violations of \nprotective orders (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, and 2.d), and the assault in March 2020. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s multiple arrests and his violation of the interlock program in 2014 are \nsufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to \ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established for the domestic incident in 2012 and the \nrelated violations of a protective order. Applicant has been divorced since 2013 and has \nminimal contact with his ex-wife. He has not been involved in any other incidents of \ndomestic assault. These two mitigating conditions also are established for the alcohol-\nrelated incidents. Applicant has significantly curtailed his use of alcohol, and there have \nbeen no alcohol-related incidents since December 2019. A former supervisor and his \nfuture mother-in-law have known him for many years and hold him in high regard. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the charge of DWI alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and the \ncharge of domestic assault alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e, which were not supported by reliable \nevidence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was sincere, remorseful, candid, and \ncredible. When he was on active duty, he engaged in heavy drinking while off duty. After \nhe left active duty, he associated with a group of men whose social life revolved around \nfrequent bar hopping and heavy drinking. His social life changed after his arrest in \nDecember 2019. Five days in jail apparently gained his attention. He is now involved in \na serious relationship. He has earned the respect of a former supervisor and has been \noffered a demanding and responsible job. He is focused on his work and a healthy \nlifestyle. The strong and favorable testimony of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother, an experienced \nmedical professional who has known him for six years, was compelling evidence of \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines G and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is an 85-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since July of 2021. He has held a security clearance in the past, but not currently. He is divorced and has three children. (TR at page 17 line 16 to page 25 line 8, and GX 1 at pages 7, 12, 24~25 and 28~30.) Applicant attributes his current financial situation to periods of unemployment, a failed business, and to health issues. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The SOR alleges that Applicant is excessively indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a delinquent tax lien, and that he filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March of 2011. 1.a. Applicant initially denied, \u201cdue to mitigating circumstances,\u201d that he owed back-taxes totaling about $16,875 (GX 3), but now admits the allegation. In the past, he failed to pay sufficient Federal income taxes; that were due after filing his tax returns, putting them last on his priorities of debts to pay. He was satisfied with letting his state tax refunds go towards his Federal tax debt.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 16, 2022 and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on October 24, 2022. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 24, 2022, scheduling the hearing for November 3, 2022. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6, which \nwere admitted into evidence.

DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on November 16, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is an 85-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since July of 2021. He has held a security \nclearance in the past, but not currently. He is divorced and has three children. (TR at \npage 17 line 16 to page 25 line 8, and GX 1 at pages 7, 12, 24~25 and 28~30.) \nApplicant attributes his current financial situation to periods of unemployment, a failed \nbusiness, and to health issues. \n Guideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is excessively indebted to the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) for a delinquent tax lien, and that he filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in March of 2011. \n1.a. Applicant initially denied, \u201cdue to mitigating circumstances,\u201d that he owed \nback-taxes totaling about $16,875 (GX 3), but now admits the allegation. In the past, he \nfailed to pay sufficient Federal income taxes; that were due after filing his tax returns, \nputting them last on his priorities of debts to pay. He was satisfied with letting his state \ntax refunds go towards his Federal tax debt. Now realizing the gravity of his \ncircumstances, Applicant has initiated a payment plan by which he is making monthly \npayments of $500 towards his back-taxes, as evidenced by documentation from the \nFederal taxing authority. (TR at pages 22 lines 15~20, page 27 line 15 to page 28 line, \nat page 42 line 22 to page 44 line 17, and AppXs B, C and I.) \n1.b. Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March of \n2011; and as a result, his debts were discharged in June of 2011. (GX 4.) As noted \nabove, Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to periods of unemployment, a failed \nbusiness, and to health issues. (TR at page 31 line 10 to page 39 line 4, at page 40 line \n11 to page 41 line 6, and at page 42 lines 15~19.) Having occurred more than a decade \nago, I find that it has no current security significance. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011, and had significant tax \ndelinquencies The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past, financial problems have been rectified. He has initiated a \npayment plan by which his past-due Federal taxes are being addressed, to the \nsatisfaction of the Federal taxing authority. He has demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nrespected in the workplace. He performs well at his job. (AppXs J and K.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He married his current wife in November 2020, with whom he has a 10-month-\nold daughter.  \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2014 to November \n2016 and received an other than honorable discharge. He received a security clearance \nwhile on active duty. \nIn April 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for assaulting another sailor. The incident \ninvolved a fist fight that occurred when Applicant asked a fellow sailor to help out on a \nproject and the fellow sailor did not respond. (GX 6 at 12) His punishment was restriction \nfor 30 days, extra duties for 30 days, reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his \nbasic pay per month for two months.

(GX 6 at 9) His wife claimed that \nhe struck her in the face and head, knocking her to the floor. At the hearing, he denied \nhitting her, but admitted that he pushed her. He was charged by civilian authorities with \nmisdemeanor assault and battery on a family member. The civilian prosecution was \ndeferred in February 2019 to enable Applicant to complete court-ordered counseling. (GX \n7 at 6; Tr. 40-41) \nDuring the November 2016 altercation, Applicant\u2019s wife was holding their baby \ndaughter. A protective order was issued against Applicant, and in January 2017, he was \nlisted as a child abuser in the state child abuse and neglect registry. (GX 11; GX 12) He \nwill remain on the registry until November 2023. (Tr. 41) \nApplicant testified that he did not tell his commanding officer or the police that his \nwife was the aggressor in the domestic incidents. His wife was on active duty in the Navy \nand he kept silent in an effort to enable her to retain her military benefits. (Tr. 43) \nOn the day after the November 2016 altercation, Applicant attempted to commit \nsuicide by overdosing a prescribed muscle relaxant. He called his wife and told her that \nhe had ingested the drugs. His wife called an ambulance, and he was taken to an \nemergency room and then admitted to a military hospital. He received medical treatment \nand was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He was \nhospitalized for two or three days and discharged. The medical authorities recommended \nthat he attend outpatient psychotherapy. He testified that he did not obtain psychotherapy \nas recommended, but he began obtaining therapy about six months later and was \ndiagnosed with anxiety. He stopped the therapy when his therapist retired around 2019. \nHe resumed therapy for about six months in 2020 but stopped when his insurance would \nno longer cover it. (Tr. 43-47; GX 5; GX 6 at 9) \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2012 to 2013. He resumed \nhis marijuana use in 2017, after he was discharged from the Navy, using it once or twice \na month. (GX 6 at 20). He testified that he has not smoked marijuana since 2020, because \nmost of his friends with whom he smoked marijuana are married and have children, and \nseveral are DOD employees. (Tr. 66) \nIn April 2017, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of drugs, \npossession of marijuana, tampering with evidence, driving with defective equipment, and \noperation of a vehicle with an expired license tag. The evidence tampering charge was \nbased on a police officer accusing him of attempting to eat marijuana that was in the \nvehicle when he and an acquaintance were stopped by police.

When Applicant exited the car, the piece of marijuana that was on his lap fell onto \nthe ground. The police officer asked Applicant to open his mouth and he saw small pieces \nof marijuana on his tongue, and his tongue was covered with a green film. Applicant \ndeclined to be tested for drugs. (GX 13) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he believed he was innocent of the drug \ncharges, but he was told that his trial would not be until eight months later unless he \npleaded guilty. (Tr. 57-58) In June 2017, he pleaded guilty, was convicted of driving under \nthe influence of drugs, and was sentenced to eight days in jail and community service. \nHe was placed on probation for 60 months. For the marijuana possession, he was fined \n$1,200 and placed on probation for 12 months. For tampering with evidence, he was fined \n$750 and placed on probation for 12 months. (GX 7 at 9; GX 9) \nIn January 2019, Applicant failed to report to his probation officer as required. (GX \n10) At the hearing, he testified that he failed to report because he was unsuccessful in \ntrying to contact the new probation officer who was assigned to his case. (Tr. 60-61) The \nprobation officer\u2019s affidavit, dated January 24, 2019, recited that the probation officer had \ncalled Applicant at least twice at a telephone number that is the same telephone number \nas Applicant provided in his answer to the SOR. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant \nhad not contacted his probation officer. As a result, the running of his time on probation \nhas been tolled since January 24, 2019, and he is still on probation.

He testified that a military recruiter \nadvised him not to disclose it. (Tr. 14, 67) \nApplicant admitted that he did not disclose his arrest for assault and battery in his \nSeptember 2018 SCA, because he believed it was not reflected in his record. (Tr. 68) He \ndisclosed his arrest for DUI and stated that he was awaiting trial.

(AX G) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant attempted to commit suicide in November 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), received inpatient treatment in November 2016 and was diagnosed with \nadjustment disorder with depressed mood (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and was evaluated by a licensed \npsychologist in October 2021, who concluded that he did not appear to have any mental \nhealth condition but exhibited evidence of personality characteristics and behavioral \ntendencies that could impact judgment and trustworthiness. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness.

A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; and \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not fully established. After Applicant\u2019s suicide attempt and \nhospitalization for three days, he did not follow the recommendation of medical authorities \nthat he attend outpatient therapy. After about six months, he began some kind of therapy \nnot reflected in the record, but he stopped it when his therapist retired in 2019, resumed \ntherapy for about six months, and then stopped it because his insurance would not cover \nit. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c) and 29(d) are not fully established.

However, he expressed concern that Applicant\u2019s \npersonality and behavioral tendencies could have a negative effect on his judgment and \ntrustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 29(e) is not established. The psychologist found no mental health conditions, \nbut he expressed concern that Applicant\u2019s personality characteristics could have a \nnegative effect on his judgment and trustworthiness. The behavior alleged under \nGuidelines J, H, and E validates the psychologist\u2019s concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for an assault on \na fellow sailor (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he was charged with assault and battery a family member \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b); that he received nonjudicial punishment for the same assault on a family \nmember (SOR \u00b6 2.c); that he was listed in the state child abuse and neglect registry as a \nchild abuser because his infant daughter was present during the assault and battery on \na family member (SOR \u00b6 2.d); that he was charged and convicted of DUI, possession of \nmarijuana, tampering with evidence, defective equipment, and an expired license tag \n(SOR \u00b6 2.e); and that he violated the terms of probation imposed for the criminal conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e (SOR \u00b6 2.f). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege the same conduct but different consequences. As such, \nthey are duplicative. When the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under \nthe same guideline, the duplicative allegation should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Accordingly, I have resolved \nSOR \u00b6 2.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe registration of Applicant in the child abuse and neglect registry was a \nconsequence of the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, but it was not a separate act of \nmisconduct. Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 2.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.e, and 2.f and are sufficient to establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation; and \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to \ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant used marijuana as recently \nas 2020. He is still on probation and has not complied with the terms of his probation. \nGuideline H, Drug Use and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \napproximately 2012 through 2013 and again in 2017. SOR \u00b6 3.b cross-alleges that he \npossessed marijuana as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. SOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency in 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b mistakenly cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 2.c, which alleges an assault. It \napparently was intended to cross-allege SOR \u00b6 2.e, which alleges Applicant\u2019s arrest for \nmultiple offenses, including possession of marijuana. I have resolved SOR \u00b6 3.b for \nApplicant. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of\nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances\nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner\ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may\nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises\nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use has been recent, frequent, \nand did not occur under unusual circumstances making recurrence unlikely \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant still associates with marijuana users, \nalthough many of his former marijuana-using friends have stopped using it because of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfamily obligations or federal employment. He has not changed his environment, and he \nhas not provided a statement of intent to abstain from drug involvement. \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is not established. Applicant has received counseling and treatment, \nbut none of it was specifically for drug use. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nand \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . : engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(b): the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not make any effort to correct the \nomissions in his two SCAs or the DOHA interrogatories until he was confronted with the \nfacts. \nAG \u00b6 17(b) is partially established for Applicant\u2019s omission from his SCA in 2013, \nwhich was based on advice from a military recruiter. However, he made no effort to correct \nhis omission. Instead, he repeated the same omission in his September 2018 SCA. It is \nnot established for the omissions in his SCA in 2018 or his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories in 2022. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Falsification is not \u201cminor.\u201d It \u201cstrikes at the heart of \nthe security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications were numerous and recent. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I, J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guidelines I, J, H, and E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Use) \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(GE 1 at 35-39, 41, GE 2 at 8; Tr. 24, 35-40, 49-52, \n59-60) \nThe evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: mortgage account placed for collection for $124,265. Applicant \ndenied the allegation, stated the mortgage account was closed in about February 2016 \nand removed from his credit report in 2022. (Answer) He testified that he accepted a \npayout from the creditor and moved out of the marital home after his 2015 divorce to \nresolve the delinquency. A March 2020 credit report shows the account was closed in \nDecember 2015 with no balance due, but credit reports from September 2021 and March \n2022 erroneously show the account as in collection.

(AE A-C, F; GE 1 at 36-37, GE 1-5; Tr. \n24-28, 38-39, 44) This debt was resolved in December 2015. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit account charged off for $17,544. Applicant denied the \nallegation, said the account was no longer delinquent and that payment arrangements \nwere made on January 8, 2022. (Answer) Credit reports from March 2020 and September \n2021 show a July 2015 balance date and balance of $17,544, and that the account was \ncharged off for $17,544. (GE 4 at 2, GE 5 at 5) In December 2021, Applicant \nacknowledged the debt was unpaid, reported entering a payment agreement and making \nmonthly payments of $100, and acknowledged he had not submitted documentary \nevidence of payment status or proof of payments. (GE 2 at 3-4, 9) \nHe testified this debt was for a line of credit or loan he obtained to start a small \nbusiness in about 2014, that he probably stopped making payments at about the time of \nhis divorce, and that the account had been charged-off. He said after this debt came up \nduring an interview with a government investigator he decided \u201cI need to address this. So \nI did work out at the time with them a payment, an auto-deduction from my account \nmonthly of [$100] . . . . They continue to make deductions from my bank account[.]\u201d (Tr. \n40-41) During the hearing, he acknowledged he had not provided evidence of payments, \nstated his understanding that bank statements showing payments to the creditor could \nprovide such evidence, and stated his intent to keep making payments until the debt was \npaid. (Tr. 39-49, 51-53) \nAfter the hearing, he submitted a letter dated February 26, 2022, showing an \naccount balance of $23,662, and that he authorized the creditor to debit his bank account \nfor $100 monthly from March to December 2022 to apply towards the debt.

(GE 2 at 9; Tr. 42-46, 55-57, 62-66, 70-72, 76-78, 84) \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from his current supervisor, a \nformer co-worker and friend, and his former spouse that comment favorably on his \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, performance, expertise, security awareness, and \nloyalty. (AE D) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information.

The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to at least 2014. The SOR \nalleges seven delinquent accounts totaling $153,540. In December 2015, he resolved the \nlargest SOR debt, a delinquent mortgage totaling about $124,265. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In \nFebruary and March 2021, he resolved three debts totaling $9,992, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f). \nIn June and July 2023, he resolved two debts totaling $1,739 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g). Applicant \nhas not resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, charged-off for $17,544 and with a \nbalance of $23,662 as of February 26, 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances have \nsignificantly improved. However, his financial problems are longstanding, and he took no \naction to resolve six of seven debts alleged in the SOR until after submitting an SCA in \nJanuary 2020 and discussing his financial problems with a government investigator. Most \nsignificantly, his failure to address a $17,544 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) from at least July 2015 \nuntil February 2022, and his varying and uncorroborated claims of payments on that debt \nsince December 2021 cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s divorce and associated marital debt, \nfailed business venture, underemployment, and unemployment were largely beyond his \ncontrol. However, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) is not established because he has not received financial counseling. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s work history, security clearance history, and that his financial problems were \ncaused, in part, by circumstances beyond his control. I also considered his favorable \ncharacter evidence, improved financial circumstances, and that he has paid most of his \ndelinquent debts. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nHowever, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith a longer track record of financial responsibility, he may be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The SOR explained why the CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance eligibility. The CAF took \nthe action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn June 13, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR.

In addition, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to include three \nallegations under the Personal Conduct guideline, annotated as subparagraphs 2.a through \n2.c. (FORM at 2) Applicant received the FORM on August 22, 2022, and provided a \nresponse by August 23. 2022. In his response, Applicant admitted subparagraphs 2.a and \n2.b, and denied subparagraph 2.c. (Response at 1) On October 31, 2022, the case was \nassigned to me.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 34-year-old, married man with one child, age nine, He served in the \nU.S. Navy from 2011 to 2016. He was honorably discharged. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in information technology in 2019, and a master\u2019s degree in information assurance \nand cybersecurity in 2021. (Response at 3) He has been working for a defense contractor \nsince 2017. (Item 5 at 14) \nApplicant has been using marijuana with varying degrees of frequency since 2007. \nFor the first three to four years of his use, he periodically sold marijuana. (Item 6 at 2; Item \n8 at 10) Applicant stopped using marijuana while he was in the Navy and resumed use in \n2018. Since then, he typically either smokes it or uses it in candy form. He typically uses it \nwith his wife. (Items 7 at 6; 8 at 9) He enjoys using marijuana, contending that it helps him \nmanage anxiety, helped him quit smoking tobacco, and makes him \u201cfeel relaxed, like [he] \nfeels when he drinks two beers, but without the weight gain.\u201d (Item 7 at 6) Over the years, \nhe has used it approximately 300 times. \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in March 2022, approximately four years after \nhe completed a security clearance application, and four days before he was scheduled for \nan interview with an investigative agent. (Item 7 at 5) At that time, he was using marijuana \napproximately once per week. (Item 7 at 5) In response to a question on the March 2022 \ninterrogatories regarding future illegal marijuana use, Applicant responded, as follows: \nI have no details, but I figure it\u2019s better to err on the side of the affirmative. \nThe national culture is shifting and all but the top seems to be moving with it. \n5mg or 2 beers doesn\u2019t make much difference since I don\u2019t leave my house \neither way. (Item 7 at 9) \nIn response to subparagraph 1.c alleging that Applicant intends to continue using marijuana \nin the future, he denied it, explaining that he does not have a plan in place to continue \nusing marijuana, but was \u201cnot against\u201d using it in the future, and \u201cwouldn\u2019t use it, at least, \nfor a while.\u201d (Item 3 at 2) \nApplicant believes the current classification of marijuana under federal law as a \nSchedule I drug with a high potential for abuse is \u201cridiculous,\u201d and the presumption that use \nof marijuana constitutes \u201csuch a danger that [he] can\u2019t be trusted by using it is incorrect[,] \nand . . . the majority of the developed world would agree\u201d with him.

(Response at 1) \nApplicant has a medical disability that results in severe neck pain, for which he is \nprescribed a combination of anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxers. (Item 3 at 1) \nIn 2019, his prescription was delayed in the mail. Subsequently, Applicant experienced \nextreme pain, compelling him to use one of his mother\u2019s prescription pain relievers, on one \noccasion, to get it under control. (Item 3 at 1; Item 6 at 3) \nShortly before Applicant entered the Navy in 2011, he completed a security \nclearance application. He did not include his purchase, sale, and use of marijuana on the \napplication, as required, and as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. Applicant \ncontends that he told his recruiter who advised him to \u201ckeep it to [him]self.\u201d (Response at 1) \n Applicant completed a security clearance application in 2018. SOR subparagraph \n2.c alleges that he underreported his marijuana use by not disclosing his use in 2007 in \nresponse to Section 23 of the application requiring disclosure of illegal drugs within the past \nseven years preceding completion of the application. Applicant answered \u2018Yes,\u2019 to this \nquestion, disclosing that his most recent use was approximately seven months before \ncompletion of the application.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel[.]\u201d The applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nUnder AG \u00b6 24, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant used a prescription painkiller not prescribed to him on one occasion \nafter his prescription was delayed in the mail, leaving him in extreme pain. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u2019 applies.\u201d I resolve \nsubparagraph 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nConversely, Applicant\u2019s longstanding and habitual use of marijuana, including his \noccasional purchase of it over the years, and his failure to unequivocally stop using \nmarijuana triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c), \n\u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d Applicant was smoking \nmarijuana habitually as recently as four days before his subject interview. He is nonchalant \nabout the fact that it remains illegal under federal law, contending that it does not reflect \nnegatively on his character. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions \napply. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concern. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201c[o]f special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant admits falsifying a 2011 security clearance application by failing to disclose \nhis drug involvement. This triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant completed this application as \npart of the enlistment process for joining the Navy. He told his recruiter about his drug \ninvolvement and was told not to include it on the security clearance application. This \nexplanation potentially triggers the application of the following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17(b): \nThe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation triggers the first prong of AG \u00b6 17(b). However, he never shared \nthis information until he answered the amended SOR in response to the FORM. \nConsequently, the second prong of AG \u00b6 17(b) is inapplicable. \nApplicant falsified this information more than 12 years ago. Since then, he has \ncompleted another security clearance application, disclosing his marijuana use. Moreover, \nhe has been forthcoming about how often he has used marijuana, the likelihood that he will \ncontinue using it, and how much he enjoys it. In addition, he has readily shared his opinion \nabout the current federal marijuana law and his belief that there is no nexus between \ncharacter and illegal marijuana use. Under these circumstances, I conclude lack of candor \nand dishonesty are not at issue, and that although Applicant falsified his 2011 security \nclearance application at the behest of his recruiter, it no longer generates a current security \nconcern. I resolve subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSubparagraph 2.c alleges that Applicant answered \u2018yes\u2019 on a 2018 security \nclearance application requiring applicants to disclose any drug use within seven years of \ncompleting the application, but that he deliberately underreported the amount of use by \nfailing to discuss the number of times he used marijuana between 2007 and 2011. The \nquestion only requires applicants to disclose drug use within seven years of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \napplication\u2019s completion. Consequently, Applicant was not required to list any drug use \nduring that time frame. I conclude that his response to this question does not generate a \nsecurity concern. I resolve subparagraph 2.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. In reaching this \nconclusion, I also considered the candor with which he has discussed his involvement with \nmarijuana throughout the investigative process, as discussed in my analysis on \nsubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. In sum, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the personal \nconduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nAIthough marijuana use has been decriminalized in several states, it remains illegal \nunder federal law. As such, Applicant\u2019s opinion that marijuana should be legal has no \nbearing on whether his longtime use should be mitigated. To the contrary, it reflects a \nwillingness to pick and choose which law to obey based on opinion. As such, it disqualifies \nApplicant from security clearance consideration. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a -2.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

She believed she never was properly treated for her more serious mental \nhealth issues because of the misdiagnosis and her state of denial. (Tr. 38-39) \nApplicant testified that she began consuming alcohol in about 2002. She never \nconsumed alcohol while she was pregnant or breast feeding. In 2004, she was working \nas a bartender and the management encouraged the bartenders to let customers buy \nthem drinks to increase business. She said she would often get drunk while working at \nthe bar. After she married in 2006, she moved to a new state with her husband, and she \ndid not consume alcohol because she was at home and did not socialize. Gradually she \nmade friends and became more social. She testified that she never felt like she needed \nor craved alcohol but when she did drink, she had no control and could not stop. She \nfound her body reacted differently when she consumed alcohol than it does for other \npeople, in that instead of acting as a depressant, it energized her. (Tr. 45-49) \nApplicant testified that after she remarried, she and her husband both drank \nalcohol, and it would fuel fights between them. In 2016, while talking on the phone with a \nfriend, she consumed a 750 ml bottle of rum. Her husband was in bed and got up and \nconfronted her. She was belligerent. She blacked out and does not recall what happened \nbut was told she was combatant with her husband and her father who had been contacted \nand came to their house. (Tr. 39-41) \nApplicant was taken to CC, a hospital, and was admitted to the behavioral unit \nwhere she stayed for three days. She described the facility as horrible, and she was \nterrified while there. She was placed in a room with a woman who talked to herself and \nwas told that the woman was aggressive. Applicant testified she met with a psychiatrist \nfor five minutes. There was concern that because there were scratches on her wrists that \nshe had made a suicide attempt. The scratches were superficial. This was also fueled by \nthe fact that her husband could not find his medication, and it was believed she had \nconsumed it. She denied she attempted to commit suicide. All of her toxicology tests were \nnegative, and her husband eventually found his medication, refuting that she made a \nsuicide attempt. (Tr. 39-41, 47; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that her experience with the medical personnel raised concerns \nabout the quality of the facility. She said she met with a nurse practitioner who vaped \nduring her entire interview. She was prescribed Zoloft and the nurse believed because \nApplicant had a busy life with five children at the time that she was suffering from post-\npartum depression. Applicant testified that she believed she did have depression after \nher child was born, but it was not to the level of post-partum. She also candidly admitted \nthat she was in denial on acknowledging she had other serious mental health issues. She \nmet with a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, with depressed \nmood, and alcohol intoxication delirium, with mild use disorder. After her release from the \nunit, she felt good but continued to consume alcohol. She did not believe at that time that \nshe had a problem with alcohol. She attributed her diagnoses to others who believed that \nshe had swallowed pills, despite evidence to the contrary. Applicant continued to take \nZoloft which helped her.

She also discontinued \ntaking the Zoloft upon her obstetrician\u2019s recommendation. She did not consult with any \nother doctors about the consequences of stopping Zoloft. Her son was born in July 2018 \nand Applicant nursed him until February 2019. She experienced stress due to the baby \nhaving some special medical needs, some financial issues, and she was not on any \nmedication. When she stopped breast-feeding, she started to drink alcohol again. She \nalso explained after the lockdown due to the pandemic the children were all home, and it \nwas also more stressful. (Tr. 42-44, 57-60) \nApplicant testified that once she starts to drink alcohol, she does not have control. \nShe becomes belligerent and argumentative. From February 2019 to April 2020, she \nconsumed alcohol sporadically but when she did, it was to intoxication. Her husband tried \nto limit her to three drinks, but she said she threw the restriction back at him because he \nconsumed alcohol and said that he had the problem with alcohol and not her. She \nadmitted they were both in denial regarding their problems with alcohol. (Tr. 44-46, 60-\n61) \nIn April 2020, Applicant and her family were celebrating her daughter\u2019s birthday. \nApplicant was consuming alcohol. She was upset at her husband for spending money for \nsomething she did not approve of. Later in the evening, she and her husband were \narguing. Applicant testified she blacked out and does not remember what happened. She \nonly knows what was told to her. She called the police and accused her husband of hitting \nher son, which was not true. The police came, and her husband went to his mother\u2019s \nhouse. Her mother stayed with her and the children. Applicant went to take a shower and \nher mother-in-law came over to the house to retrieve Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s medication. \nBecause Applicant had been in the bathroom for a long time and was unresponsive, her \nson unlocked the door. Applicant was on the floor and was blue. An ambulance was \ncalled, and she was taken to the hospital and intubated. It was determined that she had \ntaken her husband\u2019s entire prescription of Xanax and some hydrocodone that had been \nprescribed to her after an operation. (Tr. 51, 61-64) \nApplicant testified she woke up in the hospital a few days later unaware of what \nhad transpired or how long she had been in the hospital. She was then transferred to the \nbehavior wing at RL, a hospital. She met with a psychiatrist and a therapist for the three \ndays she was there. She discussed with the psychiatrist her family history and what had \nhappened. He explained to her that her condition was not temporary and would not go \naway. He explained that they needed to fix her brain, and she would be on medication for \nthe rest of her life. He specifically said she was not suffering from post-partum depression. \nInstead, he diagnosed her with Major Depressive Disorder. She was put back on Zoloft, \nwhich has provided good results. She said she was sad and angry because she blamed \nher family for teaching her to deny mental health issues and leave them untreated. She \nexplained that her grandmother had committed suicide and she later learned her aunt has \nthe same diagnoses as her. (Tr. 64-68, 89-90; GE 4; AE A, B, N) \nApplicant recognizes that her use of alcohol exacerbated her other mental health \nissues. She testified that her current diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder severe \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout psychotic episodes and she is also being treated for Alcohol Use Disorder. The \npsychiatrist at RL referred Applicant to her primary care doctor for medicine management \nof her Zoloft dosage. Since April 2020, Applicant\u2019s dosage has increased from 50mg to \n100mg and in late 2022 it was increased again to 150mg when Applicant was \nexperiencing stress due to her security clearance being under review. The increases were \nall under the care of her doctor. (Tr. 69-71, 91-92, 95-96; GE 4; AE B, N) \nWhile at RL, Applicant also met with a psychologist and was to meet with her for a \nyear. She did not have a good rapport with her. She participated in talk therapy and initially \nthey met twice a week, then once a week, then bi-weekly. Applicant discontinued seeing \nthe psychologist because she did not find it helpful, and they would often sit together and \nnot talk. She stopped seeing the psychologist around June or July 2020. She continued \nto take her medicine as prescribed. She admitted that she was not happy with the care \nshe had initially received at CC where the psychologist was affiliated because she \nbelieved they mishandled her care. She tried to meet again with the psychiatrist from RL \nwho diagnosed her, but he had left the hospital\u2019s employment and she was unable to \narrange an appointment. (Tr. 68-69, 71-74, 77, 92-94; GE 3, 4; AE A, B, N) \nBefore being discharged from RL, Applicant worked on a recovery plan with the \npsychiatrist and his nurse. Her family participated in the discussions regarding support \nthrough a virtual meeting to ensure everyone was aware of it. Almost immediately after \nApplicant\u2019s discharge from RL, she began participating in \u201cIn the Room.\u201d This is an online \ntreatment program that offers Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and other activities \nthat are always available. She learned about this group while at RL. Her recovery was \nhappening during the pandemic, so the use of online groups was the norm. Also, it \nallowed her flexibility to seek a meeting when it met her schedule as there are meetings \noffered every two hours. The AA program required that she attend meetings for 90 \nconsecutive days. AA offered meetings, communicating with others, reflections, and \nsponsors. There is also a subdivision at \u201cIn the Room\u201d that offers a community for those \nwith more than one diagnosis. The group is called Dual Diagnoses. Applicant feels very \ncomfortable participating in this community because it is not just about being addicted to \nalcohol but also addresses other mental health diagnoses. Applicant works on the 12-\nsteps of AA and has a sponsor. When she first started, she participated more often in the \ngroup, but the frequency has been reduced now that her mental health and alcohol issues \nare under control. She continues to participate in the program. She continues to be \nmedication compliant, reads the daily reflections from the group and posts her gratitudes \nweekly. (Tr. 74-83, 94, 98; AE M) \nApplicant testified that she has a robust support group. Her husband supports her \nsobriety. After Applicant\u2019s hospitalization, he was in denial about his alcohol problem, but \nin about June 2020, he recognized that he too is an alcoholic. They support each other. \nThere is no alcohol in the house. Both testified that Applicant has not consumed alcohol \nsince the April 2020 incident and hospitalization. Applicant\u2019s family and her husband\u2019s \nfamily live close by and are there to support her. She has a church community and is \ninvolved as a girl scout leader with her daughters. She recognizes triggers that may raise \nconcerns and addresses them immediately.

(Tr. 85-86) \nDue to the stress associated with the retention of her security clearance, Applicant \nwent to see a therapist in August 2022 to help her. She participated in cognitive therapy \nwith him. He gave her the same diagnoses as noted above. He is a licensed clinical social \nworker. She saw him until January 2023. (Tr. 84-85) \nApplicant reported her 2016 hospitalization incident to her employer\u2019s facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) but was told because it was due to post-partum depression she \nwas not required to do so. She reported her April 2020 incident to her FSO. She admitted \nthat when she completed her security clearance application in March 2020, she did not \ndisclose alcohol or mental health issues because she was in denial. (Tr. 99-100; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s coworker for the past 13 years and friend testified on her behalf. She \nis aware of Applicant\u2019s mental health hospitalizations and addiction to alcohol. She did \nnot observe Applicant drink alcohol when they were at a company happy hour. She \ndescribed Applicant as reliable, trustworthy, dependable, always willing to help, and a \nvital member of the team. (Tr. 105-109) \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law testified. She was aware that in the past Applicant was \ndiagnosed with post-partum depression. Since April 2020 she has never observed \nApplicant consume alcohol. She is available, as is her whole family that lives very close, \nto provide any support Applicant may need. She has noticed a change in Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior since she has abstained from alcohol consumption. Applicant is calm and \norganized. She describes Applicant as a loving mother, daughter, and aunt. She has \nfound new hobbies and is very involved in girl scouts with her daughters, is a homeroom \nparent, gardens, and is enrolled in college. (Tr. 109-115) \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified and acknowledged that since both have stopped \nconsuming alcohol, their marriage and life has improved. He described himself as a \nrecovering alcoholic. He is aware that his wife recognizes her triggers that may impact \nher mental health. He believes the last alcohol episode in April 2020, where she almost \ndied, scared her about what could have happened. She is managing her mental health \nthrough medication. She has constant family support, and they support each other. (Tr. \n115-122) \nApplicant provided her excellent performance evaluations and performance goals \nfrom her employer. She is committed to her sobriety and mental health. She intends to \nremain vigilant in taking her prescribed medication and recognizing triggers that may \nimpact her mental health. She admits she is a recovering alcoholic. She has not \nconsumed alcohol since April 2020 and does not intend to ever again. She understands \nthat she will remain on medication for her mental health for the rest of her life.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant consumed alcohol from 2002 to 2020, at times in excess and to the point \nof intoxication. In December 2016, she was hospitalized after consuming a bottle of rum \nand admitted to a behavioral unit for care. She was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with \nadjustment disorders, with depressed mood and alcohol intoxication delirium, with mild \nuse disorder. In April 2020, after consuming alcohol, she was involved in an incident at \nher home and ingested Xanax and hydrocodone in an attempt to commit suicide. She \nwas found unconscious and was hospitalized. The evidence supports the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol consumption since April 2020 and is \ncommitted to never drinking alcohol again. She has been sober for more than three years \nwith no recurrence of alcohol-related problems. She acknowledges she was in denial \nabout her alcohol abuse and mental health issues for many years. S\n he is on medication \nto address her mental health issues, which were exacerbated by her alcohol abuse and \nvice versa. She is compliant with her medication management. Although she discontinued \nseeing a psychologist for counseling, she sought other support. She participates in AA as \npart of \u201cIn the Room\u201d and a subgroup Dual Diagnosis. She is aware of her triggers and \nseeks help when she feels stress, which she did recently. Her husband and close family \nmembers provide her support. Her alcohol abuse and mental health problems cannot be \nseparated. Once she was properly diagnosed and provided the proper medication for her \nmental health, she has been able to manage and abstain from alcohol. Although there \nare never guarantees regarding alcohol and mental health issues, I found Applicant \ncredible in her commitment to abstention and managing her mental health now that she \nis properly diagnosed. I find future issues are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubts on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b623(a), 23(b) and 23(c) \napply. AG \u00b6 23(d) partially applies because although she has demonstrated an \nestablished pattern of abstinence, she has not completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare.  \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend counseling sessions. \nApplicant was hospitalized in December 2016 and diagnosed by a psychiatrist with \nadjustment disorders, with depressed mood and alcohol intoxication delirium. She was \nhospitalized again in April 2020 for an alcohol incident and drug ingestion in a suicide \nattempt. During this hospitalization she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent severe, without psychotic features by a psychiatrist. She was to participate in \ncounseling with a psychologist for a year but discontinued it because it was not helpful. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nThe same analysis under the Guideline G mitigation is applicable under this \nguideline. Additional analysis is provided. Applicant admitted she was in denial for years \nabout her mental health issues due to being taught that these issues should not be \nacknowledged. In addition, her mental health condition was misdiagnosed for years \nattributing her problems to post-partum depression. She now has a correct diagnosis. \nShe acknowledges she will have to manage her condition with medication for the rest of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher life.

AG \u00b6 29(a) applies. \nApplicant did not follow through on counseling with a psychologist after her release \nfrom RL in 2020 because she did not feel it was helpful. However, she immediately began \nparticipating in AA through \u201cIn the Room\u201d and participated in the subgroup for Dual \nDiagnoses. She continues to participate in both but not to the extent she previously did \nas her condition is under control and managed. She has not received a favorable \nprognosis from a mental health professional. AG \u00b6 29(b) partially applies. \nApplicant\u2019s condition is not temporary, but she now has an accurate diagnosis, and \nher mental health is stable and she no longer shows signs of instability. AG \u00b6 20(d) \npartially applies. There is no indication of a current problem. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse.  \nIn April 2020, Applicant used her husband\u2019s Xanax and misused hydrocodone \nthat was prescribed to her after surgery. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . .. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe same analyses under Guidelines G and I apply under this guideline. Applicant \nused her husband\u2019s prescription Xanax and misused her prescription for hydrocodone \nafter consuming alcohol. Her actions are related to mental conditions and alcohol abuse \ndisorder. These conditions are now under control as she abstains from alcohol \nconsumption and her mental health conditions are managed through medication. This \none-time occurrence happened more than three years ago, under unique circumstances \nand is unlikely to recur. She acknowledged her misuse of the drugs and there has been \nno recurrence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, H and I, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant recognizes that she must remain on medication for the rest of her life. It \ntook years for her to receive a proper diagnosis, partly because she was in denial. She is \nnow stable and cognizant of what is required to remain so. She has a strong support \nsystem. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption, Guideline I, psychological conditions, and Guideline H, drug involvement \nand substance misuse. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nWITHDRAWN \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

He received a high school diploma in 2003. He has not \nbeen married and has no children. He served on active reserve duty with the U.S. Air \nForce from 2005 to 2013 and received an honorable discharge. (Items 3, 8) \nApplicant has a history of mental health issues and inpatient hospitalizations. He \nhas been diagnosed with schizophrenia and unspecified psychotic disorder by a duly \nqualified mental health professional. His mental-health disorders cause periods of \npsychosis where he suffers from delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and memory loss. \nHe began experiencing these symptoms in about 2010. (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) \nIn late November 2019, Applicant checked himself into an inpatient hospital for \nmental health treatment because he was suffering from an increase in audio-visual \nhallucinations, high anxiety, and insomnia. During this inpatient treatment, he reported \nthat, for years, he had been misusing prescription Xanax and prescription Ambien by \ntaking more than the amount he was prescribed. He also reported that he had been \nbinge drinking about a pint of liquor one to two times per week to help him sleep. \nAccording to his medical records form this hospital, combining alcohol with several of \nthe prescription drugs he was taking is a misuse of those prescription drugs. This \ninpatient treatment lasted for about a week. During this treatment, a certified psychiatric \nnurse practitioner diagnosed him with an unspecified schizophrenic spectrum and other \npsychotic disorder, and an unspecified stimulant use disorder (moderate). (Items 2, 3, 5, \n7, 8) \nIn January 2020, Applicant reported that he voluntarily checked himself in to \nanother inpatient hospital because he was again suffering from psychosis. There is no \nevidence in the record as to how long this second inpatient hospitalization lasted, the \nspecific treatment he received, or whether he was diagnosed with a mental health \ndisorder. (Items 2, 3, 7) \nApplicant was evaluated at the DOD\u2019s request by a licensed psychiatrist, and the \nreport of the evaluation was issued on March 8, 2022. After meeting with him virtually, \nreviewing the results of an online psychological inventory, and reviewing Items 3, 5, 6, \nand 8, the DOD\u2019s licensed psychiatrist found his condition to be \u201csuspicious for \nschizophrenia,\u201d but diagnosed him with an unspecified psychotic disorder and \npolysubstance abuse of alcohol and prescription medication. She opined that his \nconditions are likely to impair his reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness, and \nthat his prognosis was guarded. Her prognosis was partly based upon the premise that \nhe was not receiving psychiatric treatment, but he had made an appointment to start \ndoing so. According to a letter from his treatment provider dated October 20, 2022, he \nreceived psychiatric treatment from a licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner since \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 28, 2022, and he remained stable on his current medication and treatment \nregimen. This licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner diagnosed him with schizophrenia \nand attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (Items 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has made poor decisions and has shown poor \njudgment when he is suffering from psychosis. For example, in March 2020, when he \nwas suffering from psychosis, he drove while he was intoxicated. He claimed that he \nwould not have driven while intoxicated if he had not been suffering from psychosis. He \nalso claimed that he has only abused his prescription medications and alcohol when he \nwas in a period of psychosis and claimed that he would not have abused those \nsubstances otherwise. (Items 2-8) \nApplicant claimed that he is feeling better mentally. He claimed that his treatment \nwith a licensed psychiatric nurse practitioner has helped, and that he plans to continue \nthat treatment, including following her advice regarding prescription medication. He \nclaimed he has had no episodes of psychosis after his January 2020 inpatient \nhospitalization. He claimed that he has learned better coping mechanisms. At the time \nof his meeting with the DOD psychiatrist, he had recently moved in with his father and \nlived closer to his siblings and one of his good friends. He noted that he has sought \ninpatient treatment whenever he has a period of psychosis. He did not indicate whether \nhe still suffers from audio or visual hallucinations or paranoia. He has not received \nsubstance abuse counseling other than detoxification. The DOD licensed psychiatrist \nopined that he should be receiving treatment for substance abuse. She also noted that \nhe had a lower-than-average motivation for treatment level compared to others with \nmental health issues and that he sees little need for changes in his behavior. She \nopined that these qualities are poor prognostic indicators. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8) \nIn February 2008, Applicant drove while intoxicated. He was stopped by police \nand arrested for aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was \nconvicted of this crime. He spent four days in jail and had to pay fines. (Items 2-4, 7) \nIn March 2020, Applicant was consuming alcohol while in a state of psychosis. \nHis dog got out of his house and went missing. Applicant drove his car while intoxicated \nto attempt to find his dog. While he was driving while intoxicated, he struck a power line \npole with his vehicle. Police arrested him and charged him with extreme DUI (.15 per \ncent blood alcohol content (BAC) or higher). He spent the night in jail. In July 2021, he \npleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. The court suspended his driver\u2019s \nlicense for 90 days and ordered him to pay about $1,300 in fines. The court also \nordered him to undergo an online drug and alcohol screening. As of his June 2020 \nsecurity interview, he had not taken this online screening and has not provided any \nevidence that he has since completed it. (Items 2-4, 6-8) \nApplicant provided inconsistent information about his alcohol consumption. \nDuring his 2019 inpatient hospitalization, Applicant reported his aforementioned \nconsumption of a pint of liquor one to two times per week. During his June 2020 security \ninterview, he told the investigator that he drinks four beers about four to five hours \nbefore he takes his prescription medications.

In his response to the SOR, he claimed that he \nnow rarely drinks alcohol and only has a couple of drinks when he does. He provided no \nevidence that he is permitted to consume alcohol while on his current prescription \nmedication regimen. (Items 2, 5, 7, 8) \nBeginning in about June 2013, for a little over two years, Applicant misused his \nemployer-issued company credit card by using it to pay about $86,000 for personal \nexpenses. In April 2016, his employer fired him for this credit card misuse. He claimed \nthat he thought there was an unwritten rule that he could use the company credit card \nfor personal expenses if he timely paid off his balance. However, he did not timely pay \noff the balance. He claimed that he has since satisfied the account after paying about \n$20,000 on it over two years. He provided no documentary evidence of this resolution. \nHe claimed that he now understands this misuse was wrong and he has not misused a \ncompany credit card since 2015. (Items 2, 3, 7, 8) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires 1) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition; and 2) that the condition may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQualified \nmental \nhealth \nprofessionals \nhave \ndiagnosed \nApplicant \nwith \nschizophrenia and an unspecified psychotic disorder. These mental health conditions \ncause Applicant to have periods of psychosis where he shows poor judgment, stability, \nand reliability. For example, he misuses prescription medications, binge drinks alcohol, \nand drives while under the influence of alcohol during his periods of psychosis. He also \nhas trouble remembering his actions after the period of psychosis has ended. The DOD \nlicensed psychiatrist found that his unspecified psychotic disorder may impair his \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. He has twice undergone voluntary \ninpatient hospitalizations for his mental health issues. The above listed disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant has suffered from psychosis, including audio-visual hallucinations since \nabout 2010. As his symptoms lasted for at least 10 years, and he had another inpatient \nhospitalization after his first, I cannot find that his conditions are readily controllable with \ntreatment. Moreover, none of the qualified mental health professionals have opined that \nhis conditions are controllable with treatment. His mental health professional merely \nstated that he was stable at the time of her letter. While I commend him for seeking \ntreatment for his mental health conditions, I also cannot find that the six months of \nmental-health treatment he received as of October 2022 constitutes ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with his treatment plan. AG \u00b6 29(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) does not apply because there is insufficient evidence to show that his \nconditions are controllable with treatment, and he has not received a favorable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprognosis. At best, the evidence shows that he is stable on his current treatment \nregimen. \nThere is no evidence that a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government has opined that Applicant\u2019s \nprevious condition is under control or in remission. There is evidence from a licensed \npsychiatric nurse practitioner, but not one employed by or acceptable to the \nGovernment, that his conditions are under control. Also, there is no evidence that he \nhas a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation. AG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s psychiatric conditions are \ntemporary, and the situation has been resolved. Instead, at best, there is evidence that \nhe has stabilized. AG \u00b6 29(d) does not apply. \nWhile there is evidence that Applicant\u2019s conditions have stabilized, I cannot find \nthat there is no indication of a current problem. Applicant\u2019s mental health conditions \nremain, and he has suffered from bouts of psychosis after treatment in the past. The \nlack of evidence that his conditions are treatable also detracts from a finding that there \nis no indication of a current problem. AG \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. \nI commend Applicant for seeking help with his mental health issues. However, \nnone of the Guideline I mitigating conditions are fully applicable. He has not mitigated \nthose security concerns. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder. \nFor years, Applicant misused prescription medications by overusing them and \nusing them in combination with alcohol. The DOD licensed psychiatrist diagnosed him \nwith polysubstance abuse of prescription drugs. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nWhile it has been about four years since Applicant last misused his prescription \ndrugs, he did so for several years, so his misuse was not infrequent. There is evidence \nthat his mental health conditions are stable, however, there is no evidence that they are \nresolved. As he last misused prescription drugs to help him cope with his still present \nmental health conditions, I cannot find that his misuse happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has acknowledged his prescription drug misuse, and he has undergone \nmental health treatment that has since seen his mental health conditions stabilize. \nHowever, he has not undergone substance abuse treatment. By moving to a more \nstable environment with his father, he has changed the environment where he misused \nthe prescription drugs. He did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse. AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant abused his prescription medication during a prolonged period of mental \nillness. He was legally prescribed the drugs he misused. The record contains consistent \nevidence that he has stopped abusing prescription drugs. AG \u00b6 26(c) applies. \nWhile one of the mitigating conditions is fully applicable and another is partially \napplicable, the applicability of one or more mitigating conditions does not establish \noverall mitigation. Instead, because all doubts must be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity, and because of the questions I have about the potential recurrence of \nprescription drug misuse, I cannot find that the Guideline H security concerns are \nmitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant drove while under the influence of alcohol. On two occasions, he was \narrested while doing so. At one point in time, he was consuming excessive amounts of \nalcohol to help him sleep. This consumption caused him to have impaired judgment as \nevidenced by his March 2020 DUI. He was diagnosed with polysubstance abuse of \nalcohol and prescription medicine but has not received treatment for it. All the above \ndisqualifying conditions are established. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a \ntreatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nWhile it has been about four years since Applicant has had an alcohol-related \nlegal incident, his varying and inconsistent accounts of his alcohol consumption cause \nme to question that his problems with alcohol are unlikely to recur. His failure to seek \nsubstance abuse treatment bolsters my concerns. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant acknowledged that he has a problem with alcohol. He claimed that he \nhas been able to drink less alcohol. However, as his reports of his alcohol consumption \nare inconsistent and varied, he has not provided sufficient evidence of a clear and \nestablished level of alcohol consumption in accordance with a treatment plan. AG \u00b6 \n23(b) does not apply. \nApplicant is not participating in an alcohol-related treatment program, and he has \nnot completed one. AG \u00b6 23(c) and AG \u00b6 23(d) do not apply. None of the Guideline G \nmitigating conditions apply and the alcohol consumption security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant\u2019s Guideline H and G conduct that the Government cross-alleged under \nGuideline E are explicitly covered under those guidelines and are sufficient for an \nadverse finding under those guidelines. AG \u00b6 16(c) and AG \u00b6 16(d) are not established \nwith respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.b, and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to those \nallegations. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated misuse of his employer\u2019s credit card for personal expenses \nover several years involves questionable judgment, dishonesty, and unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. This conduct makes Guideline E applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating condition potentially applies in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nIt has been about eight years since Applicant last misused his employer\u2019s credit \ncard. He claimed that he now understands that he cannot use an employer\u2019s credit card \nto pay for personal expenses and he will not do it again. I find that so much time has \npassed since he engaged in this behavior that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The Guideline E security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines I, H, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered his \nmilitary service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the psychological conditions, drug involvement and substance misuse, and \nalcohol consumption security concerns. He mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n   FOR APPLICANT \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 27 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree, and is currently working towards his Masters degree. He holds the position of Mechanical Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant began working for his current employer in March 2019. He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. As part of the application process, he completed the security clearance application (SF-86) dated December 13, 2021. In the application, he admitted illegal drug use. Applicant has used marijuana from about 2013 to at least January 2022, with varying frequency. He began smoking marijuana during his first year of college. (Tr. p. 23.) During this period, he struggled in school, and was depressed. He continued smoking marijuana, mainly in social settings with friends. He testified that he usually smokes marijuana once every two or three months. (Tr. p. 24.) He stated that he used it less than 20 times a year or less than 100 times in the last seven years.

The record remained open following the hearing, until close of \nbusiness on October 26, 2022, to allow the Applicant to submit additional supporting \ndocumentation. Applicant submitted four exhibits, marked as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibits A through D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 24, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 27 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree, and is currently working towards his Masters degree. He holds the \nposition of Mechanical Engineer. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in March 2019. He is applying \nfor a security clearance for the first time. \nAs part of the application process, he \ncompleted the security clearance application (SF-86) dated December 13, 2021. In the \napplication, he admitted illegal drug use. \nApplicant has used marijuana from about 2013 to at least January 2022, with \nvarying frequency. He began smoking marijuana during his first year of college. (Tr. p. \n23.) During this period, he struggled in school, and was depressed. He continued \nsmoking marijuana, mainly in social settings with friends. He testified that he usually \nsmokes marijuana once every two or three months. (Tr. p. 24.) He stated that he used \nit less than 20 times a year or less than 100 times in the last seven years. (Government \nExhibit 1.) He testified that he believed that it was legal to use. He usually obtained it \nfor use from his friends. On one occasion, in 2017/2018, he purchased marijuana at a \ndispensary in a state where he believed it to be legal under state law.  (Tr. p. 26.) \nAfter being hired by his current employer in March 2019, Applicant continued to \nuse marijuana. He states that he is not aware of his company\u2019s drug policy. (Tr. p. 28.) \nNone of his supervisors or management is aware of his illegal drug use. (Tr. p. 28.) \nWhen he was hired, he was advised to read the Employee Handbook, but he did not \ntake the time to do so. He also received regular annual briefings about company \npolicies and procedures. He is not subject to random urinalysis. In January 2022, he \nstopped using marijuana when he learned that federal law prohibits the use of \nmarijuana. \nApplicant explained that he last used marijuana in January 2022, after \ncompleting his security clearance application. He was celebrating his Birthday, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceived marijuana as a Birthday gift from a friend. (Tr. p. 29.) He used it to celebrate \nand decompress. In response to interrogatories he completed as part of his security \nclearance background investigation, Applicant initially stated that he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana even after being issued a security clearance. (Government \nExhibit 2.) He explained that he held this belief because of his stubbornness and \nunwillingness to take full responsibility for the current role he is in. \nApplicant shared that he has been seeing a therapist to help him take \nresponsibility for his actions.  Applicant\u2019s father is battling dementia and Applicant has\nrecently been required to help the family by taking his sister to school and other things.  \nApplicant was not happy about having to take on these additional responsibilities.  His \ntherapist is helping him gain a better understanding of how to be responsible.  (Tr. pp. \n30-34.)  \n \nHe is also learning how to believe in himself more, take responsibility for his \nactions and to fully engross himself in any role where he is needed. Applicant states \nthat he is now a role model at work, where he is mentoring the new hires and providing \nguidance to them on the programs and practices used at work. He wants to continue in \nthis role and to one day become a program/project manager in the defense industry \nwhere a security clearance is required. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant submitted copies of his employer\u2019s drug policy and code of conduct. \nThey indicate strict compliance with a substance free workplace. (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibits A and B.)   \nApplicant\u2019s mid-year assessment and year-end assessment are favorable. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits C.) \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s therapist shows that he has been receiving rehabilitative \ncounseling and mentorship skills since October 2021. He is making progress toward \nbuilding his confidence, consistency, and emotional intelligence while exploring past \nmistakes and drug use. He is showing commitment to redemption and rehabilitation. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant has deliberately used \nmarijuana for the past ten years, from 2013 to at least January 2022. He was hired by a \ndefense contractor in March 2019, he applied for a security clearance in December \n2021, and during this period he continued to use marijuana. In April 2022, he stated \nthat he intended to continue to use marijuana after being granted a security clearance. \nHis mindset at this time demonstrates immaturity and poor judgment. In May 2022, in \nhis answer to the SOR, he stated that he intends to stop using marijuana altogether in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \norder to achieve his career goals. However, at the hearing, in October 2022, he stated \nthat he plans to continue to associate with his friends with whom he used marijuana. \n(Tr. p. 37.) His judgment remains questionable. Even if Applicant has abstained from \nthe use of marijuana since January 2022, his extended history of illegal drug use is \ncriminal behavior and demonstrates poor judgment and unreliability. Marijuana is illegal \nunder Federal law, and is clearly prohibited by the DoD under any circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s actions are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security clearance \nis expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant is a 27-year-old man. He has \nnot demonstrated the level of maturity needed in order to access classified information. \nApplicant should know the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand should know that marijuana use is against Federal law and not tolerated. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant is not an individual in whom the Government can be confident \nto know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even \nwhen no one is looking. At this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a \nsecurity clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a., and 1.b.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 21, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled on March 22, 2023. After \nreviewing the transcript and evidence, I proposed to the parties that this case was \nappropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Applicant did not object. \nDepartment Counsel had 10 days to consider the matter and provided written notice \nthat Department Counsel did not object. \nThis case centers on Applicant\u2019s past use of narcotics with varying frequency, \nfrom approximately 2008 to 2016. The narcotics he used were primarily opiates and \nopioids. He was first introduced to Percocet following knee surgery to repair a torn \nmeniscus and was prescribed opioids following four surgeries to repair intestine \ndamage due to Crohn\u2019s disease. Applicant was continuously enrolled in drug treatment \nprograms from July 2016 to December 2022. He successfully completed treatment in \nDecember 2022, was given a favorable prognosis, and was released. Applicant does \nnot associate with anyone who uses drugs, has an excellent employment record, and \nenjoys strong family support. \nTo demonstrate his commitment to maintaining sobriety, Applicant has taken \nsteps outside of his family support to include joining virtual teleconference Narcotics \nAnonymous meetings and consults with his primary care physician and clinical behavior \nhealth specialists. He participates in one-on-one sessions with a therapist as well as \ngroup sessions within a local university health care system that specializes in opioid \naddiction. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that Department Counsel \npresented sufficient evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR under Guideline \nH. I also conclude that Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts admitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel. In particular, \nI conclude that the security concerns are resolved under the following mitigating \nconditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1)(2)(3), 26(c), and 26(d). \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement and substance misuse \nproblems do not create doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-\nperson concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion \nto show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

(AE B, C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2014 through 2016, 2018, and 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns when they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. Applicant filed his \n2017 federal and state income tax returns on time. AG \u00b6 19(f) is not applicable to tax \nyear 2017. The language in the allegations referring to tax year 2017 is concluded for \nApplicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax failure, which he attributed to poor \norganizational skills, mild depression, and procrastination. He described a bad period of \nhis life in which he went through a divorce, he was balancing work, and he was taking \ncare of his aging parents. All of the old returns were filed in May 2021 and all of his \npast-due taxes were paid in October 2022. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the filed income \ntax returns, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed. \nApplicant asserted that he never intended to shirk his responsibility to pay his \ntaxes. Whether he intended to or not, that is what he did. He owed about $10,000 for \ntax years 2010 through 2013; $7,294 for 2014; and $1,228 for 2015. He did not finish \npaying those taxes until October 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns on time continues \nto raise doubts about his judgment, reliability and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns is insufficient to overcome the \nyears of Applicant shirking his responsibility to this country to file his tax returns and pay \nhis taxes. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.2 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for tax \nyear 2017, which is found for \nApplicant) \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n2 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded a \nconditional clearance in this case is not warranted.  \n6 \n",

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant has eleven delinquent debts consisting of nine Federal student loans, one medical debt, and a consumer debt, which were placed for collection totaling approximately $40,584. Credit reports of the Applicant dated August 12, 2021; and April 19, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 7 and 8.) The SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose this financial indebtedness on his security clearance application dated July 27, 2021. (Government Exhibit 4.)

Credit reports of the Applicant dated August \n12, 2021; and April 19, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 7 and \n8.) The SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose this financial \nindebtedness on his security clearance application dated July 27, 2021. (Government \nExhibit 4.) \nApplicant admits allegations 1.a. through 1.k. regarding his financial \nindebtedness, and he denies allegation 2.a. concerning falsification. Applicant began \nworking for his current employer in August 2018. \nThe following delinquent debts are of security concern: \nDuring his interview with a Federal investigator on September 13, 2012, \nApplicant was confronted with all of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Government Exhibit \n5.) His credit reports show nine delinquent debts owed to the Government for student \nloan accounts that were placed for collection in the approximate amounts of $4,793; \n$6,394; $3,526; $3,362; $2,527; $6,521; $3,170; $5166; and $4,188 totaling about \n$39,647. (See Allegations 1.a., through 1.i of the SOR.) Applicant acknowledged that \nthe accounts were open for his college tuition. He stated that he believed that the \naccounts were opened in his mother\u2019s name. He stated that he did not know that they \nremained owing until it was brought to his attention during the security clearance \nprocess. He further stated that he is actively in the process of resolving these issues. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant submitted no documentation to demonstrate that he \nhas done anything to resolve these debts. The debts remain owing. \n1.j.

Applicant seems to believe that the \nrental company is responsible for the debt.

The debt remains owing. \nA delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $25. Applicant stated that he was not aware of \nthe debt, but that he is in the process of resolving it. The debt remains owing. \nEven if Applicant only learned about his delinquent debts during his September \n2021 interview with the Federal investigator, he has done nothing since then to resolve \nhis debts. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (e-QIP) dated July 27, \n2021. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \nIn response to Section 26, Financial Record, \nDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts: The question asked, \u201cOther than previously \nlisted, have any of the following happened? In the past seven years have you had bills \nor debts turned over to a collection agency?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d and failed to \nlist that he had been delinquent on debts in the past seven years, as noted in Paragraph \n1, Guideline F above. \nApplicant denied that he deliberately lied on his security clearance application \nabout his delinquent debts. \nHe contends that without his knowledge his parents \nopened his student loan accounts to pay for his college tuition. He claims that he had \nno information about the accounts and assumed that his parents had paid them off. His \nexplanation is not reasonable. Applicant knew that the student loans were opened for \nhis college tuition. He knew or should have known that regardless of who promised to \npay his student loans, he would be the one legally responsible to pay them back. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) To assume that his parents opened the accounts using his \nsocial security number and without his consent or awareness is preposterous. Their \nconduct would be criminal. In this case, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his \nfinancial indebtedness on his security clearance application. This shows poor judgment \nand unreliability. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor, dishonesty and unworthiness finds him \nineligible for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not paid. There is \ninsufficient information in the record to conclude whether he is financially stable, or if he \ncan afford his lifestyle, or if he has the financial resources available to handle his \nfinancial obligations. There is no evidence in the record to show that any regular \nmonthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe record is void of mitigation.  Applicant remains delinquently indebted and \npresented no evidence to show that he has made any effort to resolve his debts.  There \nis no evidence in the record to show that circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control \ncontributed to his financial difficulties.  What is known is that Applicant has been \ngainfully employed since 2018, and yet remains excessively indebted.  None of the \nmitigating conditions apply.  This guideline is found against the Applicant.   \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant contends that he knew nothing about his student loan debts until the \nsecurity clearance investigation. This argument holds no merit. He knew or should \nhave known that student loans opened so that he could pay his college tuition must be \npaid back. If he did not pay them back and if he did not check to see if his mother paid \nthem back, he has not demonstrated responsibility. Applicant should have addressed \nhis student loans and knew or should have known that they were delinquent. Applicant \ndeliberately concealed his financial delinquencies from the government on his security \nclearance application. There is no excuse for this dishonesty. Deliberately concealing \nmaterial information from the Government on a security clearance application raises \nserious questions about one\u2019s credibility and trustworthiness. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to respond to \nthe FORM, and submitted nothing in mitigation. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.k. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 62 years-old. He has worked as an administrative technician for a defense contractor since December 2012. He has held a security clearance since November 2012. He earned his associates degree in 2012 and is currently attending an online seminary college. He is able to attend cost free because he is a church member. Applicant has been married for 38 years. He has three adult children. One of his children is currently living at home. Applicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts total over $378,000. The debts are established by his SCA, two credit reports, and his ESI. (Items 3-4 and 6-7.) The specific debts in the SOR are as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b: past-due accounts charged-off for $26,667 and $20,157 respectively.

His admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years-old.

This debt was incurred when he took a loan against his primary \nresidence to obtain funds to start his Limited Liability Company (LLC). \nApplicant in his answer explained that in early 2012, he and his brother-in-law \nformed an LLC \u201cto acquire real estate for the purpose of investment (buy houses cheap, \nmake some needed repairs, then re-sell for a profit).\u201d The LLC was a single member LLC, \nand he was the sole member. His brother-in-law lacked the financial resources and credit \nhistory to be a formal partner. However, his brother-in-law was experienced in buying and \nselling real estate, so he handled finding properties and securing financing for the LLC. \nApplicant handled repair work and hiring contractors. However, when Applicant began his \ncareer with his sponsor in December 2012, he found he had significantly less time to \nspend on the LLC to expedite repair work and oversee transactions. \nApplicant states in 2014 an erroneous action on the part of a lender resulted in the \nLLC being unable to secure financing to buy properties and make necessary repairs to \nattract home buyers. This error and the ramifications of it resulted in the LLC being \ndissolved in 2017.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThis case involves an Applicant\u2019s inability to pay debts, arising from a series of\ninvestment decisions. His admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability\nto satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b619 (b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b619 (e)\n(\u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of \nlate payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators.\u201d) \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. The erroneous action by the lender, cited by \nApplicant, may have resulted in the LLC being unable to secure financing to continue the \nbusiness. The circumstances he claims triggered the largest debts are unlikely to recur, \nbut they are recent, numerous and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant cites being unable to devote time to \nhis business after taking his job with his sponsor. However, he does not support his claim \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve his business obligations. \nHe has not shown the basis for the legal proceedings concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nHe admitted he had not resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e and these debts were due to oversights \non his part. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant provided evidence to support his \nassertion he paid his medical debt, SOR \u00b6 1.f. The delinquent medical debt was resolved \nprior to completing his SCA. He presented no documentary evidence of negotiations or \noffers of settlement concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b or the other alleged debts. While his \nAnswer provides some evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve the debts, he has not \nshown that he is pursuing a course of action that has a reasonable chance of success. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established for the delinquent mortgages and lines \nof credit or the delinquent accounts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. This mitigating condition is not established because \nApplicant has not provided documentary evidence to support his claim he disputed any \nof the debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n          \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:     \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n     Subparagraph 1.f: \n     Subparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(AE I at 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nBetween July 2016 to February 2021, Applicant was fired from five jobs. She left \nanother job without providing notice and without paying back a $500 relocation bonus to \nher employer. Her employment history raises concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c) about her \njudgment, trustworthiness and reliability which raises issues about whether she will \nproperly safeguard classified information. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nInitially, Applicant was young and just starting out in the civilian employment \nworld. While concerning, her employment history is understandable. Overtime, \nApplicant has since matured and her current employer speaks highly of her. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c \nand 17 (d) apply She mitigated the concerns raised under the Personal Conduct \nConcern. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile Applicant intends to pay her debts, a lot of the alleged delinquent debts \nremain unresolved. After the hearing, Applicant entered into repayment plans for three \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.t). With regards to these debts, she has not developed a \nsignificant track record of regular timely payments to indicate she is likely to resolve \nthem. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nadversely affected her financial situation. After separating from active duty, she \nexperienced several periods of unemployment. She also had several health issues. This \nmitigating condition is given less weight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsibly under the circumstances. While Applicant struggled financially after \nseparating from active duty in 2015, it has been eight years. By now, she should have \ndeveloped a plan to manage her finances, yet, she continues to have financial issues. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) partially apply in that Applicant testified that she was \nseeking the assistance of a financial counselor. She likely resolved the medical debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1i \u2013 1.l. She also resolved several accounts not alleged in the SOR. \nBoth mitigating conditions are given less weight because Applicant still has several \nunresolved debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did not provide sufficient \ninformation about the debts she disputed and any evidence of actions she has taken to \ndispute each debt. \nWhile Applicant is taking steps to resolve her financial problems, the evidence is \ninsufficient for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within \na reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. None of the \nmitigating conditions are sufficient to fully mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

He works for a \ndefense contractor. (Item 2 at pages 7, 12 and 18.) \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant avers that he uses marijuana to treat \u201cFibromyalgia with severe IBS \n(irritable bowel syndrome).\u201d (Item 1 at page 4.) \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant admits that he used marijuana, from about July 1996 to at \nleast November of 2021, a period of about 25 years; and purchased marijuana since \nJanuary of 2005, a period of about 16 years, which are evidenced by a self-reported, \nAdverse Incident Report. (Item 1 at page 5.) This was also subsequent the execution of \nhis October 6, 2021, e-QIP. \n1.c. Applicant admits that he intends to continue the use of marijuana in the \nfuture. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nAppellant has used marijuana for about 25 years, and purchased it for at lease \n16 years. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. He also expressed an intent to \ncontinue to use marijuana in the future, establishing AG \u00b6 25 (g). \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. Applicant, despite having notice of the Government\u2019s \nconcerns when he executed his e-QIP, still uses a Federally recognized illegal \nsubstance and intends to continue its usage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant intends to continue to \nviolate Federal Law by regularly using marijuana in the future. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The remaining account, he was unaware of, which will be treated as a denial. His admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer as a senior field engineer since December 2018. He has worked for federal contractors since retiring from the U.S. Army in 2007. He is married for the third time (1986-1999; 2003-2011; 2012-present). He has four children, ages 35, 33, 10, and 8. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is a few hours away from earning his masters. (Tr. 5-6, 20, 24; GE 1-2) Applicant retired from the Army in 2007, at the rank of sergeant major (paygrade E-9).

Applicant testified, but he produced no documents for the hearing. The record was \nheld open to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence, which he did in the form of AE \nA-C. All were admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 2, 2023. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant admitted all but one of the allegations, to the extent that the accounts \nwere his, but not that they were delinquent. The remaining account, he was unaware of, \nwhich will be treated as a denial. His admissions are incorporated into these findings of \nfact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer as a senior field engineer since December 2018. He has worked for \nfederal contractors since retiring from the U.S. Army in 2007. He is married for the third \ntime (1986-1999; 2003-2011; 2012-present). He has four children, ages 35, 33, 10, and \n8. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is a few hours away from earning his masters. (Tr. \n5-6, 20, 24; GE 1-2)  \n \nApplicant retired from the Army in 2007, at the rank of sergeant major (paygrade \nE-9). During his 21 years of service, he served in overseas locations over nine years. He \nfirst deployed for Desert Storm in 1990-1991. Over the years, he deployed six more times \nto the Southwest Asia region. His last deployment was in 2005. He received numerous \ndecorations for his service as reflected on his discharge certificate (DD-214), including: \nthe Meritorious Service Medal (third device); the Army Commendation Medal (fourth \ndevice); and the Army Achievement Medal (fifth device). (Tr. 19-20, 45; AE A) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a mortgage account that went to foreclosure \nand 10 past due, collection, or charged-off debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k) With the exception of \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h, the debts are established by entries on credit reports from November \n2019, July 2022, and February 2023. I gave no weight to GE 5 because it offered no \nprobative information about Applicant\u2019s alleged specific debts, and it referred to a credit \nreport that was not included in the exhibit. Regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h, the record contains \nno evidence that those specific debts were in a past due, charged off, or collection status. \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he only admitted to having those accounts, not to any \ndelinquencies. I find that the Government failed to establish those debts as delinquent. \n(GE 1-6; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant explained that his financial difficulties started in 2019 when his rental \nproperty became vacant after a long-term tenant left. He was unable to secure another \ntenant and the expenses of maintaining that property, along with his residential property \ncaused increased financial distress. Additionally, he and his current spouse separated for \na time, requiring him to support two separate households. They are back together now. \nDuring this time, he used credit cards to make repairs to the rental property and his \nresidence. He admitted going through a bankruptcy in 1995, where he had approximately \n$74,000 in debts discharged (this was not alleged in the SOR and will not be used by me \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas a basis for disqualification, but I may consider this information as it could relate to his \ncredibility, the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and in assessing the whole-\nperson factors). He provided a copy of his written budget that shows his current financial \nposition is much improved. His latest credit reports show that he had several large-\nbalance accounts that he is making timely payment on and he has reduced or eliminated \nthe balances on several of these accounts. (Tr. 21-22, 48; AE B) \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$1,344. Applicant admitted this credit-card debt. He thought he used it \nto purchase a television and other consumer goods. There is a discrepancy among the \ncredit reports as to the last activity date. One stated that the last activity was in October \n2019, and two others stated it was September 2017. He testified that he has attempted \nto resolve this account by contacting the creditor, only to find out the account was sold to \nsome other creditor or collection service. He is still attempting to resolve this debt. (Tr. \n26-27; GE 3-4, 6, Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-$146,000 (Mortgage Foreclosure). Applicant admitted this debt as \ndescribed above concerning his rental property. His efforts to address this debt included \ntrying to secure tenants for this rental property, continuing to make the mortgage \npayments for several months while he was able to do so, and attempting to sell the \nproperty. The bank foreclosed before he could sell it. Applicant has never been contacted \nabout a deficiency after the foreclosure. (Tr. 28-29; GE 3-4, 6; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$19,145 (Second Mortgage Foreclosure). Applicant admitted this \ndebt as described above concerning his rental property. His efforts to address this debt \nincluded trying to secure tenants for this rental property, continuing to make the mortgage \npayments for several months while he was able to do so, and attempting to sell the \nproperty. The bank foreclosed before he could sell it. Applicant contacted the bank in \n2019 and was told there was nothing to be done with this debt because of the foreclosure. \nHis most recent credit report contained this entry regarding this debt: \u201cAccount Previously \nIn Dispute - Now Resolved By Data Furnisher, Collateral Released By Creditor/balance \nOwing.\u201d (Tr. 29-30; GE 3-4, 6; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d-(Current Mortgage Account). The Government failed to establish that \nthis debt was delinquent. (Tr. 30-31; GE 1-6; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e-(Credit Card). The Government failed to establish that this debt was \ndelinquent. (Tr. 31; GE 1-6; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.h-(Bank Loans). The Government failed to establish that these \ndebts were delinquent. (Tr. 33-36; GE 1-6; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i-$653. Applicant admitted this credit-card debt.

He testified that he has \nattempted to resolve this account by contacting the creditor, only to find out the account \nwas sold to some other creditor or collection service. He is still attempting to resolve this \ndebt and is awaiting a settlement offer from the current debt holder. (Tr. 38; GE 3-4, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k-$738. Applicant explained that this is an education debt for which he \nwas erroneously charged. He initially took a class, but he dropped the class within the \ntimeframe allowed. He was still charged for the class. He has disputed this debt. It no \nlonger appears on his two most recent credit reports. (Tr. 39; GE 4, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income, from all sources, is approximately $13,700, and his \nmonthly expenses are approximately $6,200, leaving a monthly remainder of $7,500 to \naddress his remaining debts. He testified that he put his life in harm\u2019s way for this country \nnumerous times and that he would never do anything to jeopardize the United States. (Tr. \n56-57; AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had delinquent debts that were unpaid or unresolved. Some of the \nalleged debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h, were not established as being delinquent, but for the \nremaining debts the above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.   \nApplicant faced circumstances beyond his control when his tenant vacated his \nrental property and he could no longer afford to pay the mortgage on that property, his \nresidential mortgage, and the separate household for his wife when they temporarily \nseparated in 2019. He acted responsibly by paying the mortgage for several months and \nsought a renter, before he could no longer afford to do so. He also attempted to sell the \nproperty, but the bank foreclosed before a sale could be accomplished. Both the first and \nsecond mortgage accounts on the rental property were resolved by the foreclosure and \nApplicant was never notified of any deficiencies. These difficulties led to him having to \nuse credit cards during that time. While he certainly should have pursued resolving his \ncredit-card debts in a timelier fashion, he was hindered by the subsequent sales of the \naccounts to secondary creditors. He is pursuing resolution of those accounts. His two \nrecent credit reports show his history of paying his debts and paying off or significantly \nreducing numerous large-balance accounts. There are clear indications that his debts are \nbeing resolved and that he is making good-faith efforts to do so. Applicant reasonably \ndisputed an educational debt. All the above mitigating conditions substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his nine years of service in foreign \ncountries, his seven deployments between 1990 and 2005, his decorations, and his \nfinancial difficulties related to his rental property. While Applicant could have been timelier \nin resolving of his debts, he is working toward resolving the unpaid credit cards. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both delinquent student loan accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) without further comment. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 45 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned an associate degree in 2001. He has been taking college courses towards earning an information technology (IT) certification since December 2022. He has worked in engineering for a defense contractor, with a security clearance, since March 2016. (Tr. 10, 16, 21, 35) The SOR alleges two federal student loans owed to the Department of Education (\u00b6 1.a, for $18,001 and \u00b6 1.b, for $11,864), totaling $29,865. Applicant admitted both debts in his Answer, and they are also established by his March 2022 credit report (GE 2). Applicant used these two student loans to finance his associate degree. The original amount of the loans totaled about $25,000-26,000. The loans were reported in collection status in early 2019. (GE 2; Tr. 23) He did not disclose any delinquent debts on his February 2021 SCA. (GE 1) Applicant attributed his delay in repaying the loans to periods of underemployment and unemployment in the years after he earned his degree.

On June 22, 2023, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for August 2, 2023, via video teleconference through an online \nplatform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, both of which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \nbut did not offer any exhibits. I held the post-hearing record open until September 5, 2023, \nto allow him the opportunity to do so. On August 29, 2023, Applicant submitted an e-mail \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A) and two documents. (AE B, AE C) They are all admitted \nwithout objection. He did not submit any further evidence. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 14, 2023, and the record closed on September 5, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both delinquent student loan accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) \nwithout further comment. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned \nan associate degree in 2001. He has been taking college courses towards earning an \ninformation technology (IT) certification since December 2022. He has worked in \nengineering for a defense contractor, with a security clearance, since March 2016. (Tr. \n10, 16, 21, 35) \nThe SOR alleges two federal student loans owed to the Department of Education \n(\u00b6 1.a, for $18,001 and \u00b6 1.b, for $11,864), totaling $29,865. Applicant admitted both debts \nin his Answer, and they are also established by his March 2022 credit report (GE 2). \nApplicant used these two student loans to finance his associate degree. The \noriginal amount of the loans totaled about $25,000-26,000. The loans were reported in \ncollection status in early 2019. (GE 2; Tr. 23) He did not disclose any delinquent debts on \nhis February 2021 SCA. (GE 1) \nApplicant attributed his delay in repaying the loans to periods of underemployment \nand unemployment in the years after he earned his degree. He was not able to find stable \nemployment until 2010. He worked for a medical company from 2010 to 2014. In 2014, \nhe relocated to his current home state. He worked in the real estate sector from 2014 until \n2016, when he joined the defense industry and secured his current employment. (GE 1; \nTr. 24-27) \nApplicant secured deferments of his loan payments twice. He said he has never \nbeen on a repayment plan for his student loans. He acknowledged that there were several \nyears where he took no action towards his loans. He admitted that he should have taken \ncare of them many years ago and is \u201cembarrassed about it\u201d now. (Tr. 28-29, 37) \nApplicant acknowledged that when he started with his employer in 2016, he was \ncontacted and asked to begin repayments on his student loans. He requested a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nforbearance, because \u201cevery time was kind of not the best time\u201d to begin repayments. (Tr. \n39-40) He maintained that he did not have sufficient funds to address his student loans\nuntil he was hired by his current employer. His starting annual salary with his current\nemployer was about $13,000 or 14,000. Since then, his salary has steadily increased,\nand he now earns an annual salary of $63,800. (Tr. 23-27) \n \n \n \nApplicant knew that delinquent debts were an issue for getting a clearance \nbecause of the potential for \u201ccompromise.\u201d His expenses have increased since he \nresumed taking classes in December 2022. He is financing his current courses \u201cout of \npocket\u201d and through a tuition reimbursement employee benefit. He anticipates that he will \npay about $14,000 to $16,000 \u201cout of pocket.\u201d The record did not indicate the amount he \nhas paid to date. (Tr. 29-30, 47-48) \nApplicant has not been contacted by the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) \nabout resuming his student loan payments after the post-COVID-19 forbearance program \nends this fall. (Tr. 29, 37-41) He knows that his past-due student loans are a \u201croadblock\u201d \nto furthering his education, but he has been concerned about beginning a payment plan \nand then falling behind. (Tr. 32-34, 45-47, 49-50) There is no indication in the record that \nhe ever contacted the USDOE to attempt even an income-based repayment plan. \nAt the hearing, Applicant detailed his plan to resolve the student loan debt. He \nintends to pay off his student loans in full by using the equity from his home. A few weeks \nbefore the hearing, he applied to refinance his mortgage. He believes he currently owes \njust under $30,000 in student loans. He plans to take the equity from the mortgage \nrefinancing and make one lump-sum payment to resolve the loan in full. He expects that \nhis monthly mortgage payment will increase from $900 to $1,300, which he said he has \nsufficient savings to address. However, the true impact on his monthly finances is unclear, \nsince it is too soon to tell without more information. (Tr. 29-34, 46-50) \nApplicant does not maintain a written budget, but he is current with all of his bills, \nand is able to detail his monthly expenses. He has no other delinquent debts. He has \nnever had a security violation. He would never do anything to compromise himself \nbecause he \u201cwouldn\u2019t say anything about what I do or how I do it.\u201d He has no past-due \ntaxes or tax returns. (Tr. 35-36, 42-44, 48-52) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided an update regarding his progress in resolving \nhis student loan debt. An August 4, 2023 Department of Education statement reflected \nhis total loan balance of $29,866 ($29,042 in principal and $823 in interest). (AE B) His \nmortgage refinance was conditionally approved at some point after the hearing, but final \nclosing was pending. (AE C) He indicated that he had reduced his 401(k) contributions. \nHe said he has been \u201cscared straight.\u201d (AE A) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline provides several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19. The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant federal student loans became delinquent in about 2019 before they were \nplaced in forbearance during the COVID-19 pandemic. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant incurred federal student loans to finance the associate degree that he \nearned in 2001. He had some employment instability for several years thereafter and \nbegan working for his current employer in 2016 at a low salary. These circumstances \nimpacted his ability and willingness to repay his student loans. He deferred payments \nseveral times but has never been on a repayment plan for his student loans, even one \nbased on his income. He did not initiate efforts to repay his loans until shortly before his \nhearing. His plan to resolve the loans by refinancing his mortgage is not unreasonable. \nHowever, since his loans have been in existence for more than 20 years, his current plan, \neven if put into effect, comes too late to show responsible action. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans remain unresolved and unaddressed. The COVID-19 \nforbearance program does not excuse his earlier years of inaction. ISCR Case No. 20-\n01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021); ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, \n2021). It is not required that Applicant pay all of his student loan debts at once, or in any \nparticular way. What is needed is a reasonable plan, and steps taken towards putting that \nplan into effect, such as with a track record of steady payments towards the debt. \nApplicant has not done this. None of the above mitigating conditions apply to mitigate the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concerns shown by Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans and his failure to \naddress them responsibly.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to address his \ndelinquent student loans on the eve of his hearing is not enough to show good faith, \nparticularly when balanced against many years of inaction. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial security concerns. This is not to say he cannot apply for \na clearance again in the future when he has a track record of financial responsibility \ntowards his debts. But at this time, he has not met his burden of mitigating the security \nconcern shown by his past-due student loans. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The DoD acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 19, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 3, 2023. The \nhearing was held as scheduled on May 9, 2023. At the close of the hearing, in response \nto Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument, I queried if there would be an objection to a \nsummary disposition. Department Counsel did not object. On June 16, 2023, I formally \nproposed to the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Neither party objected. \nApplicant's financial problems were caused by series of serious health events \nstarting in 2018, cumulating in her major emergency surgery in October 2022, which \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nkept her from work until February 2023 with limited disability compensation, as well as a \ncar accident and unemployment. She managed to maintain several debts that were not \nalleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR) and worked with her creditors. There is no \nevidence of negligence on her part, or any evidence of unwillingness to pay. She simply \ndid not have the finances to do so at this point. Prior to her emergency surgery she had \nretained a lawyer to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She has paid what she can when \nemployed and established a plan to resolve her financial problems. Based on the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude that the security concerns are mitigated under the \nfollowing mitigating conditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d). \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also \ngave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that she \nmet her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.

I have incorporated his \nadmissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He earned some college credits but not a degree. He \nwas married from 2005 to 2007. He remarried in 2016 and was divorced in 2020. He \nhas two children from his second marriage, ages 11 and 6. He has been employed by \nfederal contractors since approximately 2011 and by his present employer since 2019. \nHe is responsible for providing maintenance on the hardware of both classified and \nunclassified government computers. He stated he does not have access to classified \nsites but is responsible for the cables and fiber optics to them. (Tr. 16-22, 104-108; GE \n1) \nApplicant and his second wife separated sometime around May 2019. He stated \nthat he believed at that time they were still working on saving their marriage. In October \n2019, he learned that she obtained a default judgment for divorce from him. The \njudgment was later vacated, and they proceeded to divorce and were awarded equal \ncustody of the children. After the divorce was final, he learned from one of his children \nthat his ex-wife had been having an affair with his cousin while they were still married. \nApplicant sent her inappropriate text messages. He admitted he lost his temper. Based \non the text messages, his ex-wife sought protection from the court. (Tr. 22-29; GE 2, 3) \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant\u2019s attorney advised him that it would be beneficial if \nhe started an anger management class. When he enrolled, it was recommended that he \nalso take a class on domestic abuse, which included the anger management class. The \nclass lasted 24 weeks. When he went to court, the judge ruled the text messages were \nharassing and threatening, which resulted in an ex parte order of protection issued \nagainst Applicant in July 2020.

He was ordered to continue taking the anger management classes. (Tr.27-38, 84-\n86; AE A; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant testified that he has severe back pain and in 2013, his doctor \nprescribed oxycodone for the pain. He did not feel good on the pain medication. In \n2015, due to his own concern about the addictive nature of the drug, he told his doctor \nhe wanted to pursue different pain management. He was weened off oxycodone. His \ndoctor suggested he use Cannabidiol (CBD). He was told it was natural and not a \nnarcotic. It relieved his pain and allowed him to function normally. Applicant stated he \ncould purchase the CBD legally in his state. He used it as a muscle relaxer for his pain \nand back condition. He believed he could use CBD because it is legal in his state. He \ndid not know of any federal law implications. He purchased and used it regularly from \nMay 2015 to May 2021. (Tr. 39-52, 91-100) \nThe Security Executive Agent for the United States Government provided \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance \naddressed CBD products: \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that \nusing these cannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in \naccordance with SEAD 4. Although the passage of the Agricultural \nImprovement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from the definition of marijuana \nwithin the Controlled Substances Act, products containing greater than a \n0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d \nAccordingly, products labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than \n0.3 percent THC continue to meet the legal definition of marijuana, and \ntherefore remain illegal to use under federal law and policy. Additionally, \nagencies should be aware that the Federal Drug Administration does not \ncertify levels of THC in CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot \nbe guaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD \nproduct under federal law. Studies have shown that some CBD products \nexceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold for hemp, notwithstanding \nadvertising labels (Reference F). Therefore, there is a risk that using these \nproducts may nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in \na positive marijuana test under agency-administered employment or \nrandom drug testing programs. Should an individual test positive, they will \nbe subject to an investigation under specific guidelines established by \ntheir home agency.  \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) \nprovided a warning about CBD products on July 24, 2019: \nStudies have shown that some CBD products\u2019 labeling does not \naccurately reflect their content. Cannabis based products containing a \nTHC level greater than 0.3% on a dry weight basis do not fall under the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFarm Bill\u2019s definition of hemp even if they are labeled as such. In one \nstudy, the amount of CBD in 69% of the 84 tested CBD products was \ninconsistent with that on the label, and some products contained \nunlabeled cannabinoids, including THC in amounts up to 6.4 mg/ml. As \nsuch, an employee\u2019s drug test may be positive for the THC metabolite, \ndelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), due to THC in the \nCBD product.  \nSAMSHA further advised that \u201cfederal agencies should make every effort to \ninform applicants and employees of the risk that using such products may result in a \npositive marijuana test.\u201d \nApplicant passed a number of drug tests and provided the results. He testified \nthat he asked his supervisor if he was permitted to use CBD and was told it was not \nillegal. (Tr. 47-48; AE B) \nIn May 2021, Applicant went back to court to have his visitation with his children \nreinstated. The court determined that if both parties wanted to see their children, they \nwere required to take a drug test. Applicant testified that earlier that month, he was \nattending a bachelor party in a state where marijuana is legal. He testified he used \nmarijuana at the party and was aware that although it was legal in the state where he \nwas located, it was illegal under federal law. He held a security clearance at the time. \nHe said it had been a stressful year due to the court proceedings, and he decided \u201cwell \nI\u2019ll just have fun one night.\u201d (Tr. 39, 53-55, 91-92) \nWhile in court, the judge asked Applicant if any drug would be detected during \nthe drug screening. Applicant told the Court about his marijuana use earlier that month \nand that he is prescribed Adderall. The judge told both parties before the drug test that if \nthey did not testify honestly, they would be subject to contempt and a ten-day jail \nsentence. Applicant\u2019s drug screen tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. \nApplicant adamantly denied he knowingly used methamphetamine. He said he had no \nidea how he tested positive for methamphetamine, but he had several theories. He said \nthe judge believed he had lied to him. Applicant concurred that he would have believed \nthe same if he saw a positive drug result. Applicant testified that the judge told him that \nhe needed to go to drug rehabilitation and assess his life, and he told him how to live. \nApplicant acknowledged he had a negative attitude, and he was upset. He told the \njudge \u201cYou need to worry about you. I got me.\u201d Applicant testified that he was held in \ncontempt of court because the judge believed he was dishonest about his drug use after \nhe tested positive for two illegal drugs. He served a 10-day sentence for contempt. (Tr. \n55-63, 86-88; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that part of his visitation order is that if he wanted to see his \nchildren, he had to provide a drug screen. Applicant did not have to do a drug screen if \nhe did not plan to see his children. Applicant provided negative drug screen results \ntaken from hair follicles. This type of test is able to detect a longer period if drugs are in \nthe system.

He \nsaid he did not realize she was on the group text. She believed it was a violation of the \nno contact ex parte order. Court documents from November 2021 state that Applicant \nadmitted he was held in civil contempt for violating a no contact order. He denied his \ntext had any derogatory message. (Tr. 65-75, 88-91; GE 2 page 13) \nApplicant testified that he continued to participate in counseling even after the \n24-week class ended. He said he did not know he had anger issues until he went \nthrough counseling. He still meets with a counselor, and they have lunch together. He \nalso attends classes occasionally. The counselor provided a report that Applicant had \nsuccessfully completed the required session. He made a $2,500 donation to his \ncounselor\u2019s facility. (Tr. 84-86; AE A) \nApplicant testified that he was going through a difficult time in his life when he \nwas dealing with an acrimonious divorce, and he was unable to see his children. He \nattributed his marijuana use to stress in his life. He loves and is devoted to his job. He \nadmitted he made a mistake. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing statement mentioned his family\u2019s \nservice in the military and federal government. He stated he is not a threat or liability. \nHe stated: \u201cI refused to snitch when I tested positive for drugs and was charged with \ncontempt.\u201d He further stated that he does not sell out his friends, family, or country. He \nbelieves he has been an asset to the military community. (Tr. 78; AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s candid testimony about his CBD use. Although he \nknowingly used CBD, he did not believe he was using marijuana. There is no evidence \nhe was using it for anything other than for medicinal purposes. Based on the information \nabout the possibility that CBDs may have levels of THC that are in excess of what is on \ntheir labels, I do not believe he intentionally or knowingly attempted to use THC. There \nis no evidence that the CBDs he used contained THC. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant knowingly and \nintentionally used marijuana in May 2021 based on his admission and a positive drug \ntest. Applicant failed a court-ordered drug screen testing positive for both marijuana and \nmethamphetamine. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s job is classified as a \nsensitive position. There is evidence he held a security clearance when he used \nmarijuana and methamphetamine, but not while he was granted access to classified \ninformation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) apply. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nunder the drug involvement guideline. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant knowingly and intentionally used marijuana because he thought he \nwould have fun. This does not reflect a mature attitude about illegal drug use, especially \nwhen holding a security clearance. He denies he used methamphetamine, but his court-\nordered drug test reflects a positive result. His use of the drugs was while he was \nattempting to gain visitation of his children. I have considered his negative drug tests \nthat are required if he wants to see his children. Although he is remorseful for his \nconduct, I am unable to find that his conduct does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Applicant may be \ncommitted to not using illegal drugs again in the future, but it is too soon to negate his \nknowing and intentional past drug use. Despite some mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b), it is \ninsufficient to mitigate his conduct. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonest or rule \nviolations . . . ; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was deemed by the Court to have sent harassing and/or threatening \ntext messages to his former spouse, resulting in an ex parte order of protection issued \nagainst him in July 2020. Applicant was held in contempt of court in May 2021 for being \ndishonest to the court and was sentenced to 10 days in jail, which he served. His court \ndocuments reflect that in November 2021 he admitted to being in civil contempt for \nviolating a no contact order. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the above disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation. Mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying security concerns based on \nthe facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant has participated in domestic violence counseling and anger \nmanagement, which are positive steps. However, honesty is a cornerstone of the \nsecurity clearance process. Failing to follow an ex parte order of protection raises \nquestions about his ability and commitment to following rules and regulations. To be \ndishonest and somewhat glib to a judge also raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s respect \nfor the law and authority. There is no doubt Applicant was involved in an acrimonious \ndivorce and custody issues. However, violating a court order and going to jail for \ncontempt were not minor and were not infrequent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) have some \napplication, but they are insufficient to overcome the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline H, drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G.

She attributes them primarily to low wages, lack of money management skills, and difficulty affording to raise children without adequate child support. (GE 2 at 3) Her financial problems were later exacerbated by her troubled marriage, as her ex-husband often opened charge accounts in her name without her knowledge. Moreover, after their separation, Applicant\u2019s husband failed to abide by the separation agreement to pay some of the bills.

(GE 2 at 2) Since June 2022, she has been working for a \ndefense contractor as a facility security officer. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She attributes them primarily to low \nwages, lack of money management skills, and difficulty affording to raise children without \nadequate child support. (GE 2 at 3) Her financial problems were later exacerbated by her \ntroubled marriage, as her ex-husband often opened charge accounts in her name without \nher knowledge. Moreover, after their separation, Applicant\u2019s husband failed to abide by the \nseparation agreement to pay some of the bills. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. 15) Applicant\u2019s difficulties \npaying for medical care also strained her finances. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt, as alleged in the SOR, totals approximately $45,000, \nApproximately $26,000 of this debt is composed of medical bills, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m - 1.o, and 1.t through 1.v. (Tr. 46) Applicant incurred \nthese bills before she began working at her current job. At that time, she received Medicaid \nhealth benefits. She was unaware that Medicaid did not cover her bills in their entirety. (GE \n2 at 5; Tr. 35) Some of these medical bills are nearly 25 years old. (Answer at 1) She \nintends to call these treatment providers and apply for a medical debt relief program to help \nher satisfy the debts. (Answer) She has not yet begun paying any of these debts and she \nprovided no evidence that she has applied for a medical debt relief program. \nApproximately $14,500 of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt constitutes federal \ngovernment student loans, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.f,, 1.i and 1.p. \nThey were in COVID-related forbearance through August 2022 . (Tr. 32) Applicant has not \nmade any payments since the forbearance ended. (Tr. 33) She was supposed to pay the \ncreditors $5 per month, the amount she was paying before the pandemic. (Tr. 33) \nApproximately $2,500 of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt constitute private student loan \naccounts, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q. Currently, they are in \nforbearance, and will remain so until October 2023. (AE A) \nThe remaining miscellaneous debts, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.g, 1.k, 1.r, 1.s, \nand 1.w through 1.aa, total approximately $5,100. Applicant confirmed that the debt alleged \nin subparagraph 1.r, as duplicated in subparagraph 1.z, totaling $468, is now in current \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstatus. (AE B) She satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.y, totaling $1,008, in 2020. \n(AE C) The others remain outstanding. \nIn approximately 2018, Applicant retained a debt resolution company to help her with \nher financial problems. (Tr. 27) She contends that they disputed all of her delinquent debts \non her behalf, and helped her resolve debts that were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 28) She \ndid not provide a copy of any retainer agreement or any evidence of the work they \naccomplished. (Tr. 27-28) \nIn July 2023, Applicant consulted a credit repair company. It is researching her \ncredit, identifying bills, and advising her on which bills that she should dispute. (AE D) \nApplicant earns $72,000 per year. (Tr. 22) She has nominal monthly income and \nlives \u201cpaycheck to paycheck.\u201d (Tr. 25) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) The student loan accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q are back in \nforbearance. Applicant caught up on payments to the creditor alleged in subparagraph 1.r, \nas duplicated in subparagraph 1.z. She satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.y, \nthree years ago in 2020. I resolve these allegations in her favor. As for the remainder, her \nhistory of financial problems, and continuing inability to resolve the majority of her debt \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems originally stemmed from difficulty making ends meet \nas a single mother, and they were exacerbated years later after the man whom she married \nbegan abusing her credit towards the end of their marriage. Conversely, she has not taken \nany appreciable steps to resolve her medical bills, despite the fact that some are more than \n25 years old, and she did not outline a plan for satisfying the federal student loan debts \nnow that they are out of forbearance. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(b) is only \npartially applicable. \nAlthough Applicant worked with a debt resolution company several years ago, she \nprovided no evidence of the work that it accomplished. Although Applicant recently retained \na credit repair agency, she did so more than a year after the issuance of the SOR, and one \nmonth after the hearing. Moreover, she has not provided a plan for paying the delinquent \nstudent loans, nor has she presented evidence that she has applied for assistance to pay \nher medical debts, as she testified that she was going to do. Under these circumstances, I \ncannot conclude that either AG \u00b6 20(c), or AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. In sum, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by reckless or irresponsible \nspending. Instead, they were caused by lack of income needed to make ends meet without \nusing credit cards, and they were exacerbated by a divorce. Nevertheless, Applicant still \nhas the burden of demonstrating steps she has taken to alleviate these problems. Although \nApplicant presented some evidence, it was insufficient to provide a clear picture that she \nhas gotten her troubled finances under control. Under these circumstances, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p \u2013 1.r: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.s \u2013 1.x:: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.y \u2013 1.z: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.aa: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an inspector. He has worked for his current employer since 2017. He seeks to reestablish his security clearance. He earned his high school diploma in 2017 and has completed some apprentice courses but has not obtained a degree.

(GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21; Tr. \n17-18.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the three Guideline H allegations. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, that he purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nJanuary 2012 through January 2019. SOR \u00b6 1.b, that he purchased and used marijuana \nas set forth in subparagraph 1.a after being granted access to classified information in \n2018. SOR \u00b6 1.c, that in January 2019 he was arrested and charged with (1) sell, give, or \ndistribute more than one-half ounce, but less than five pounds of marijuana, a felony, and \n(2) carrying concealed weapon.

He stopped smoking marijuana \nfrom March 2017 to about February 2018, which was around the time he was hired by his \nemployer, but he could not recall why he stopped. (Tr. at 20.) In his security clearance \ninterview he told the investigator he stopped to prepare for attending college and \napprentice school where he knew he would be required to pass a drug screening. (GE 3 \nat 6.) After February 2018 he described his usage as \u201cmore of a weekly basis\u2026not every \nday.\u201d (Tr. at 20.) He estimated he would probably purchase about an ounce of marijuana \na week. (Tr. at 20-21.) When he resumed smoking marijuana in February 2018 he held a \nclearance; had been granted to classified information, and he acknowledged in his \ntestimony it was not allowed. (Tr. at 21-22; GE 1 at 27.) He explained his duties generally \nand generally what his security clearance had allowed him access to inspect until it was \nsuspended. (Tr. at 22.) \nIn January 2019, Applicant was pulled over and the officer smelled marijuana in \nthe vehicle. A search of the vehicle found about seven ounces of marijuana in a glass \ncistern, which he purchased for about $1,000. (Tr. at 24, 25-26; GE 5.) He denied any \nintentions to sell the marijuana. (Tr. at 26.) He told the investigator he would purchase \nenough to avoid the long drive. (GE 3 at 5.) The felony charge was reduced to a \nmisdemeanor as part of a plea agreement. He served the unsuspended portion of his \nsentence on weekends, paid a fine, and served probation for three years. (Tr. at 24.) The \ncarrying a concealed weapon charge was dismissed. He claimed that he was legally \ncarrying the weapon. He testified; \u201ctrying to do my due diligence in reading it upon the law \non how to carry my weapon.

(GE 3 at 7.) \nApplicant stated he stopped using marijuana after January 2019 because the \narrest was \u201clike a reality check, you know, how fast things can go wrong.\u201d (Tr. at 28.) He \nexplained to the investigator that he has his children to live for now and cannot risk being \nfired because of illegal drugs. He does not want his children around illegal drugs. (GE 3 \nat 7.) He has not attended any substance abuse courses. He no longer associates with \npeople who use marijuana. He has never failed an employer drug test. (Tr. at 29.) There \nare no further terms on his conviction. (Tr. at 39.) He stated in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories he had no intention of further use of marijuana. (GE 3 at 13.) \nApplicant in his Answer denied SOR \u00b6 2.a. Department Counsel queried Applicant \nabout the denial and pointed out this was a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6 1.c. In response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s question, Applicant responded he is not disputing the Guideline J \nallegation.

(Answer and Tr. at 30-31.) He acknowledged the lie in his testimony, \n\u201cWhen I filled out the one in 2017, I did lie knowingly about my marijuana usage. I was \n18, freshly coming out of high school, and really didn\u2019t know what I was getting into when \nI done that one.\u201d (Tr. at 16.) His reason for not revealing his marijuana use at the time; \u201cI \nthought it would affect my employment.\u201d (Tr. at 31.) \nApplicant very credibly described the difference between the man he was in 2019 \nand the man he has become. Four years ago, he would come home, smoke marijuana, \nand go to sleep. He would get off work, smoke and sleep until about 1800, 1900, 2000, \nthen get up and eat, maybe smoke again, and just do nothing, lay around the house all \nday. (Tr. at 38.) He is now a father of three, his oldest child was born in August 2020. He \nnormally works during the week from 0500 to 1300. When he gets home, he takes care \nof the yard and works on his truck because the children are napping until 1600. When \nthey wake up he is with the children making them a snack and taking them to an activity \nlike a jump park, painting, or playing in the sprinkler and after that it would be dinnertime. \nAfter dinner there is some more playtime and then it is time to \u201cchange diapers, [and] get \nready to go to bed.\u201d (Tr. at 38.) Typically, the weekend is spent just trying to keep the \nchildren busy and \u201cnot making a mess inside the house.\u201d (Tr. at 36) He offered as \nexamples attending group children\u2019s readings at a local bookstore or going to the beach. \nHis hobby is working in the driveway on his two vehicles. Aside from a \u201ccold beer on a hot \nday\u201d otherwise he does not drink. (Tr. at 37-38.) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat  cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted he used marijuana after being granted access to \nclassified information and purchased marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \napplicable. 25(f) is not applicable. The SOR did not allege use while granted \naccess to classified information, it alleged use \u201cafter being granted access to \nclassified information in or around 2018.\u201d I find SOR 1.b for Applicant as a duplicate \nallegation to SOR 1.a. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant knew throughout the periods of time \nalleged that his use and purchases of marijuana were prohibited under Federal law. He \ncontinued to purchase and use marijuana after applying for a security clearance and after \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing placed on notice that such conduct after being granted access to classified \ninformation was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. In doing so, Applicant not \nonly knowingly violated Federal drug laws but also disregarded security clearance \neligibility standards. This behavior raises substantial questions about Applicant's \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See \nISCR Case No. 20-02974 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). Applicant's statement in the \ninterrogatories of his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future does not mitigate the \nscope of these security concerns. Nor does the passage of a little over a year since he \ncompleted probation eliminate those concerns for an applicant who knowingly violated \nFederal drug laws and continued to use marijuana for at least 12 months after being \ngranted a security clearance. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record, the above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply. While Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline H \nconcerns involving his drug use after being granted access to classified information he \nhas substantially changed his life from when the criminal behavior happened. He has \nmatured into a responsible father such that it is unlikely he will involve himself again in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncriminal behavior.

He has expressed remorse and has credibly established \nin his testimony and statements during his security clearance interview that his focus is \nnow on his family. He has demonstrated he is successfully rehabilitated and accepts \nresponsibility for his actions. The criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, \nwhile legal there, is illegal in the United States. \nSOR 3.a cross-alleges the conduct set forth in SOR 1.a-1.c, which Applicant \nadmitted and included marijuana use after being granted access to classified information. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable to SOR 3.a. \nSOR 3.b-3.d allege Applicant deliberately failed to disclose certain behavior on his \nSF-86.

AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR 3.d. \nFor SOR 3.b-3.c, Applicant testified he believed SOR 3.b was a clerical error and \nfor SOR 3.c his disclosure in one section covered the issue and that he thought he had \ncovered the concerns. \u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when \nhe executed his Security Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were \nnot binding on the Administrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. \n29, 2006) (citation omitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the \nAppeal Board recognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in \nfalsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) not applicable to SOR 3.c. Applicant thought he had covered the drug \nuse concerns with his disclosure in one section would cover the issue and as a result he \nthought he had covered the concerns. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR 3.b. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a) is established for SOR 3.b. I am satisfied that \nApplicant did not deliberately fail to disclose the information described in SOR 3.b. He \nreported his 2019 arrest for drug misconduct in his 2021 e-QIP and he discussed his drug \nuse with the investigator during his security clearance interview. \nThe mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) is established for SOR 3.d. Applicant candidly \ntestified that his 2017 omission was intentional. Given his age and experience and how \nmuch time has passed, as well as the evidence he has now focused his life on his family \nand work, he has mitigated the security concerns for SOR 3.d. \nApplicant used marijuana after being granted access to classified information, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich had been obtained after intentionally failing to disclose his drug use history. \nPersonal conduct security concerns for SOR 3.a are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H, Guideline J, \nand Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. However, he has mitigated \nGuideline J security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Now \nthat she is recovered, she will return to work. They plan to use funds from his wife\u2019s \nsettlement to resolve or settle several of their delinquent debts. (Item 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and his admissions establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies to loss of income, expenses due to \nhis son with special needs, injury of his spouse and underemployment. Notwithstanding \nthe events that affected his finances, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. In February 2022, he admitted in an interrogatory \nthat he had not paid or arranged a payment plan with any of his delinquent creditors. At \nthat same time, he submitted a PFS that showed he had just over $1,000 monthly net \nremainder after paying his monthly expenses, which did not include payments to any of \nhis delinquent creditors. His PFS showed that he had not adopted or devised a workable, \nrealistic strategy for addressing his delinquent debts. Applicant stated that it was his \nintention to use funds from his wife\u2019s settlement to pay or settle his delinquent creditors \nin the future. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate the financial concerns in \nthis case. He did not provide any receipts or correspondence from the creditors to validate \nhis claim that he had paid five delinquent accounts. He submitted an April 2022 credit \nreport that showed five of the SOR accounts had dropped off the report. More importantly, \nthere remains 14 outstanding accounts that are largely unaddressed. He submitted an \nundated letter from a credit-repair organization, which acknowledged they had been hired, \nbut there is nothing in the record that shows he successfully disputed, settled, paid, or \ninitiated payments on any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.

Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccess to classified and protected information requires faithful adherence to the \nrules and regulations governing such activity. A person who fails to address concerns, \neven after having been placed on notice that his or her access or security clearance is in \njeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are at stake. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy career in the Marine Corps and his employment with a government contractor \nand the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and \npersuasion. In the event he may wish to alleviate his financial security concerns and revisit \nhis security clearance eligibility in the future, he should consider financial counseling, a \nworkable household budget, and a pattern of attentiveness to his financial obligations. At \nthe present time, Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns \nor establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He attended \ncommunity college for about three months in the fall of 2013. He married in April 2018 \nand has one child, a daughter age four. He purchased a home in November 2019.

(Item 1.) \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. (Item 2.) \nIn his July 7, 2021 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant described his \nmarijuana use from November 2010 to October 2020. His use was experimental and to \nbe sociable. He used with a friend, AA, at another friend\u2019s house. The drug was obtained \nby AA. He only bought marijuana once, and that was from AA. AA still used drugs but \nApplicant did not know which drugs or in what amounts. The marijuana made him feel \nrelaxed but had no impact on his personality, judgment, reliability, work, or friends. He \nhad no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. He was not dependent on marijuana. (Item \n4.) \nApplicant described his LSD use from March 2015 to May 2017. He used LSD as \nan experiment after seeing a movie. He used it twice, with his friend, AA, who obtained it. \nIt made him feel anxious and uncomfortable.

(Item 4.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 24, 2022 response to a DOHA Interrogatory asking the last time \nhe used marijuana, he said: \u201cI genuinely can\u2019t remember the last time I used marijuana \nor a THC product. It\u2019s been about 2 years now. 10/2020 would be a rough guess as to \nthe last time.\u201d (Item 4.) In his Response, he stated that \u201cit\u2019s been almost 3 years since I \nused any THC/Marijuana product.\u201d (Item 4.) In his Response to the FORM, he stated his \nregret for his past use of marijuana and also emphasized that he is now a husband, a \nfather, and the primary provider for his family. \nDiscussion \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline (AG) H, suitability of an applicant may be questioned \nor put into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about \na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, \nand 26 set forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant admitted to purchasing marijuana (once, from AA) and using marijuana \nfrom November 2010 to October 2020. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to an \nSOR require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 4, 1995) AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated \nby the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml. \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nI have also considered the following mitigating conditions under AG H: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2)  changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used: and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all future drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 25(a), Applicant\u2019s marijuana use started in November 2010, which is \nquite long ago. It continued, however until October 2020. So it did recur during that 10-\nyear period and ended quite recently. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug usage is not\nmitigated by AG \u00b6 25(a). \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nThe key under mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(b) is the \u201cpattern of abstinence.\u201d Subparts \n(1) through (3) are simply nonexclusive examples of how such a pattern may be shown. \nIt seems that certain changes in Applicant\u2019s life have operated to disassociate him from \nhis former drug-using friends. In particular, he and AA now live in different, not adjacent, \nstates and see each other only several times a year. Similarly, he is now a homeowner, \nmarried, and the father of a four-year old child. So, the former drug-using environment is \nno more. These are all salutary changes.  \nHere, the \u201cpattern of abstinence\u201d must be weighed against a lengthy period of \nmarijuana use. Applicant began his marijuana use in high school in 2020, not a particularly \nunusual time or place for that to happen. He did, however, continue that recreational use \nuntil about October 2020, by his own estimate. He claimed he is not dependent on \nmarijuana and has no intent to use it in the future. There is nothing in the record that \ncontradicts his representations. But his 10 years of prior marijuana use outweigh his \nrecent few years of abstinence. This is not to minimize his current track record of \nabstinence; it is commendable. If he continues on his present path, he could be a worthy \ncandidate for reapplication. At this point, however, it is not sufficient to mitigate his \nextended history of marijuana use. I must find against him on SOR \u00b6 1. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s one-time use of cocaine and his twice-use of LSD do not \nraise national security concerns. \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through (9) and 2(f)(1) through (6). Accordingly, I conclude that \nApplicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

Applicant responded to the SOR on September 7, 2022, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

(AE F-H) The \npertinent facts are summarized in the written requests and fact sheets and will not be \nrepeated verbatim here. Of note is that China is an authoritarian state dominated by the \nChinese Communist Party, with a poor record with respect to human rights. Taiwan is a \ndemocracy. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. \nHowever, the United States does not support Taiwan\u2019s independence from China. \nThe United States faces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese \nintelligence operations. China aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected \ninformation, and Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic \nespionage. Taiwan is also targeted by China. Taiwanese interests have also been \nactive collectors of U.S. economic technologies that have sensitive military applications. \nNumerous cases have arisen involving the illegal export or attempted export of \nsensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1994 \nuntil he was honorably discharged after medical issues in 1997.

(Tr. at 40; AE E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of the United States and Taiwan. His in-laws are \ncitizens and residents of Taiwan. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust \nunofficial relationship. However, the United States does not support Taiwan\u2019s \nindependence from China. China aggressively targets U.S. and Taiwanese sensitive \nand protected information. Taiwan has been an active collector of U.S. economic \ntechnologies that have sensitive military applications. Numerous cases have arisen \ninvolving the illegal export or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to \nTaiwan. Applicant\u2019s Taiwanese family members create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion both individually and through his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. He is from a military family, and he served \nhonorably in the U.S. military. His wife came to the United States in 2005; they married \nin 2006; she became a U.S. citizen in 2012; and their three children were born in the \nUnited States. His wife maintains contact with her mother, but her contact with her \nsiblings is much less frequent. Her mother is financially independent. Applicant has very \nlittle contact with any of his in-laws because of the language barrier. He credibly testified \nthat his wife\u2019s family in Taiwan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into \nrevealing classified information. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan are outweighed by his deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the \ninterests of Taiwan. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to $9,000 in auto repairs in 2014 and \nhis failed attempt at flipping houses. Those events were beyond his control, but he also \ntraveled to a foreign country for tourism in 2018 for between 11 and 20 days. \nApplicant is credited with paying $180 and $2,345 to resolve the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The $364 charged-off debt to a credit union (SOR \u00b6 1.k) was \nresolved before July 2019. I accept his testimony that he would have paid the $90 and \n$287 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.j, but the creditors could not locate the debts. \nThose five debts are mitigated. \nThe six remaining debts total about $28,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e-1.i) and are all \nreported on both the November 2019 and April 2022 credit reports. Applicant admitted \nin his SOR response and at the hearing that he owed those debts. Post-hearing, he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nstated, without explanation or documentation, that he only had two debts left to pay off. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to \npresent documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-\n07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 1, 2006)).  \nI infer that Applicant meant that the four debts were no longer on his credit \nreport. The fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any \nmeaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. See, e.g., ADP \nCase No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015) and ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). Additionally, I cannot conclude with any degree of certainty \nthat the debts are not on his credit report, because I only received a partial credit report. \nHe stated that he plans to pay his debts. Intentions to resolve financial problems in the \nfuture are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to eliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

During this period, \nhis tenants left, and Applicant was no longer receiving rental income. He and his wife \nbegan using credit cards and the balances became unmanageable. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nFrom 2017 to 2019, Applicant began accumulating debt, and in 2018 he began \nmissing payments. In 2019, he was proactive about resolving his debts. He established \npayment plans, a budget, and participated in financial counseling. (Items 7, 8, 9) \nApplicant also attributed his financial problems to the COVID-19 pandemic. He \nwas hospitalized with the virus. His in-laws lived with their family from 2010 until 2022. \nHis father-in-law also contracted the virus and was hospitalized in 2020. He passed away \nin the hospital in 2021. His daughter was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her medical \ntreatment was several hours away. It took numerous medical and hospital visits before \nshe was properly diagnosed in 2020. In addition, his wife was laid off from her job. \nApplicant was also diagnosed with blood cancer upon his return from his military service \nin Iraq. His medical condition is debilitating and impacts his daily life. (Item 3, AE 1, 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent credit card or consumer accounts totaling \napproximately $87,832. It also alleges a foreclosed mortgage on a timeshare with a \nremaining balance of $56,375.

In January 2022, Applicant responded to \ngovernment interrogatories, and he disclosed that that he owed income taxes for tax year \n2018. In his answer to the SOR, he disputed that he owed a tax debt. He provided a copy \nof his 2018 tax transcripts, which shows a zero-balance owed. A refund from tax year \n2018 was applied to a 2017 tax debt, and he received the balance of the refund. He also \nprovided copies of his 2019 and 2020 tax transcripts that shows he owes 15 cents and \n$1.82, respectively. It is noted that according to the transcripts, he failed to timely file his \ntax returns for both years. He filed his 2019 and his 2020 income tax returns in August \n2022, after receiving the SOR. His failure to timely file his income tax returns was not \nalleged in the SOR.

He began making \npayments to GH in August 2019. In December 2019, he enrolled in another credit \nassistance program (CAN), which provided him additional financial counseling and \nassistance in paying off his debts.

He admits he did not understand the timeshare \nprocess when he purchased it or how his costs continued to increase. There is a process \nwhere a timeshare may be \u201ctraded-in\u201d for another. In 2010, Applicant \u201ctraded in\u201d his \ntimeshare for another and in 2011 he again \u201ctraded-in\u201d the timeshare. He did this again \nin 2015 and 2017. Apparently, the \u201ctrade-in\u201d process is used to leverage use of other HIC \nvacation properties across the country and is also another way to increase owner costs. \nEach time one wants to use a property in another location, they would have to trade in \nthrough the exchange process which increased the costs, which was never mentioned by \nHIC. (Response to FORM) \nHIC refused to engage in any dialogue with Applicant regarding his property. HIC \ncancelled and charged off the timeshare in September 2018 and foreclosed in February \n2020. Applicant was never notified the property was foreclosed until May 2023, which is \nwhy he denied the property was foreclosed in his SOR answer. It took more than a year \nof multiple phone calls and emails to HIC before it acknowledged the foreclosure. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney engaged HIC and it could not produce evidence that Applicant had \nbeen notified of the foreclosure. Applicant had attempted to surrender the property over \nseveral years and HIC never mentioned to him the account was closed and the property \nforeclosed. HIC is the subject of multiple complaints through the Better Business Bureau \nrelated to predatory practices. (Item 4; AE 10, 11) \nApplicant recently participated in another financial counseling course. He provided \nnumerous letters reflecting his outstanding character and ability to protect classified \ninformation, and asserting he is not a threat to national security. He is described as \ndiligent, honest, reliable, and loyal. He is a person who exercises good judgment and \nintegrity. He is devoted to his church and volunteers his time and talents to the community. \nHe is a trusted employee with the highest personal and professional standards.  (Item 2-\nenclosure 3, 4,5, 6, 10; AE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent credit cards, accounts, and a timeshare \nproperty. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a period when he was required to \nmove his residence to remain employed. He maintained two households during this \nperiod. His salary was reduced. He had rental property and the tenants moved, thereby \nreducing his income. He overextended himself by using credit cards, which eventually \nbecame unmanageable. In addition, he had a timeshare that clearly had predatory \nbusiness practices. His wife lost her job. Her parents lived with them. The pandemic also \nimpacted their family with his father-in-law passing away from the virus. These were \nconditions beyond his control. Applicant began addressing his delinquent debts before he \nreceived the SOR. He participated in two debt-resolution programs and financial \ncounseling. He has paid all of the debts alleged in the SOR, except the timeshare. \nRegarding the debt for the timeshare alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, I find their failure to discuss \nresolving the timeshare mortgage, failure to notify Applicant of its foreclosure, and their \nreputation regarding their business practices rises to the level of being predatory. I find in \nhis favor on this debt. \nBased on all of the evidence, I conclude the circumstances that caused Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The conditions that resulted in his financial problems \nwere beyond his control and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has \nparticipated in financial counseling and there are clear indications his financial problems \nare under control. He made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts and has done so. He \nprovided sufficient evidence to address the legitimacy of the timeshare debt, and I resolve \nit in his favor. All of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions considering all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Although I have found in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor on the debts alleged, I have some concerns about his failure to timely file his income \ntax returns for two years. I believe Applicant will be more diligent in the future and ensure \nthey are filed timely so as not to impact his clearance eligibility. He has met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant successfully mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

She was \nthreatening to \u201cstomp\u201d the wife of an ex-boyfriend of hers from 40 years before and teach \nthat person a lesson. During the course of the hospitalization she was diagnosed with \nSchizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. After two weeks she was able to be discharged \nin fair condition. (Government Exhibit 2 at 5-6, Exhibit 3; Tr. 30-31, 33-37.) \nThe intake notes stated the following: \nDuring the interview the patient [Applicant] was hyperverbal, quite \ndisorganized with labile mood, laughing inappropriately, continued to make \nthreatening remarks to others and at this point is too unpredictable and \nconfused to be safely managed at the lower level of care. (Government \nExhibit 3 at 1.) \nApplicant testified that she had little to no memory of the incidents that led to her \ninvoluntary hospitalization. She testified that before those incidents she had been feeling \nill and believes she threw up her medications. She also did not describe in detail the \ncourse of hospitalization. (Tr. 26-27, 33, 38-42.) \n1.b. Applicant received an evaluation from MHC in November 2021. The consultant \ninterviewed Applicant, conducted a screening test, and reviewed her mental health \nrecords. She diagnosed Applicant as suffering from a Schizoaffective Disorder. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nMHC\u2019s \nreport stated the following under the heading BEHAVIORAL \nOBSERVATIONS: \nUpon initiation of the interview, [Applicant] presented with an upbeat, \nchipper, and playful tone. Her demeanor was highly childlike, particularly \napparent through her use of language. Her affect was incongruent with what \nwould be expected given the circumstances for the assessment. She \nappeared disoriented and disconnected at various points throughout the \ninterview, and her thoughts were highly disorganized. Her thoughts were \noften difficult to follow, and many of her narratives required clarification. \nWhile [Applicant] expressed a history of engagement in therapy, self-\nreflection, and healing, she appears to present with limited insight \nsurrounding her mental health functioning. Though she spoke openly about \na trauma history, her awareness of her history of psychotic symptoms was \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nminimal. She has a history of impaired judgment, stemming from apparent \ndistortions in perception, information gathered through the clinical interview \nwas disorganized and periodically incoherent, contributing to difficulty \nestablishing a clear understanding of [Applicant\u2019s] mental health history. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 8.) \nMHC stated the following under the heading DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS AND \nPROGNOSIS: \nThe assessment sought to clarify [Applicant\u2019s] current level of emotional \nfunctioning, given her recent inpatient hospitalization in 2020. While \n[Applicant\u2019s] mental health appeared to decompensate in response to\nincreasing stressors surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the assessment\nrevealed longstanding patterns of instability in mood, distortion in \nperception, and interpersonal issues for [Applicant]. She is currently actively \nengaged in psychiatric care with a nurse practitioner, and [Applicant] is \ntaking her medications as prescribed in order to manage her mood and \npsychotic symptoms. It is noteworthy that she presents with incredibly \nlimited insight around her history of psychosis, which is common for\nindividuals with delusional ideation. At present, [Applicant] denied any \ncurrent symptoms to suggest an active mood episode, such as a \ndepressive, manic, or hypomanic state. As psychotic symptoms were \nevident in the absence of a mood episode, the current assessment supports\nher previous diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder. Though she does not\nappear to be at an acute risk for acting erratically or harming herself, she \ncontinues to present with disorganized thinking and distortions in perception\nthat warrant concern regarding her current functioning. Her prognosis is fair, \ngiven the nature of her mental health issues. (Government Exhibit 2 at 10.)\n(Emphasis in original.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMHC stated her CONSLUSIONS: \nBased on information gathered through the assessment, [Applicant] \npresents with a significant mental health history with active indications of \ndelusional ideation and disorganization in thinking. Due to her distortions in \nperception, there are considerable concerns about her judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness at this time, as well as her long-term prognosis. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 10.) \nApplicant began seeing an Adult Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (NP) \nafter her discharge from the mental hospital in January 2020. NP\u2019s CV is Applicant Exhibit \nK. NP prescribes medication for Applicant to attempt to control her condition. NP sees \nApplicant every one to two months for medication control and therapy.

These symptoms have \npersisted since childhood in varying capacities. \nShe has been treated for these symptoms with psychotropic medications \nand individual therapy and has developed great insight over time. She has \nlearned to manage her symptoms, many of which have completely \nsubsided, in a way that has allowed her to live a comfortable and successful \nlife with no known deficits in her employment or personal life to date. \nNP submitted a second statement after the hearing. (Applicant Exhibit L.) The \ndocument stated in pertinent part: \nAfter review of document Guideline I, it is in my assessment that [Applicant] \nhas maintained steady medication and treatment compliance voluntarily \nsince her release from the hospital in January 2020. Her psychiatric \nsymptoms have remained well controlled and in remission because of her \ncommitment to this treatment. She meets with me monthly and prognosis is \ngood. \nBased on her presentation and treatment progress over the past 2\u00bd years, \nI have no reason to believe that she would experience a relapse of \nsymptoms similar to the episode experienced in January 2020 as long as \nshe maintains compliance with medications and mental health treatment. \nApplicant testified that the incident in January 2020 was a \u201cSingular incident. One-\ntime thing.\u201d She further testified that nothing like that had occurred before or after the \nincident. (Tr. 44.) \nIn conclusion Applicant stated, \u201cI believe I deserve a Security Clearance. I\u2019ve done \nnothing wrong, and I\u2019m a credit to having a Security Clearance.

(Applicant Exhibits A, B, C, D, F, and\nH.) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions may be applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nThe record shows that Applicant has been suffering from severe and chronic \nmental health issues, including depression, for decades. Applicant, MHC, and NP, all \nagree on that point. AG \u00b6 28(a) applies to this case. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2021 MHC found that Applicant had a condition that may impair her judgment, \nstability, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nApplicant was involuntarily committed for two weeks of inpatient mental health \ntreatment after she engaged in violent and bizarre behavior. AG \u00b6 28(c) applies. \nThe Government has met its burden under the Directive to establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAs stated, Applicant has been suffering with severe mental health issues for many \nyears. However, other than that bare statement there is little evidence in the record to \nshow the extent of the problems and the care Applicant had been receiving prior to her \ninvoluntary hospitalization in 2020. \nMHC expressed several serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s stability in her well-\nreasoned report. Of particular concern was Applicant\u2019s apparent inability to rationally \ndiscuss her situation and treatment in depth. I agree. The majority of her answers to \nquestions by her counsel, Department Counsel, and me, were monosyllabic. When asked \nspecific questions about providers before NP, Applicant was unable to provide \ninformation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNP stated that Applicant\u2019s symptoms are well controlled with medication, but that \nis a conclusory statement and insufficient under the circumstances. The record is bereft \nof progress or interview notes that would show the extent of Applicant\u2019s alleged progress \nsince her hospitalization. \nMHC wrote an extensive report that discussed several issues concerning \nApplicant\u2019s mental health, in particular her history of disorganized thinking and distortions \nin perception. NP\u2019s statements did not sufficiently overcome the conclusions of MHC. \nThe strictures of the Guidelines as written require more from Applicant in terms of \nconsistency of treatment and a current and favorable prognosis that rebuts the current \nreport by the Government\u2019s MHC. Given the state of the record I cannot find that Applicant \nhas sufficiently mitigated the security concerns raised by the evidence in this case. \nGuideline I is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. At the present time, the record \nevidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all but two of the allegations in the SOR, as further discussed below. For each allegation, she provided a brief explanation. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old. She is married with two adult daughters. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. She served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (USAFR) from 1986 until 2013, when she retired as a technical sergeant (E-6).

She has worked for her current employer since November 2017. She has maintained a clearance since her time in the USAFR. (Items 3, 9) This case resulted from her 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) accessed through the DOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation Program. That CBR noted that Applicant had incurred over $80,000 in delinquent debts.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 30, 2022, and requested a decision by \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) based \non the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. She provided a recent credit \nreport, which I have admitted, without objection, as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. \nOn February 24, 2023, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 9. \nDOHA mailed the FORM to Applicant the same day, and she received it on March 13, \n2023. She was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit materials in response, \nand to object to the Government\u2019s evidence. \nOn or about May 2, 2023, having received no response from Applicant, the case \nwas forwarded to the DOHA hearing office. The case was assigned to me on June 1, \n2023. Government Items 1 and 2, the SOR and the Answer, are the pleadings in the case. \nGovernment Items 3 through 9 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all but two of the allegations in the SOR, as further discussed \nbelow. For each allegation, she provided a brief explanation. Her admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. She is married with two adult daughters. She earned her \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. She served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (USAFR) from 1986 \nuntil 2013, when she retired as a technical sergeant (E-6). (Items 3, 9) She was on active \nduty from about 2009 to 2012 and returned to work in the defense industry in 2013. She \nhas worked for various defense contractors since then. She has worked for her current \nemployer since November 2017. She has maintained a clearance since her time in the \nUSAFR. (Items 3, 9) \nThis case resulted from her 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) accessed through the \nDOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation Program. That CBR noted that Applicant had incurred over \n$80,000 in delinquent debts. (Item 5) \nApplicant disclosed on her January 2020 SCA that she had unfiled federal income \ntax returns, state and federal income tax debts, and about $90,000 in federal student \nloans, for which she said she was on a bi-weekly payment plan. (Item 3) She discussed \nher various debts at length in her September 2020 background interview. (Item 9) \nIn the fall of 2021, Applicant responded to an interrogatory from the DOD CAF \nabout her various debts, chiefly her federal student loans and her federal taxes. Her \nresponse is undated, but the documentation she provided from the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) is dated in September and October 2021.

Applicant \nacknowledged that her admitted debts had not been paid. (Items 1, 2; AE A) The non-tax \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by CBRs in the record, from August 2019, \nAugust 2020, January 2022, and February 2023. (Items 5 \u2013 9) The tax debts and unfiled \nreturns alleged are established by Applicant\u2019s 2021 Interrogatory Response. (Item 4) \nApplicant explained in her background interview that her tax and other financial \nissues began after she retired from her most recent period of active duty as an activated \nAir Force Reservist, in 2013. She made a good income on active duty and found it difficult \nto replicate that income in civilian life. She began working as a part-time contractor and \ndid not have health insurance. She and her husband incurred medical debts they could \nnot afford to repay. She also used federal student loans to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nDue to her underemployment and limited income at the time, she depleted her federal \nThrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement pension. Since she was not over the age of 59\u00bd, \nshe had to pay penalties and taxes on the withdrawals. State and federal income tax \ndebts resulted. (Item 9; Item 4 at 12) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m concern Applicant\u2019s unresolved federal student loans, \nwhich total $76,645. (Items 5-7) The SOR alleges that the debts \u201cwere in delinquent status \nprior to being placed in forbearance due to the pandemic.\u201d (Item 1) In her Answer, \nApplicant admitted these debts and acknowledged that she had not made any student \nloan payments. She asserted that the garnishment of her student loan payments was \nstopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Item 1) \nApplicant\u2019s CBRs from August 2020 and January 2022 show several federal \nstudent loan accounts as being past-due and in collection status. (Item 6 at 7-10, Item 7 \nat 2-5) A February 2023 CBR submitted by the Government shows that Applicant has 13 \nUSDOE loans, totaling the same $76,645 as alleged. Those loans are listed as \u201cPays \naccount as agreed.\u201d (Item 8) \nThe U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) paused collection of federal student \nloans beginning in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This likely explains why \nthey are currently in good standing, since Applicant acknowledged that she has not made \nany payments on them. However, the USDOE\u2019s COVID-19 student loan forbearance \nprogram is ending. On September 1, 2023, interest resumes, and payments will be due \nbeginning in October 2023. See https://www.usa.gov/covid-student-loan-help. \nApplicant also asserted in her Answer, without further detail and without \ndocumented corroboration, that \u201csubmittal of Debt Forgiveness has not been processed.\u201d \nThis is probably a reference to President Biden\u2019s proposed plan to forgive several \nthousand dollars of many borrowers\u2019 federal student loans. That plan was held to be \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Biden v. Nebraska, No. 22-506, __ U.S.__, June \n30, 2023 (available on the Supreme Court\u2019s website, https://www.supremecourt.gov) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant explained in her September 2020 background interview that she dropped \nout of graduate school in 2015 and was supposed to begin repayments on her loans soon \nthereafter, but she only made payments \u201chere and there\u201d and her loans soon became \ndelinquent. She asserted, without corroborating evidence, that she had been paying $379 \nmonthly at the time her payments were halted due to the COVID-19 debt relief program. \n(Item 9 at 4-5) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n ($1,472), 1.o ($185), and 1.p ($791), 1.r ($579), 1.s ($268), and 1.t \n($53) are past-due medical debts that have been placed for collection. (Items 6, 7) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s. I construe her failure to respond to SOR \n\u00b6 1.p as a denial. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.t on the basis that it had been paid, without \nproviding corroborating evidence. \nThe debt at SOR \u00b6 1.o ($185) is not established by the record, although one \nunalleged medical debt in the amount of $180 is listed on several CBRs. (Item 5, Item 6 \nat 11) As of January 2022, that unalleged debt shows a zero balance. (Item 7 at 5). SOR \n\u00b6 1.o is found in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.q ($676) is a debt placed for collection to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA). (Item 5 at 2 for $676, Item 6 at 11 for $1,106) Applicant admitted the debt \nand said she was unsure of the balance. She explained in her background interview that \nthe debt is an overpayment of GI Bill education benefits that she believed had been paid. \nShe did not proffer any evidence corroborating the purported payment. The debt does not \nappear on more recent CBRs. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u ($1,769) and 1.v ($2,999) concern past-due federal income tax debt \nfor tax years (TY) 2020 and 2017, respectively. (Item 4 at 18, 28-32) Applicant admitted \nthat these debts have not been paid. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x allege that Applicant failed to file her 2018 and 2019 state \nand federal income tax returns on time, as required, and that those returns remain unfiled. \nIRS records reflect that they have \u201cno record of return filed\u201d for those years. (Item 4 at 23, \n27) Applicant answered both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x by stating, \u201cI admit that this debt [sic] \nhas not been paid [sic].\u201d (Item 2) I construe her answer as admitting both allegations. She \nprovided no documentation that she has filed any of the federal or state  returns for TY \n2018 or 2019. \nApplicant disclosed tax debt on her SCA and discussed her taxes in her \nbackground interview. She was asked in the DOHA interrogatory to provide copies of her \nstate and federal tax returns from 2012-2019. (Item 4 at 2) Only the state returns for TY \n2018 and 2019 are alleged in the SOR. It is not clear from the record why Applicant has \nfailed to file those returns. \nBut for a December 2022 CBR (AE A), Applicant provided no documentation with \nher Answer about her recent finances, and she provided no documentation related to any \nsubsequent debt payments, tax payments, or tax filings.

She did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM, so she provided no updated \ninformation since her Answer. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant experienced financial problems beginning in about 2013, after she left \nactive duty and retired from the USAFR. She had difficulty finding full-time employment \nand health insurance. She used federal student loans to pursue and complete a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. She also depleted the funds in her TSP retirement plan, which led to \nunintended tax consequences. All these factors led to the delinquent debts and tax issues \nin the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) all apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

None of her alleged debts \nhave been paid or resolved, and she has unfiled tax returns as well. She has not \nestablished good-faith compliance with tax payments or tax filing requirements and has \nnot established a track record of steady payments towards any of her debts. Her federal \nstudent loans are not currently in delinquent status due to the COVID-19 forbearance \nprogram, which mitigates her inaction since March 2020. However, she did not proffer \nevidence sufficient to establish a track record of payments and financial responsibility in \naddressing her significant federal student loan debt before March 2020, and her student \nloans remain outstanding. Her various debts and tax issues continue to cast doubt on her \ncurrent judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts may have begun during a period of \ntransition from the Air Force but that was several years ago. At this point her debts and \ntax issues are largely due to her own failures to address them responsibly and not due to \ncircumstances beyond her control. \nApplicant has not demonstrated that she is acting in good faith. She provided no \ndocumentation to suggest that she has taken concrete steps to address her debts \nresponsibly or to file her outstanding returns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to/ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has not provided enough evidence to \nshow that she is acting responsibly in addressing her long-term delinquent debts and \nstudent loans. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s continued eligibility for access to classified information. She did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for continued \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He served in the Navy Reserve from 2006 until 2012, when he \nreturned to active duty with the Navy until July 2020, when he was released with a bad-\nconduct discharge. (Tr. 22-27, 55-57; GE 1, 6) \nIn April and May 2018, while working at the DOD Inspector General (DOD IG) \nHotline Center, on two separate occasions, Applicant used his cell phone to take under-\nthe-dress photographs of two of his female colleagues (collectively the \u201cvictims\u201d) without \ntheir knowledge or consent. One of the victims notified the U.S. Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service (NCIS), which opened an investigation into the incident. Based \nupon the NCIS investigation, the Navy charged him under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ) Article 120c (other sexual misconduct: indecent viewing, visual \nrecording, or broadcasting). In 2019, after a court-martial, he pleaded guilty and was \nconvicted of this charge. He was sentenced to eight months confinement and reduction \nin rank. He was released with a bad-conduct discharge. In SOR \u00b6 1.a, the Government \nalleged Applicant\u2019s 2018 behavior in taking the photographs. In SOR \u00b6 2.a, it alleged his \nconviction and sentence pursuant to UCMJ Article 120c. It also alleged a violation of \nUCMJ Article 92, failure to obey an order or regulation charge and conviction and his \nbad-conduct discharge in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In the Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. Other than his \nadmission, there is no evidence of a 2019 UCMJ Article 92 charge or conviction. (Tr. \n18-21; 27-32; Answer; GE 1-3, 6; AE A) \nApplicant claimed that he was going through a bad time between 2015 and 2018. \nHe claimed he and his wife were having marital problems. He claimed he was \ndissatisfied with his job and did not want to be there. He claimed that there was nothing \nsexual about the pictures he took, but that he was acting out to get caught. He thought \nthat if he got in trouble, the Navy would move him to a different role. He was having \ntrouble with his life and did not know how to handle it. He claimed his time in \nconfinement gave him clarity and he is now in a better place. He claimed that he took \n\u201cmultiple hours\u201d of behavioral counseling where he learned that he had post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He did not specify the dates of his counseling \nsessions. He did not provide documentation related to this counseling, a diagnosis, or a \nprognosis. He claimed that he now understands how to appropriately deal with stress, \nand that he will not engage in this type of behavior again.

(ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, \n2017)). (Tr. 32-35; GE 2) \nIn about April 2018, Applicant was counseled at work for making inappropriate \ncomments to a female colleague regarding her appearance. His inappropriate \ncomments made his female colleague feel uncomfortable, so she filed a complaint \nagainst him. Applicant\u2019s supervisor told him that he would be reassigned if anything \nsimilar happened again. The Government did not allege this information in the SOR. \n(GE 2) \nWhile Applicant claimed to be remorseful for his actions, he also deflected the \nblame and responsibility for his actions to others. He claimed the court-martial process \nwas unfair as he was not allowed to tell his side of the story. He claimed that he had \nbeen caught up in the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement and was judged more harshly than \nappropriate because of the timing of his offenses. He claimed that the victims were \ncoerced into requesting that he receive a harsher sentence than they otherwise might \nhave. He also claimed that he would not receive a fair outcome from his security \nclearance adjudication. In short, he casts himself as the victim and has not fully taken \nresponsibility for his illegal actions. (Answer; AE A) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent financial accounts \ntotaling approximately $29,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.f). Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and 1.e. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. Despite his denials, the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f are established by the Government\u2019s 2020, 2021, and \n2023 credit reports. (SOR; Answer; GE 4-7) \nThe judgments entered in April 2018 and January 2020 in favor of Applicant\u2019s \nhomeowner\u2019s association alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b have not been resolved. \nApplicant claimed that he made a payment of about $4,000 toward these judgments \nsometime in 2022. He also claimed that he is paying a little bit extra towards these \nobligations every month. He provided no documentation to corroborate these payments. \nHe is unsure how he fell behind on payments to his homeowner\u2019s association but \nsuspected his wife was supposed to pay this obligation and failed to do so. He claimed \nhe will continue to pay a little extra every month until these judgments are resolved. (Tr. \n20, 35-38, 60-61; Answer; GE 8) \nThe delinquent car loan in the amount of $6,499 alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c has not \nbeen resolved.

He provided no documentation about the resolution of this debt. (Tr. 20, \n38-43, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7, 9) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $2,927 alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d has not \nbeen resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not open this account and he disputed it \nwith the credit reporting agencies several times. The account was opened in September \n2015. He claimed that his wife had power of attorney for him while he was deployed and \nmay have opened it without his knowledge. The last time he deployed was between \nFebruary and October 2014. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his \ndisputes with the credit reporting agencies or the creditor, nor did he offer any other \nresolution of this debt. The Government\u2019s 2020, 2021, and 2023 credit reports do not \nreflect a dispute with respect to this account. This account appears on all three credit \nreports. The 2023 credit report reflects a last payment date of September 2016. (Tr. 20, \n40, 43-46, 59-60; Answer; GE 4-7) \nThe delinquent car loan in the amount of $9,909 alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.e has not \nbeen resolved. Applicant claimed that he took out this loan to purchase a car for his wife \nbecause she could not afford to pay for it herself. He opened the account in April 2017 \nand last made a payment on it in July 2019. He claimed that he did not know the loan \nwas delinquent because his wife was receiving the statements for it. He also claimed \nthat he could not afford to pay for the vehicle, but he agreed to open the account for his \nwife as an act of kindness. He claimed that he will pay this account through payment \narrangements when he is able to do so. (Tr. 20, 44-45, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7) \nThe delinquent telecommunications account in the amount of $2,027 alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 3.f has been resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not open this account. He \nclaimed that he disputed it with the credit reporting agencies. Although he did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his dispute, the debt no longer appears on his \n2023 credit report. While this account\u2019s absence on a subsequent credit report could be \nfor reasons other than a favorable resolution, his claimed dispute, combined with the \nabsence of the account on a subsequent credit report, provide sufficient evidence of a \nfavorable resolution. (Tr. 20, 45-47, 58-59) \nApplicant owes the IRS about $900 in delinquent federal income taxes for the \n2018 tax year. He owed about $3,000 until 2022, when he made a payment of about \n$2,100. These delinquent federal taxes were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48) \nApplicant earns between $83,000 and $84,000 in annual wages. He earns about \n$5,200 per month.

(Tr. 25-26, 53-58) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment.  \nApplicant engaged in criminal sexual behavior when he took under-the-dress \nphotographs of two female colleagues. He was convicted and spent time in \nconfinement. His actions, while surreptitious, were performed in public and reflected a \nlack of judgment. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable and the burden \nshifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance, with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nWhile Applicant last engaged in this behavior almost five years ago, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence that it is unlikely to recur and that it does not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He engaged in this behavior \nmultiple times, including with his wife prior to the incident with his colleagues. He \nengaged in this behavior because he was experiencing stress at work and with his \nmarriage. Neither of these circumstances is unusual. He has minimized the severity of \nhis actions and refused to accept full responsibility for his deceitful and dehumanizing \nbehavior. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. \nApplicant provided no evidence that either his employer or family are aware of \nhis criminal behavior. Information of a criminal and sexual nature such as this, if made \nknown, could be embarrassing and could result in a loss of employment. It could \ntherefore be used as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6 14(c) does not \napply. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was not private or consensual. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. \nWhile Applicant claimed that he underwent behavioral counseling, he provided \nno evidence that he is currently enrolled or that he completed a treatment program. He \npresented no evidence of a treatment plan or a favorable diagnosis. AG \u00b6 14(e) does \nnot apply. None of the sexual behavior mitigating factors are applicable. The sexual \nbehavior security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s behavior are not mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nIn 2018, Applicant engaged in criminal conduct when he took under-the-dress \nphotographs of his colleagues. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to a UCMJ Article 120 charge \nrelated to this behavior. As a result of this behavior, he was discharged from the Navy \nfor bad conduct. He was not charged with or convicted of a crime under UCMJ Article \n92. I find in his favor with respect to that portion of the allegation under Guideline J. \nOtherwise, the evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor the reasons set forth in the analysis of AG \u00b6 14(b), Applicant provided \ninsufficient evidence that his criminal behavior is unlikely to recur. For those same \nreasons, his behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \nThe almost five years that have passed without recurrence of criminal activity \nprovide some evidence of successful rehabilitation. Applicant provided no evidence of \nrestitution, job training, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. He has taken some technical classes since his conviction. AG \u00b6 32(d) \npartially applies. However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not compel a \nfavorable adjudication. Instead, I must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide \nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or vice versa. Despite the \nfive years that have passed without criminal conduct, given the seriousness of his crime \nand his failure to fully take responsibility for it, I cannot find that the criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has five delinquent debts totaling about $27,000. Several of \nthese debts have been delinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nprovide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAt the outset, Applicant has successfully disputed the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 3.f. I \nfind in his favor with respect to that allegation. Applicant\u2019s other financial delinquencies \nare ongoing and therefore recent. He has an additional delinquent federal tax debt that \nis not listed in the SOR. His behavior in failing to pay his debts is not infrequent. The \nevidence does not show that his debts are resolved or are under control. He has not \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. I cannot find his financial issues are \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial issues arose because he was incarcerated for \ncommitting a crime and because he failed to pay adequate attention to his finances. \nThese conditions were not beyond his control. Despite his assertion that he has made \npayments on some of the SOR debts, he provided no documents to corroborate these \npayments. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2016). AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nIn addition to the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 3.f, Applicant disputed the legitimacy of the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 3.d. He claimed he never opened the account listed in SOR \u00b6 3.d. He did \nnot provide documentary corroboration that he disputed the debt with the creditor or the \ncredit reporting agencies. The Government\u2019s credit reports do not show that Applicant \ndisputed this debt. As opposed to the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.f, the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.d appears \nin a credit report subsequent to his alleged dispute. He has not provided sufficient \nevidence of his actions to resolve his dispute with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 3.d. AG \u00b6 20(e) \npartially applies as it applies to the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.f. None of the other financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D, J, and F in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances and his military service, despite \nreceiving a bad-conduct discharge. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nmitigate the sexual behavior, criminal conduct, or financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (Except for the \nalleged UCMJ Article 92 charge, \nwhich I find for Applicant) \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.
