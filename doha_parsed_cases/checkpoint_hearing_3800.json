He had periods of unemployment and underemployment. He also \nadmitted that he lived beyond his means. He was unable to pay all of his bills and a \nnumber of debts became delinquent. (Tr. at 15-16, 20, 23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 2; AE A) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling about $35,640. Applicant \nadmitted that he owed all of the debts, but he stated that he was paying one of them, \nand the creditors for the remaining three debts charged off the debts as bad debts and \n\u201creleased [him] from any obligation to pay the debt[s].\u201d The debts include two credit \ncards, an account that he used to buy a motorcycle, and the deficiency owed on an auto \nloan after the vehicle was repossessed. \nApplicant paid a $1,607 debt that was not alleged in the SOR in April 2020. He \npaid a $570 debt that was not alleged in the SOR in 2020 or early 2021. (Tr. at 34-35; \nGE 2-6; AE H) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nJuly 7, 2021. He reported the SOR debts. He stated that with his new job, he would be \nable to satisfy all of his debts within a few months. He stated that he contacted the \ncreditor for one debt and he had \u201cbegun making minimum monthly payments of $50 [per \nmonth] until the debt is resolved.\u201d He stated that he also contacted the three remaining \ncreditors, and he was \u201cmaking minimum $50 monthly payments\u201d on one debt; and he \nwould start making $50 and $100 monthly payments on the last two debts. (GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation on July 30, 2021. He \ndiscussed his finances and delinquent debts. He indicated that he made payments on \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in 2020 while he was working overseas. He \nadmitted that he had not made any of the payments reported in the SF 86. Credit \nreports show that as of the date of the SOR, no payments on any of the SOR debts had \nbeen received since 2018. (Tr. at 24, 27-28; GE 2-6) \nApplicant entered into an agreement with the collection company for the $9,667 \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b on April 6, 2022, the same date he responded to the SOR. \nHe agreed to pay $62 every week for 156 weeks, through March 2025. He documented \nthat he made all of the weekly payments through October 2022, except one payment in \nAugust 2022 was returned for nonsufficient funds (NSF).

(Tr. at 25, 36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, \nB, E, I) \nApplicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in October 2022 to assist \nhim in resolving his debts. He enrolled six debts, totaling $43,359, in the company\u2019s \ndebt-resolution program (DRP). The four debts alleged in the SOR, including the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b that he was paying, were included in the DRP. He agreed to make $320 \npayments twice a month to an escrow account. The debt-settlement company agreed to \nnegotiate settlements with his creditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow \naccount, minus their fees, to pay the settlements. The company estimated a payoff \namount of $31,368, with an estimated debt-free date of November 30, 2026. Applicant \ndocumented that he made the first two $320 payments. (Tr. at 24-32, 37; AE F, G) \nApplicant\u2019s finances have stabilized. His fianc\u00e9e is self-employed, and they are \nstaying with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents. He has done a lot of studying, and he has adopted \nthe sound advice of experts on managing his finances. He stated that he is committed \nto maintaining the DRP through its resolution and paying his debts. He has a job offer \nfrom the parent company of his current employer for a cleared position, contingent upon \nhim receiving a security clearance. If he is granted a security clearance and gets that \njob, his finances will improve. He will lose his current job if he does not obtain a security \nclearance. (Tr. at 30-34, 40-43; AE A, D, J, K) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment after he left the \nmilitary because his father promised him a job that never materialized. He also admitted \nthat he lived beyond his means. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were partially beyond his \ncontrol. \nApplicant did not pay any of the SOR debts before he received the SOR, but he \nis credited with paying or settling two smaller debts before it was issued. He entered \ninto an agreement with one creditor to pay $62 every week for 156 weeks, through \nMarch 2025. From April 2022 through October 2022, he paid a total of $1,735 and \nreduced the balance owed to $7,994. He contracted with a debt-settlement company in \nOctober 2022 and enrolled the SOR debts in the company\u2019s DRP. He agreed to make \n$320 payments twice a month. He documented that he made the first two $320 \npayments. His finances have stabilized, and he asserted that he is committed to \nmaintaining the DRP through its resolution and paying his debts. \nEven with the small amount of payments to the SOR debts, this case could have \ngone Applicant\u2019s way if his payments matched his previous assertions. He wrote in his \nSF 86 that he had begun making $50 monthly payments on two debts and that he would \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstart making $50 and $100 monthly payments on the other two debts. He told the \nbackground investigator that he made payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b in 2020 while he was working overseas. None of those statements turned out to \nbe true. What I am left with is Applicant\u2019s statement that he intends to pay his debts \nthrough the DRP. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not \na substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to eliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He received a high \nschool diploma in 2006 and has taken some undergraduate courses. He was married in \n2013 and divorced in December 2019. He has a one-year-old child. He served on active \nduty with the U.S. Army from 2009 until May 2018 and received a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions. (Items 2-5; Form Response) \nOn an unspecified date, Applicant paid another individual to pose as Applicant to \ntake an information technology certification exam on his behalf because he did not \nbelieve that he could pass it if he took the certification exam himself. The individual that \nApplicant hired passed the certification exam, and Applicant was awarded the Security+ \nthrough COMPTIA certification as a result of his dishonest actions. This certification was \neither required for Applicant\u2019s employment or would enhance his standing with his \nemployer. In April 2021, Applicant reported this conduct to his employer, apologized for \nhis behavior, and resigned from his employment. It is unclear from the record whether \nhe reported this conduct prior to being confronted with it. (Items 1, 2, 6; Response to \nFORM). \nIn July 2017, Applicant was driving while intoxicated by alcohol. Military police \nstopped him after witnessing him fail to stop at a stop sign. They gave Applicant three \nportable breathalyzer tests. The results showed Applicant had a .116, .102, and .092 \nblood alcohol content (BAC). Applicant had been drinking at a bar for several hours and \ndrove home to meet base curfew. He was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). \nAbout three weeks later, because of the DWI, he was disciplined pursuant to the \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 15. Applicant\u2019s rank was reduced, he \nwas sentenced to 45 days of extra duty and 45 days restriction. He was ordered to \nattend an Army Substance Abuse Program and was administratively separated from the \nArmy with a general discharge under honorable conditions in February 2018. (Items 2-5, \n7) \nIn about September 2017, Applicant physically assaulted his ex-spouse after \ngetting into an argument with her. Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse alleged that he body-slammed \nher, causing her to strike her arm heavily on a dresser and the floor. Applicant claimed \nthat he did not touch his ex-spouse, and that she struck him. Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse \ndenied striking him, claiming that she merely knocked his breakfast on the floor. Military \npolice responded to the incident. They noted bruising on Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse\u2019s arm \nconsistent with her version of events. Applicant claimed that his ex-spouse slipped on a \nshoe and fell into a dresser. Military police also noted scratches on Applicant\u2019s arm. He \nclaimed that his ex-spouse called military police because she thought she would get in \ntrouble for striking him. Applicant was arrested by military police but not formally \ncharged. While he was being questioned by military police, he alleged that he and his \nex-spouse had not had domestic abuse issues in the past. However, he acknowledged \nto a social worker during counseling that he and his ex-spouse had similar incidents in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2013 and February 2017. He claimed that these incidents involved his ex-spouse \nassaulting him. Regardless, this information is inconsistent with what he told military \npolice about the September 2017 incident being the first. In October 2017, the Army \nFamily Advocacy Program Case Review Committee determined that Applicant\u2019s ex-\nspouse qualified as a victim of physical abuse based upon this incident. In March 2019, \nthe Army authorized payments to Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse under a federal law that \nprovides for compensation to family members who have been physically abused by \nArmy servicemembers. These findings tend to corroborate his ex-spouse\u2019s version of \nevents. In 2019, Applicant and his (ex) spouse were divorced. (Items 2-5, 7-11) \nApplicant underwent outpatient mental health counseling in parts of 2012, 2015, \n2016, and from March 2017 until November 2017, while he was in the military. Applicant \nattended ASAP for approximately three months and a licensed psychologist diagnosed \nhim with an alcohol use disorder-mild. While Applicant was initially told to abstain from \nalcohol, his treatment records acknowledged that he could eventually consume alcohol \nagain in a modified, lower risk manner. Applicant abstained from alcohol from \napproximately July 2017 until the end of December 2019, when he began drinking about \ntwo glasses of wine two times per week. The last time he was intoxicated was July \n2017. He acknowledged formerly having a problem with alcohol. However, he claimed \nthat he now drinks responsibly and no longer has alcohol-related issues. (Items 2-5, 7) \nApplicant claimed that he is remorseful for the conduct listed in the SOR. \nHowever, he reiterated his claim that he did not physically assault his ex-spouse. He \nclaimed that he is trying to better himself through his college education and making \nbetter decisions. He twice made the dean\u2019s list at his college. He also claimed that he \nhas learned from his mistakes and that the birth of his one-year-old child has \ncontributed to his desire to be a better person. He provided character reference letters \nfrom those who know him who claim that he is trustworthy, responsible, dedicated, \nshows integrity, and is hard working. Some of the individuals who wrote letters note that \nhe has learned from his mistakes, but it is unclear whether any of these individuals are \naware of the allegations in the SOR. (Item 2; Response to FORM) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information. \nApplicant paid another individual to take a certification exam for him that was \neither required by his employer or would benefit his standing with his employer. He \ngained the certification under false pretenses. He then resigned from his employment \nbased upon this untrustworthy behavior. This behavior is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline, and it constitutes untrustworthy or unreliable behavior. AG \u00b6 16(d) \nis established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n (a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is not minor. It showed extremely poor judgment and a high \nlevel of dishonesty. He engaged in this gross breach of trust only about two years ago. \nWhile he reported the behavior, he provided no evidence as to whether he reported it in \ngood faith as opposed to reporting it because he knew he would be caught. He also \nprovided no evidence as to when he engaged in the behavior, so he cannot show that \nhis reporting was prompt. While he acknowledged the behavior, he provided no \nevidence of counseling after he engaged in the behavior. He has been taking college \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncourses and has had a child, but he has not shown how these things change the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to his untrustworthy behavior. \nGiven the seriousness of the conduct and its relative recency, I cannot find that it is \nunlikely to recur. I find that this behavior still casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the Guideline E mitigating conditions \napply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-spouse made a credible allegation that Applicant physically \nassaulted her in September 2017. While he was not charged with a crime, the Army \ndetermined that his ex-spouse was the victim of physical abuse. Applicant also drove \nwhile intoxicated by alcohol in July 2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs it has been about five and one-half years since Applicant physically assaulted \nhis ex-spouse, at first blush, it would appear that a significant amount of time has \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npassed since he engaged in criminal behavior. However, I found that he physically \nassaulted his wife, which he continues to deny. I believe he is being untruthful about a \nmaterial fact relevant to a security clearance adjudication. Falsifying material \ninformation in a security clearance adjudication is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C.A. \n\u00a7 1001. Therefore, Applicant continues to engage in criminal behavior, undercutting his \nefforts at mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d), which require the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal acts. Given the recency of criminal activity, AG \u00b6 \n32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do not apply. AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply because there is reliable \nevidence of criminal conduct in the form of credible allegations, police reports, and the \naforementioned finding by the Army. None of the Guideline J mitigating conditions \napply. The criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \nIn 2017, Applicant drove while intoxicated and was charged and disciplined. Also \nin 2017, a psychiatrist diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder-mild. AG \u00b6 22(a), AG \u00b6 \n22(c), and AG \u00b6 22(d) are established. AG \u00b6 22(e) and AG \u00b6 22(f) are not established. \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant was advised to abstain from \nconsuming alcohol indefinitely. The evidence showed that his social worker envisaged \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan acceptable, lower risk form of alcohol consumption. Therefore, there is no evidence \nthat his current level of consuming two glasses of wine twice a week is inconsistent with \ntreatment recommendations. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \nIt has been about five and one-half years since Applicant has had an alcohol-\nrelated incident such as those described in AG \u00b6 22(a). He also has not been \nintoxicated since then. This extended length of time without alcohol-related incidents or \nintoxication provides sufficient evidence that Applicant no longer habitually consumes \nalcohol or \u201cbinges\u201d on alcohol to the extent that it impairs his judgment. The five and \none-half years that has elapsed is persuasive evidence that his excessive alcohol \nconsumption is unlikely to recur, and that it no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The alcohol consumption security concerns are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, J, and G in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service and his positive personal references. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the personal conduct or criminal conduct security concerns, but he did mitigate \nalcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The investigator was aware that Applicant had \nnot disclosed any illegal drug use during his previous investigation that had occurred \nabout ten years earlier. The investigator interrogated him further, and Applicant stated \nhe realized the investigator caught him in a lie. He was tired of lying about his marijuana \nuse and decided to disclose the full details about his marijuana use. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. \n17-21, 32-35) \nApplicant stated that even though he possessed a DOD security clearance at the \ntime he submitted the September 2021 SCA, he never had the intention to abstain from \nsmoking marijuana.

(Tr. 21) \nApplicant admitted that in August 1986, he was arrested and charged with \npossession of a controlled substance. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) He testified that he actually had two \nincidents of getting into trouble with the police for illegal drugs, but due to the age of the \narrest, he could not specifically recall any details about the incident. (Tr. 25-27; GE 2, \nGE 3) \nAccording to an interrogatory completed by Applicant on May 18, 2022, he listed \nthat he had used marijuana daily from January 1980 to May 17, 2022, and he had future \nintentions of using marijuana. Applicant testified that he did not use marijuana daily \nduring that entire period. When he was first hired by his employer, he believed he may \nhave abstained from using marijuana for about a year. He admitted during the hearing \nthat he continues to use marijuana. (GE 2; Tr. 27-29) \nApplicant admitted that he had also purchased marijuana while holding a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) He disclosed during his background interview that he \nspends about $100 every two months to purchase marijuana from a friend who \npossesses a medical marijuana card. He smokes marijuana in the evenings to relax and \nit also helps with his arthritis pain. He testified that in September 2022, he obtained a \nmedical marijuana card and he has recently purchased marijuana from a dispensary. \nHe provided documentation from September 2022 that his application to participate in \nhis state\u2019s medical marijuana program had been approved. He was aware the use of \nmarijuana is illegal under federal law, and that the Federal Government and his \nemployer have a policy against people holding a security clearance and using illegal \ndrugs. (GE 2; Tr. 29-32, 35-36; AE C, AE D) \nApplicant submitted two character reference letters from his direct supervisor and \nthe operations manager from his place of employment. Both references praised \nApplicant\u2019s outstanding work ethic and personal commitment to the mission. They \nbelieve Applicant is an asset for his employer and the DOD. (AE A, AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);\u201d and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase . . . .\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has used marijuana from about \n1980 to the present time, and during many of those years while he possessed a DOD \nsecurity clearance. He knew that the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, and \nthat the Federal Government and his employer have a policy against people holding a \nsecurity clearance and using illegal drugs. Applicant\u2019s purchase, possession, and use of \nmarijuana cast doubts on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and suitability to hold a \nclearance, especially because his substance misuse occurred while he possessed a \nclearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant deliberately falsified his September 2021 SCA by intentionally failing to \ndisclose his use and purchase of marijuana while holding a DOD security clearance. \nDuring his November 2021 background interview, he deliberately falsified his marijuana \nhistory when questioned by an investigator. His admissions and evidence in the record \nshow that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant intentionally falsified his 2021 \nSCA, and he deliberately failed to disclose his illegal drug use and purchase during his \nNovember 2021 background interview. He admitted he lied because he was worried \nabout losing his security clearance and his job. Applicant only admitted his illegal drug \ninvolvement to the investigator after he had been caught in a lie. This conduct does not \ndemonstrate a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his previous omissions and \nfalsifications. He has a pattern of dishonesty, which casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and overall good judgment. The personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on him to establish mitigation. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nI \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nAfter considering the record as a whole, to include his positive work performance \nand the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana, \nconclude that Applicant has not met his heavy burden of proof and persuasion due to \nhis longstanding and current use of marijuana, and his history of omissions and \nfalsification for over 20 years while he held a security clearance. His pattern of \ndishonesty and his intention to use marijuana in the future continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability and trustworthiness. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: Against Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nAugust 5, 2021. The Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 5, 2022, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct.

In February 2017, his wife had surgery and developed \ncomplications that kept her out of work for eight weeks. In that same month, \nhe retired from the Air Force and was working only two to three days a week. \nHe did not receive disability payments until April 2018. Those events caused \nfinancial hardship for his family.

(Item 1.) He denied that allegation. (Item 2.)  SOR \u00b6 2.c alleged that the May \n2014 SCA asked whether he had EVER been charged with any felony offense, including \nunder the UCMJ?

(Item \n1.) He denied those allegations. (Item 2.) He did not disclose those debts in his August \n2021 SCA. (Item 3.) \nIn addition to his short denials of the Guideline E allegations, Applicant submitted \na more detailed explanation, the pertinent part of which follows: \nThis is mostly to an oversight on my part, was not trying to deceive \nat all. I was charged in 2007 for an incident that happened back in 1997. It \nwent to an Article 32 hearing where the accusations were proven false and \nall the charges were dismissed. So that was my fault not thinking, because \nI was on the list for deployment I asked if this would affect it from what I can \nrecall my counsel telling me that since it was over and everything was \ndismissed it is like it never happened. So I was not trying to be untruthful. \nOn the 2014 Equip questionnaire I answered no and did not get any \nquestions back about this. Also when it was asked on the 2021 equip I was \nonly going back 10 years since I figured that was what was needed for a \nSecret Clearance. So again I was not trying to be untruthful was just looking \nat the scope. . . . (Item 2.)  \nThe record has a Charge Sheet showing that on April 16, 2007 Applicant was \ncharged under UCMJ Article 120 with a rape that took place on February 19,1999. (Item \n4 \n\n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n          \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.) After an investigation, on May 8, 2007, that charge was dismissed due to credibility \nissues of the accuser. (Response at 1-8.) \nIn his Response to the FORM, Applicant provided a detailed explanation of the \ncircumstances of the1999 alleged rape. His explanation recounted graphic descriptions \nof the day and the evening in question. He specifically denied the accusations made by \nthe accuser. He also provided details of exculpatory evidence. (Response at 9.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by the Government\u2019s credit reports. \nApplicant stated that he would not need to make any \u201cfinancial changes\u201d to pay off his \ndebts. And his Personal Financial Statement shows a healthy net monthly remainder \n($5,692). His Answer said that \u201cany debts incurred will be taken care of.\u201d They have not \nbeen. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.   \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR accounts became delinquent in 2017. That is fairly long ago. But \nthey remained in default at the time the SOR was issued. Also, those debts were not \ninfrequent. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to mitigate those debts. \nMitigating factor AG \u00b6 20(b) has two principal elements. First, there must be \n\u201cconditions\u201d \u201clargely beyond the [applicant\u2019s] control\u201d that caused the financial problem. \nSecond. The applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse circumstances \nhe confronted. \nYear 2017 presented Applicant with a number of challenging circumstances. His \nfather-in-law died unexpectedly in January. In February, his wife underwent surgery that \ncaused her to miss work for two months. And his disability checks were delayed until April \n2018. Those events caused financial hardship. They were \u201clargely beyond\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol, thus satisfying the first element of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly under those adverse \ncircumstances. In this case, he used credit cards to \u201ccover the lost [sic] of income.\u201d That \nis consistent with the credit reports showing the SOR accounts becoming delinquent in \n2017. By way of context, after her surgery, his spouse resumed work in about mid-2017. \nIn 2018, he worked full time as a contractor or as an employee for his current employer. \nAs noted, he began receiving disability payments in April 2018. Aside from making one \npayment on one SOR account in August 2021, he has made no payments to the other \nSOR accounts since 2016 or 2017. They apparently have been ignored. That is not \nresponsible conduct. The second element of AG \u00b6 20(b) is not satisfied. Applicant\u2019s SOR \ndebts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant stated that he is making or plans to make payments to the creditors of \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and b. He has not, however, provided any documents supporting that \nassertion. The Appeals Board has routinely held that it is reasonable to expect applicants \nto produce documentation supporting their efforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). Applicant has not satisfied that basic requirement. \nTherefore, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant stated that he has disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. c, e, and f. Mitigating condition \nAG \u00b6 20(e) requires \u201cdocumented proof\u201d to \u201csubstantiate the basis of the dispute\u201d or \n\u201cevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d He has provided neither. AG \u00b6 20 (e) does not \napply. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts have been resolved or mitigated. I find against \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d A statement or omission is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately \n(knowingly and willfully). \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose the \n2007 rape charge in his May 2014 SCA and his August 2021 SCA. He denied those \nallegations. The record, however, proves the truth of those allegations. He was charged \nwith rape on April 16, 2007. This conduct falls squarely within AG \u00b6 16(a), which states in \npertinent part: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations.  \nAG \u00b6 17(a) states in pertinent part a mitigating condition that may mitigate that \ndisqualifying condition: \n[The] individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nApplicant failed to disclose the 2007 rape charge in his May 2014 SCA and in his \nAugust 2021 SCA. This proceeding is not to revisit the legitimacy of the rape charge. It \nwas thoroughly Investigated by the Air Force, and the charge was dismissed. The issue \nhere is whether he deliberately omitted that charge from two SCAs. \nApplicant is correct that the charge was made when he was young and newly-\nmarried. A charge of felony rape, however, is momentous at any age. The three-week \ninvestigation before it was dismissed surely was personally distressful for him. But that \nepisode was only seven years before he needed to complete his May 2014 SCA. That he \nasked a lawyer about answering \u201cNo\u201d shows he had misgivings about that answer. \nWhen he completed the 2014 SCA and the 2021 SCA, he had over 20 years of \nexperience as an airman. He had held security clearances before. Moreover, the SCA \nquestion asked whether applicant had EVER been charged with a felony (emphasis \nadded)? That use of UPPER CASE letters is intended to call attention that the question \ngoes back EVER in time. Finally, perhaps the most telling evidence is the great level of \ndetail about the rape incident that he included in his Response to the FORM. These many \nyears later, that incident is still quite fresh in his memory. That is understandable, but it \nshould have been disclosed in his 2014 SCA. \nHaving omitted the rape charge from his 2014 SCA, Applicant was presented with \nan opportunity to correct that omission when he needed to complete the 2021 SCA. He \ndid not, however, use that opportunity to correct his 2014 omission. Instead, he omitted \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe rape charge from the 2021 SCA, as well. I find that he deliberately omitted the rape \ncharge from his 2014 and 2021 SCAs. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2 a.-d. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f in his 2014 and 2021 SCAs. He denied those \nallegations. The record shows, however, that he did not disclose those debts in those two \nSCAs. The question is whether that omission was deliberate. During the investigation, he \nrepeatedly denied having significant knowledge about his family finances. According to \nhim, his wife handled the family finances. That custom was interrupted in February 2017 \nwhen his wife had surgery, and he took over that chore while she recuperated. Applicant\u2019s \ninterrogatory responses show that even at this late date, his family finances are still not \nunder control. I attribute that, however, to carelessness or negligence, not to a deliberate \nomission of the SOR debts. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since February 2021. He earned a high school diploma in 2004. He has never been married and has no children. He served on active duty with the Army from June 2004 until February 2014, when he earned an honorable discharge. He deployed three times while he was in the Army. (Tr. 32-36, 61-62; GE 1, 2) Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2017 until November 2020. Throughout the time he used it, marijuana use did not violate state law in State A, where he resided. However, marijuana use and possession was, and continues to be, illegal under federal law. He started using marijuana to relax. He either used it through a vape pen or a joint. His marijuana use varied from one to two hits on the weekend from 2017 until 2019, to daily use from February 2020 to November 2020. He stopped using marijuana in November 2020 because he realized it was not helping his mental state and because he was moving in with his aunt, who did not want marijuana in her house.

He earned a high school diploma in 2004. He has never \nbeen married and has no children. He served on active duty with the Army from June \n2004 until February 2014, when he earned an honorable discharge. He deployed three \ntimes while he was in the Army. (Tr. 32-36, 61-62; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2017 \nuntil November 2020. Throughout the time he used it, marijuana use did not violate \nstate law in State A, where he resided. However, marijuana use and possession was, \nand continues to be, illegal under federal law. He started using marijuana to relax. He \neither used it through a vape pen or a joint. His marijuana use varied from one to two \nhits on the weekend from 2017 until 2019, to daily use from February 2020 to November \n2020. He stopped using marijuana in November 2020 because he realized it was not \nhelping his mental state and because he was moving in with his aunt, who did not want \nmarijuana in her house. He noticed an improvement in his mood and his mental state \nwithin days of ceasing his marijuana use. He does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture as he believes it is harmful to his mental health. (Tr. 26, 37-38, 47-49; Answer; \nGE 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $16,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). These delinquencies consist of an \noverdrawn bank account (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a vehicle loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), unpaid automobile \ninsurance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f), a utility (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He \nadmitted the SOR allegations with additional comment. His admissions are adopted as \nfindings of fact. (SOR; Answer) \nThe overdrawn bank account in the amount of $11,469 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has \nnot been resolved. Applicant overdrew this account when he quit his job in February \n2020 and failed to stop previously scheduled automatic withdrawals. He claimed that he \nthought the balance was inaccurate and, when he called the collection agency in June \n2022, it allegedly agreed that he only owed $1,469. On June 10, 2022, he made a \npayment of $105 on this account. He provided documentation to corroborate this \npayment. He did not provide documentation to corroborate the lower balance. He has \nnot taken additional action on this account after making the June 10, 2022 payment, but \nhe plans to do so in the future.

Applicant provided documentary evidence that, after the hearing, he \nmade a $100 payment on this account on March 21, 2023. The account became \ndelinquent in February 2019 when he voluntarily surrendered the secured collateral \nbecause he could not afford to make the required payments. Prior to his March 21, 2023 \npayment, he last made a payment on this account in April 2020. He plans to make \npayment on this account in the future.

Applicant first became delinquent on this account in \nDecember 2020. He claimed that he paid this account in full, but he only provided \ndocumentary corroboration of a $90 payment in September 2022. He claimed that he \nthought the account is no longer delinquent because it no longer appears on an \nundisclosed credit report.

Applicant claimed that he \npaid this account in full on an undisclosed date. He provided no documentary \ncorroboration of a payment. However, this debt appears on the Government\u2019s April \n2021 credit report, but not on the 2022 and 2023 Government credit reports. (Tr. 30-31, \n52-53, 74; Answer; GE 2 and 3) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to several causes. He was unemployed \nfrom February 2020 until December 2020 because he quit his job while suffering from \ndepression and loneliness. He claimed that his credit has been bad his whole life. He \nacknowledged that he does not pay sufficient attention to his finances partly because he \ndoes not care enough about them. While it is not alleged in the SOR, he has had two \nadditional vehicles repossessed in the past. Any adverse information not alleged in the \nSOR, such as Applicant\u2019s additional vehicle repossessions, will not be considered for \ndisqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He claimed that he will pay off the delinquent SOR accounts \nin the future, but he also made such claims multiple times beginning as early as March \n2021.

(Tr. 63-71) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $16,000. Many of those debts \nhave been delinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. Half of the \nSOR debts, including the two largest, remain unresolved. Given his statements about \nhis inability to save, budget, or pay attention to his finances, I cannot find that his \nfinancial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his unemployment when he quit his \njob. These conditions were beyond his control. However, his financial issues also arose \nbecause of his admitted negligence about his finances. These conditions were within his \ncontrol. To the extent conditions were beyond his control, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he \nmust also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these \ndebts. While he resolved some of the smaller SOR debts, he largely did so after he \nreceived the SOR. On several of the unresolved SOR debts, he made a relatively small \npayment after the SOR was issued, but he did not continue making payments. Given \nthese considerations, he has failed to show that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent debts came after he received \nthe SOR. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been \nplaced on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant disputed the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and claimed that the \ncreditor acknowledged that the balance is lower than that listed on the SOR. However, \nhe provided no documentary evidence to corroborate the lower balance. It is reasonable \nto expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Regardless, he admitted owing \na balance on the account, and acknowledged that except for one payment he made on \nthis account after the SOR was issued, this debt remains unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply. \nNone of the Guideline F mitigating factors are fully applicable.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant illegally purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout 2017 until November 2020. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nis potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has not purchased or used marijuana for over three years. This time \nspan is significant. He credibly testified that he will not purchase or use marijuana again \nbecause it negatively affects his mental state. Given the totality of his past drug use, his \ncredible testimony, and his lengthy period of refraining from use, I believe that he has \nestablished a sufficient period of abstinence from illegal drugs and that his illegal drug \npurchase and use is unlikely to recur. I conclude his past, illegal drug involvement does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. He mitigated the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees and earned credits \ntowards a master\u2019s degree. He was married to his first wife from December 2016 until she \npassed away in 2019. He remarried in March 2023. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a federal contractor, since 2015. (Tr. 20; GE 1) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s first marriage, his wife suffered from mental illness. She had a \nchild from a previous relationship, and Applicant treated his stepdaughter like his own. \nApplicant testified that he was aware his wife had experienced significant and intense \ntrauma in her past. She was abused by a previous boyfriend and had childhood trauma. \nShe was participating in talk therapy, cognitive therapy, and was on medication. He and \nhis first wife were together for about two and a half years before they married. He raised \nhis stepdaughter almost by himself from the age of three until she was seven years. His \nwife was a flight attendant and would be gone for extended periods of time, and Applicant \nwould care for the child. He and his stepdaughter had a close relationship. In early 2017, \nhe and his wife attended marriage counseling to address communication issues. The \ncounselor recommended he seek individual counseling. (Tr. 21-27, 79) \nApplicant sought mental health treatment from a health center (HC) in April 2017. \nHe reported to the mental health professional (MHP) that he was having difficulty focusing \nand concentrating. He was diagnosed with attention deficient/hyperactivity disorder \n(ADHD). He was prescribed medication. He stated that he also participated in treatment \nbrought on by his relationship with his wife who was undergoing treatment for depression \nand extreme post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He said she had an ongoing \ndiagnosis of alcoholism and borderline personality disorder. He explained that as her \npartner and a person who loved her, these conditions led to stress and trauma in dealing \nwith her behavior.

Applicant testified \nthat he now manages his ADHD through diet, sleep, and exercise and is no longer on \nmedication. (Tr. 22, 25-27, 42, 51-54; Answer to SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that his wife was prescribed medication for her mental health \nissues and was experiencing side effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. She was \nalso abusing alcohol. She had participated in alcohol detoxification a couple of times. Her \nmedications were changed, but her symptoms and side effects worsened. He testified \nthat he was arrested in August 2017 on charges of domestic violence. He testified that \nhis wife was not taking her prescribed medication, and he thought she was having \nflashbacks. He said that his wife attacked him, and he defended himself by wrapping his \narms around her. He had injuries to his face. He was arrested for domestic violence but \nthe charges were later dropped. (Tr. 29-30, 45-47, 55-59) \nApplicant testified that in August 2017, his wife left him, and she left her daughter \nin his care. He was the sole provider for his stepdaughter until November 2017 when the \npolice arrived at his home on Thanksgiving Day and escorted his stepdaughter from the \npremises. He understood that he had no legal rights to her, and he only ever saw her a \nfew more times. Applicant was distraught and grieving at the loss of his stepdaughter. In \nNovember 2017, he reported to his MHP that he was experiencing anxiety due to his \nseparation from his wife and loss of contact with his stepdaughter. He continued his \nregular appointments. (Tr. 22-25, 30, 62; Answer to the SOR) \nIn late December 2017, he learned that his wife had aborted their child. They had \ntried to conceive for two years but struggled due to his wife\u2019s physical health issues and \nwere unsuccessful. The combination of losing access to his stepdaughter and learning of \nthe abortion made him more depressed and mired in grief. In January 2018, he sought \ntreatment and was admitted to a mental health facility for suicidal ideations. He continued \nhis therapy to approximately April 2018 for grief because of the loss of his stepdaughter \nand familial stress. (Tr. 28-30, 66; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant disclosed on his January 2018 Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) that in January 2018 he purchased and used marijuana three times \nduring one weekend while living in a state where it is legal. He had a security clearance \nat the time but did not have access to classified information. He testified that because of \nall of the family issues he was experiencing, with the loss of custody of his stepdaughter, \nand the separation from his wife, he thought he would try marijuana to relieve the stress. \nHe believed because it was legal under state law, he was permitted to use it. He credibly \ntestified that he was unaware that he was not permitted to use marijuana under federal \nlaw, but also acknowledged he should have known better. He has not used marijuana \nsince that weekend and does not intend to use it in the future. He provided a signed letter \nof intent to never use or possess illegal drugs or misuse legal drugs in the future and \nagreed that his security clearance could be revoked if he violated his promise.

He \nprovided a letter from his mother who said she had visited her son in June 2018, and he \ndisclosed to her that he had used marijuana to help cope with the separation from his wife \nand stepdaughter. She had concerns about the policy of his employer because marijuana \nwas legal in the state where he lived. She said her son told her that he believed it was \npermissible to use. (Tr. 47; AE D, H, I, P) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was arrested for domestic violence against his wife. \nApplicant denied he committed any act of violence. He believed it was a plot devised by \nhis wife so he would be in jail and she could obtain items from the marital home. He \nindicated the incident was entirely fabricated and he had an alibi to her accusations in \nthat he was not where she claimed he was located. He believed the allegation was made \nto obtain legal leverage for their pending divorce or were attributed to his wife\u2019s mental \nhealth issues because he believed she was not taking her medications and was \nconsuming alcohol. He attributed her obtaining restraining orders against him in \nSeptember 2018 and May 2019 to the same purposes as noted above. The charges and \norders were all dismissed when Applicant\u2019s wife failed to appear in court. (Tr. 29-30, 41, \n45-47, 77; Answer to the SOR) \nDuring marriage counseling, Applicant disclosed that he was depressed and \nmentioned he had suicidal ideations. In December 2018, Applicant was at home and \nasleep. His wife tried to contact him by telephone and when he did not answer, she called \nthe police. He explained to the police that he was seeking treatment for grief and was \ndealing with depression, but it was being handled through his private MHP. For reasons \nunbeknownst to him they admitted him under the Baker Act to a mental health facility. \nApplicant believes this was an attempt by his wife to ruin his reputation and gain leverage \nin their divorce proceeding. Applicant admitted he had suicidal ideations but did not \nattempt suicide. (Tr. 31,37-41, 66, 82-87) \nApplicant\u2019s discharge summary from his December 2018 hospitalization notes that \nhe was communicating with his ex-wife and was venting and instead of her calming him, \nshe began screaming at him. He attempted to tell her that because of the way she treated \nhim and interacted with him, he had become suicidal in the past. That was the end of the \nconversation, until the police arrived at his door. He denied he had attempted to \ndeliberately harm himself. He had positives in this life and was gainfully employed. He \nwas receiving support from his mother and brother and had strong religious beliefs. He \nwas looking forward to a trip to India. He was discharged in January 2019 with a diagnosis \nby a medical doctor of depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, major depressive \ndisorder, single episode, unspecified, and unspecified depressive disorder. He testified \nthat he was told to continue seeing his therapist.

She last saw him in December 2019 when they \nmutually decided to terminate services. He testified that they agreed he had continued \ntherapy to the point where it was no longer necessary, and at that point he had a game \nplan to address any issues that may occur or bouts of grief he may experience. (Tr. 34-\n35, 66-75, 80-82, 87; AE C) \nApplicant testified that his wife attempted suicide five times while they were \nmarried. In September 2019, she succeeded. She left a suicide note, hung herself, and \nwas found weeks later at her house. It was determined that her cause of death was \nsuicide. (Tr. 45) \nOn January 17, 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a government-approved \npsychologist, Dr. B. Based on her clinical interview, available medical and mental health \ntreatment records, testing observations, and results of the Personality Assessment \nInventory (PAI), she determined Applicant met the criteria for major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent, severe in remission, bipolar disorder R/O1 and Cluster B personality traits.2 She \nnoted Applicant had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and domestic violence issues. \nHe also had episodes of increased energy and activity as well as episodes of major \ndepression. He was not in treatment for these conditions because she noted that \nApplicant felt he did not need mental health treatment. His prognosis was poor because \nhe was not interested in treatment, which Dr. B noted would need to be regular and \nongoing to prevent relapses of depression and possibly mania. She said due to \ninconsistencies she noted in information he provided to her and to the government \ninvestigator regarding his security clearance application it suggested he was dishonest. \nShe noted his use of marijuana while he had a security clearance, which he \nacknowledged, also gave her concerns, although she did not discuss this as impacting \nhis psychological issues. She had significant concerns about his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. (GE 4) \nApplicant testified that he disagreed with many things Dr. B stated in her report \nnoting they were inaccurate. He noted that his virtual evaluation was between one and \ntwo hours. Her conclusions that he perpetrated acts of domestic violence were not true. \nHe noted she opined that he had unpredictable and violent behavior, which was untrue \nand based on false reports from his ex-wife. He said Dr. B saw this as inconsistent \nreporting and dishonest. He adamantly disagreed with her interpretation and willingness \nto accept these accusations without considering his information. Dr B. concluded that he \nhad episodes of increased energy and activity, such as formulating a plan to travel to \n1 www.rxlist.com:Rule out (R/O) term used in medicine meaning to eliminate or exclude something from \nconsideration. For example, a normal chest x-ray may \u201crule out\u201d pneumonia. \n2 The DSM-5 notes that personality disorders under Cluster B, which is called the dramatic, emotional, and \nerratic cluster, include Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Histrionic \nPersonality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIndia, which were a concern. Applicant had planned a trip to India for a wedding that was \nsubsequently canceled because the wedding was canceled. He took a trip to Aruba after \nhe had completed his two bachelor\u2019s degrees because he was exhausted and not \nbecause he was using sleep as a coping mechanism for a manic episode. He denied he \nexhibited unpredictable and erratic behavior. He denied he lied and had recurring \nproblems with the law, was aggressive, violent, and impulsive. He also disagreed with her \nevaluation that he was dishonest. Dr. B noted that he was in a tumultuous relationship \nwith his wife and had suicidal ideations during this time, which prompted a diagnosis of \nmajor depressive disorder, and she had concerns that he was not currently in treatment. \nWhen he was evaluated by Dr. B, he was no longer married as his wife had been \ndeceased since 2019. She noted that he reported on his security clearance application \n(January 2020) that he was going through some hard times but was in therapy and doing \nbetter. She said if he did have some insight for treatment, he did not have it at the time of \nthe evaluation and therefore his prognosis was poor. (Tr. 32-33, 102-112; GE 4) \nApplicant was re-evaluated in June 2022 by a licensed psychologist (LC). The LC \nnoted that she had experience treating various disorders, particularly depressive \ndisorders. They discussed his past suicidal ideations, Baker Act hospitalization, the loss \nof his stepdaughter and ex-wife. They also discussed his history of grief and his past \ncounseling with Dr. MS. LC noted that Applicant reported that he was previously given \nthe Personality Assessment Inventory and the screening yielded Bipolar Disorder. (This \nis incorrect according to Dr. B Bipolar Disorder had to be ruled out.) LC administered \nassessments for anxiety and depression. His scores were nonsignificant in the \u201cnone-\nminimal\u201d range. She also reviewed the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar I, II, and Major \nDepressive Disorder. Of the three disorders, Applicant only \u201cendorsed 1 symptom of \nMajor Depressive Disorder (diminished ability to concentrate/think) and the diagnosis \nrequires 5 or more symptoms to be endorsed.\u201d (AE A) In LC\u2019s professional opinion, \nApplicant does not currently meet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar I \nor Bipolar II Disorders. (Tr. 34, 89-102; AE A) \nApplicant testified that he loved his first wife, despite their tumultuous relationship, \nwhich he attributed to her PTSD and trauma she experienced, along with her abuse of \nalcohol. The loss of custody of his stepdaughter had a devastating impact on him \nemotionally and mentally. When he learned his wife committed suicide, she had been \ndeceased for several weeks before her body was found. Although their marriage had \nfailed, she had been his best friend and he loved her. He could not understand why she \nwould not take her medication. (Tr. 29) \nApplicant remarried in 2023. He provided a letter from his new wife who is aware \nof the allegations in the SOR. She has known Applicant for four years. She has noticed \npositive changes in how he copes with his grief and loss. She noticed a substantial \nchange in the first year of knowing him and continued consistency in the three subsequent \nyears. She supports him in his goals.

(Tr. 47-49; AE G, J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant sought treatment from a mental health center \nfrom April 2017 to April 2018.

Seeking mental health treatment is not \na disqualifying condition. A suicidal ideation is not a suicide gesture or attempt. There are \nno disqualifying conditions that apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. I find for Applicant on these \nallegations. \nApplicant was admitted to a health center in approximately December 2018 via the \nBaker Act and diagnosed with depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, major \ndepressive disorder, single episode, unspecified, and unspecified depressive disorder. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and 28(c) apply. \nApplicant was diagnosed by a government-approved psychologist in January 2022 \nwith major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe in remission and cluster B personality \ntraits. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was diagnosed with Bipolar \nDisorder by Dr. B. He was not. Her diagnosis was reported as \u201cR/O Bipolar Disorder\u201d in \nthat Bipolar Disorder has to be ruled out, but it had not been yet. \nDr. B\u2019s report notes Applicant has cluster B personality traits. Although anecdotal, \nshe did not note a specific personality disorder as disqualifying as required under AG \u00b6 \n28(b). There were limited behavioral examples provided to help understand how Dr. B \narrived at her conclusions. Dr. B relied on historical data without providing context or an \nopportunity for Applicant to provide insight into factors that contributed to conflicting \ninformation. It appears that she did not consider that there may be another side to the \nstory. She failed to note the seriousness of the stressors he had while dealing with his ex-\nwife who was suffering from PTSD and alcohol issues and the loss of his stepdaughter. \nApplicant sought counseling and treatment to deal with his grief, which is exactly what is \nrecommended. She noted that his PAI was mildly elevated but did not provide the actual \nT-score and the fact that there may be other reasons a score could be elevated. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nSection 21 of the SF 86-Psychological and Emotional Health states: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe U.S. government recognizes the critical importance of mental health \nand advocates proactive management of mental health conditions to \nsupport the wellness and recovery of Federal employees and others. \nEveryday individuals with mental health conditions carry out their duties \nwithout presenting a security risk. While most individual with mental health \nconditions do not present security risks, there may be times when such a \ncondition can affect a person\u2019s eligibly for a security clearance. \nIndividuals experience a range of reactions to traumatic events. For \nexample, the death of a loved one, divorce, major injury, service in a military \ncombat environment, sexual assault, domestic violence, or other difficult \nwork-related, family, personal, or medical issues may lead to grief, \ndepression, or other responses. The government recognizes that mental \nhealth counseling and treatment may provide important support for those \nwho have experience such events, as well as for those with other mental \nhealth conditions. Nothing in this questionnaire is intended to discourage \nthose who might benefit from such treatment from seeking it. \nMental health treatment and counseling, in and of itself, is not a reason to \nrevoke or deny eligibility for access to classified information or folding a \nsensitive position, suitability or fitness to obtain or retain Federal or contract \nemployment, or eligibility for physical or logical access to federally \ncontrolled facilities or information systems. Seeking or receiving mental \nhealth care for personal wellness and recovery may contribute favorably to \ndecisions about your eligibility. \nApplicant recognized and voluntarily sought mental health counseling when he and \nhis first wife were having marital difficulties and they separated. He was the care provider \nfor her daughter for four months, until unexpectedly the police took her away in November \n2017. He experienced grief and depression. Although there are indications that he had \nsuicidal ideations, I found him credible that he did not intend to commit suicide, but he \nwas depressed. He continued in therapy and sought counseling and assistance from Dr. \nMC. They mutually decided he could discontinue therapy. He has shown great insight in \nseeking mental health counseling when he knew he needed it. He was understandably \ndepressed. As noted by Dr. B in January 2022, his condition, major depressive disorder, \nis in remission. \nIt has been four years since Applicant\u2019s first wife passed away. He is happily\nmarried and looking forward to his future. In June 2023, LC administered assessments\nfor anxiety and depression. His scores were nonsignificant in the \u201cnone-minimal\u201d range.\nShe also reviewed the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar I, II, and Major Depressive Disorder. Of \nthe three disorders, Applicant only \u201cendorsed 1 symptom of Major Depressive Disorder \n(diminished ability to concentrate/think) and the diagnosis requires 5 or more symptoms\nto be endorsed.\u201d In LC\u2019s professional opinion, Applicant does not currently meet the \ncriteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorders. I have \nconsidered Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis. I find Dr. MC and Applicant\u2019s mutual agreement that he no\n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlonger required therapy and LC\u2019s more recent evaluation and diagnosis as most \nprobative. I find the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. \nApplicant was arrested in August 2017 and July 2018 on charges of domestic \nviolence. The charges were later dropped. In September 2018 and May 2019, Applicant\u2019s \nfirst wife filed a domestic violence restraining orders against him. The orders were later \ndropped. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying trustworthiness concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMinimally these domestic violence charges were the result of mutual arguments, \nand the police were called and arrested Applicant. I found Applicant credible that the \ncharges of domestic violence and a domestic violence restraining order were the result \nof his ex-wife attempting to gain leverage regarding their pending divorce. Her failure to \nappear on all of the charges raises questions about their validity. In any event, a \nsignificant period of time has elapsed, and it happened under unique circumstances that \nare unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana three times over a weekend in January 2018. He \npurchased it in his state where it is legal. He held a security clearance at the time but did \nnot have access to classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. AG \u00b6 25(f) does \nnot apply because Applicant did not have access to classified information and insufficient \nevidence was provided to conclude he held a sensitive position at the time. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed on his SF 86 that he purchased and used marijuana \nover a weekend in January 2018. He explained he used it because he hoped it would \nhelp him relieve stress from his marital issues. Marijuana is not illegal under state law in \nthe state where he lived. He said he was unaware that it was a violation of federal law but \nadmitted he should have known better. He acknowledged his mistake and took \nresponsibility for his conduct. Applicant self-reported this conduct, and it is likely no one \nwould ever have discovered it, had he not disclosed it, as required, on his SF 86. I believe \nthis conduct was uncharacteristic of Applicant. It has been more than five years since it \nhappened, it happened under unique circumstances, and it is unlikely to recur. He \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from future misuse of any illegal drug. I \nfind the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines I, H, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s commitment to ensuring his mental health is a priority is evident in his \nconsistent awareness and voluntary treatment. He went through a difficult period, and he \nis now in a better place emotionally and mentally. He has the support of his new wife and \nhis family. He has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline I, psychological conditions, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

Applicant was terminated from a job in early 2010 for showing up \nfor work intoxicated. He voluntarily admitted himself into this two-month outpatient \nprogram. He fully complied with the conditions of the program. Appellant started drinking \nalcohol when he was in his forties. He started drinking more heavily in the 2007 to 2010 \nperiod. In the outpatient program, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent (Tr. at 15-16, \n28-29; GE 3 at 9, 25.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c September to October 2010 inpatient treatment for a condition \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependence. Applicant\u2019s marriage \u201cfell apart\u201d in 2010 when he and \nhis wife separated, and the stress following the breakup caused Applicant to relapse and \nstart drinking excessively again. He voluntarily admitted himself into a 30-day inpatient \ntreatment program.

Applicant had \nperiods of sobriety after his 2010 inpatient treatment. The longest was about 18 months. \nHe had several relapses. Sometimes he voluntarily entered an inpatient treatment \nprogram for about seven days, and on other occasions he decided to pursue outpatient \ntreatment. He stated that he was not taking his condition seriously and did not realize that \nhe had crossed the line between being a social drinker into being an alcoholic. He did not \nappreciate the seriousness of the disease of alcoholism. Applicant and his wife divorced \nin January 2014. (Tr. at 17; 32-33; GE 1, Sections 17, 24.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e May 2014 arrest and charges with DUI and Failure to Stop after an \nAccident. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Failure to Stop, as alleged in \nthe SOR. He denied, however, the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail. \nHe testified that after his arrest he was put in the \u201cdrunk tank\u201d overnight until he regained \nhis sobriety and then was released. The FBI report and the local sheriff\u2019s report in the \nrecord support the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail. He described the \nincident as a relapse and after drinking alcohol he drove to a store to buy groceries. He \nhad a minor accident and, due to the nature of the incident, he pulled his car into a parking \nspace to get his car off the road. The police treated his actions as a \u201chit and run.\u201d This \ncharge was eventually dropped. He testified that the accident was caused by the careless \ndriving of the other party involved, but Applicant took full responsibility for the accident \nbecause he was intoxicated. His BAC was 0.19%. He plead guilty to DUI and was \nsentenced to five years of probation. He believes that the reference in his criminal record \nto five days in jail may have been a suspended sentence. He was also sentenced to \nattend an 18-month alcohol education program. He fully complied with the terms of his \nsentence. He voluntarily entered an outpatient treatment program, as described in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, above.

He was discharged \nwith a diagnosis of Substance Abuse Disorder \u2013 Alcohol, Severe with a co-occurring \nmental disorder of Depression. He was given a guarded prognosis. After he left the \ntreatment facility in September 2017, he relocated to another city and lived in a shared \ncommunity home that was dedicated to alcohol-free living. He did well there until 2019 \nwhen he had a relapse and lost his job due to his failure to contact his supervisor and to \nshow up for work. (Tr. at 18-19, 42-50; GE 1, Section 24; GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 9; GE 7 at \n7-8.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g January to February 2021 inpatient treatment for conditions diagnosed \nas Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate or Severe) and Major Depressive Disorder (Single \nEpisode, Severe). Applicant had a \u201cshort relapse\u201d in January 2021. He voluntarily \nchecked himself into an inpatient program. He was intoxicated at the time, and his BAC \nmeasured at 0.183%. He only intended to stay long enough to detox. The SOR allegation \nstated that he left the treatment facility before completing his Continuing Recovery \nDischarge Plan. He explained that was true, but his early departure from the program was \nthe result of a misunderstanding. Due to his intoxicated condition at the time he entered \nthe program, he did not understand that he was expected to remain at the facility for 30 \ndays. He could not stay there for more than a brief period because that would have kept \nhim away from his new job. He stayed for about five days; long enough, in his view, to \nsafely detox from his condition. The treatment facility\u2019s discharge summary lists \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis on arrival was Alcohol Intoxication with moderate or severe use \ndisorder. The summary reflects that he made no progress in treatment and left the \nprogram before any planning could be done or any referrals provided. Applicant failed to \nlist this treatment in his February 5, 2021 e-QIP because he was tired of filling out the e-\nQIP and he felt that the treatment was not significant, rather it was just a \u201cquick detox.\u201d \n(Tr. at 19, 51-58, 66; GE 3 at 10; GE 6 at 1, 18.) \nThe last time Applicant drank alcohol was in July 2022. He purchased alcohol and \nconsumed it at his residence. He was not fully engaged in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) at \nthe time. He described his attendance at AA meetings prior to July 2022 as \u201cspotty.\u201d As \na result of his relapse, he was required to renew his sobriety date at AA. On May 26, \n2022, Applicant signed a statement \u201cunder penalty of perjury under the laws of the United \nStates that he intended to never drink alcohol again and never to drive after drinking. His \nstatement also expressed his understanding that \u201cany inappropriate involvement with \nalcohol use may be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d At the hearing \nin December 2022, Applicant strongly emphasized this he wants \u201cto lick this thing,\u201d \nreferring to his alcoholism, and to live an alcohol-free life.

Applicant did not separately respond to these allegations \nin his Answer. \nMitigation \nApplicant described his alcohol consumption, until he was about 45, as social.  He \nblames the beginning of his excessive drinking on his \u201cbad marriage.\u201d He was opposed \nto divorcing for religious reasons. Instead, he turned to alcohol. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he is an alcoholic. He now attends meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) most \nmornings, and he intends to continue to do so. He has a sponsor. Applicant believes that \nalcohol is a \u201ctricky disease,\u201d because it misleads you to believing that it is not a disease \nand is not a problem. It has taken him a long time to realize that he is an alcoholic and \nthat he needs to do whatever the AA program requires. He is actively involved in the AA \n12-step program. He is presently at Step 8. He intends to actively participate in AA for the \nrest of his life. He rents a room from an individual who is also in AA. They have an \nagreement that there will be no drinking of alcohol in the residence. Applicant explained \nthat he has now fully accepted his disease of alcoholism and treats his disease with AA \nand by seriously practicing his religious faith. He also receives counseling from the pastor \nat his church. He understands now that he can no longer turn to alcohol to help him deal \nwith stress in his life. After his last relapse he has a new sponsor. He speaks with the \nsponsor weekly. His prior sponsor lived too far from Applicant, and he recommended to \nApplicant that he should find a sponsor who lives near Applicant. (Tr. at 16-17, 19-24, 27, \n60-61; AE I.) \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor wrote in a character reference letter that he has known \nApplicant for about six years through their attendance at AA meetings. He praised \nApplicant for \u201creworking\u201d the 12 steps of AA. He commented that Applicant has held an \nadministrative position in his church and now has a similar position with a social club. \nApplicant also submitted four other character reference letters. His former sponsor, a \nformer neighbor, a former supervisor, and his church pastor all praised Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter and his dedication to maintaining sobriety. (AE C; AE I.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 lists six conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes all of the above disqualifying conditions, which \nshifts the burden of mitigation to Applicant. The following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23 have possible application: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been fully established. Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol abuse began in or about 2007, and he admittedly drank again as recently as July \n2022. It is too early to conclude that it will not recur. Accordingly, his behavior casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant has acknowledged his disease \nof alcoholism and his lengthy pattern of alcohol abuse and relapses. He has also provided \nevidence of his actions to overcome this problem. He has committed to participating \nregularly if not daily in AA and has a local sponsor and his pastor to support him on a \nregular basis. He has not, however, demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations and his own understanding \nthat he cannot drink alcohol with relapses into alcohol abuse. \nApplicant has participated in counseling and treatment programs on multiple \noccasions. However, he has an extensive history of relapses. Moreover, insufficient time \nhas passed to establish that he is making sufficient progress in his AA program. Applicant \nhas completed several treatment programs, but he has not yet been able to maintain \nsobriety for any significant period of time. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel argued in his summation that Applicant\u2019s long history of \nsuccessfully holding a security clearance and his honesty at the hearing about his \nstruggle with alcoholism should be the measure by which his case is adjudicated rather \nthan the potentially disqualifying conditions set forth in the Directive, quoted above. In \nessence, counsel argued that the disqualifying conditions in Guideline G do not provide \nthe appropriate guidance for analyzing the potential security risks raised by Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of alcoholism. (Tr. at 73-78.) The Appeal Board, however, has rejected challenges \nto the Adjudicative Guidelines as inappropriate policy. The Board ruled that it, and \ntherefore DOHA administrative judges, lack the jurisdiction to reject the application of the \nDirective\u2019s guidelines in a particular case.

Applicant\u2019s attorney made a \nsimilar argument in an appeal in 2010. The Appeal Board rejected that appeal argument \nin ISCR Case No. 09-02839 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2010). The Board commented that \ngiving an applicant special treatment not contemplated by Executive Order 10865 or the \nDirective \u201cwould have the practical effect of depriving other applicants of the fair, impartial \nand even-handed application of the law to which they are entitled.\u201d Id. It would indeed be \nunfair to not apply the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guideline G in this case \nin a fair, impartial and even-handed manner, just as those conditions are applied in every \nother case involving alcohol consumption under Guideline G. \nThe above precedents address and reject counsel\u2019s argument in favor of the \nrenewing Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. To the extent counsel overstated his \nargument and was merely seeking application of the whole-person concept as part of the \noverall considerations to be weighed, that issue is addressed below. \nApplicant has not carried his burden of mitigating the disqualifying security \nconcerns raised by the record evidence under Guideline G. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 27, which states: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) does not apply because the behavior alleged is covered under another \nguideline, i.e., Guideline G. The other two potentially disqualifying conditions have some \napplication to the facts in this case, though the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior are more properly analyzed under Guideline G, as discussed above. In light of \nthe Government\u2019s election to proceed under Guideline I as well as Guideline G, I conclude \nthat the record evidence supports the application of AG \u00b6 28(c) and 28(d), which shifts \nthe burden of mitigation to Applicant. The following mitigating conditions are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have application in this case. largely for \nreasons similar to those set forth under Guideline G, above. Applicant has not carried his \nburden of mitigation under Guideline I. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G and Guideline I and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-\nperson analysis. For many years, Applicant has been in and out of treatment for his abuse \nof alcohol. It is only since his most recent relapse in July 2022 that he has concluded that \nhis use of alcohol was ruining his life, his health, and potentially his career. On May 26, \n2022, the day he answered the SOR, he made a written commitment to abstain from \nusing alcohol and expressed his understanding that \u201cany inappropriate involvement with \nalcohol use may be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d. Two months \nlater he did just that. I credit Applicant\u2019s years of holding a security clearance without a \nsecurity incident or violation. I also credit Applicant\u2019s honest statement that he truly \nintends to live soberly for the rest of his life. But as he acknowledges, his disease of \nalcoholism is \u201ctricky,\u201d and it has been very difficult for him to control it. He has not had a \nsufficient period of sobriety to evidence that he can successfully control his disease and \nlive an alcohol-free life. In the absence of evidence of a lengthy period of sobriety, I cannot \nconclude that he no longer presents a security risk under the Adjudicative Guidelines. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately May 2016 to December 2018 and that he used marijuana in about October 2020 while granted access to classified information. He admits each of these allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his February 26, 2021, e-QIP by intentionally failing to disclose his marijuana use in about October 2020; by intentionally failing to disclose his 2020 marijuana while possessing a security clearance; and that he falsified his October 1, 2019, e-QIP by intentionally failing to disclose his marijuana use from approximately May 2016 to December 2018.

O\u2019Reilley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Anita Gorecki-Robbins, Esq. \n10/02/2023 \nDecision \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the Guideline E (Personal Conduct) security concerns \nraised by his intentionally false statements during his 2021 and 2019 background \ninvestigations. He has also failed to mitigate the and Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) security concerns raised by his recent marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 26, 2021. \nOn April 27, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines E and H. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended; and the adjudicative \nguidelines effective (AG) June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR requested a decision on the record without a hearing. \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case and on August 12, 2022, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaterial (FORM), which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4. Upon receipt of \nthe FORM, Applicant elected to retain counsel and requested that his case be converted \nto an in-person hearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel entered her appearance on September 6, \n2022, and reaffirmed Applicant\u2019s request for an in-person hearing. On September 8, 2022, \nDepartment Counsel submitted a memorandum to the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals\u2019 (DOHA) administrative department requesting that the FORM be converted to a \nhearing.  \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on September 12, 2022, and the case \nwas assigned to me on April 27, 2023. On June 21, 2023, DOHA notified Applicant that \nthe hearing was scheduled for July 20, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 27, 2023. \nProcedural Issue \nOn September 12, 2022, Department Counsel amended the SOR to include \u00b6 2.c, \nwhich alleges that Applicant falsified his October 2019 e-QIP by failing disclose his \nmarijuana use within the past seven years. The amended SOR required Applicant to circle \neither \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d and initial beside his response. Applicant circled \u201cadmit.\u201d He also \nattached a response to the SOR and the amended SOR wherein he admitted the three \nGuideline E falsification allegations but denied that his failure to disclose the information \nwas intentional. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from approximately May 2016 to December 2018 and that he used marijuana \nin about October 2020 while granted access to classified information. He admits each of \nthese allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his February 26, 2021, \ne-QIP by intentionally failing to disclose his marijuana use in about October 2020; by \nintentionally failing to disclose his 2020 marijuana while possessing a security clearance; \nand that he falsified his October 1, 2019, e-QIP by intentionally failing to disclose his \nmarijuana use from approximately May 2016 to December 2018. \nApplicant, 26, is a senior information technology consultant currently employed by \na defense contractor since November 2019. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in May \n2019. (GX 3.)   \nApplicant completed his first e-QIP in 2019. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that \nasked if he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years. \nHe was granted a secret security clearance in November 2019. (GX 3; GX 4.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn his February 2021 e-QIP in response to the same question about his drug use \nin the last seven years, Applicant stated that he used THC (marijuana) \u201cless than three \ntimes in college\u201d and listed his dates of use as May 2016 (estimated) to December 2018. \nWhen asked to provide an explanation of why he did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture, Applicant stated \u201cI will/have not been using this drug prior to my initial employment \ndue to security clearance regulations that THC is an illegal substance per governmental \nlaw.\u201d (GX 1.) \nOn March 23, 2021, Applicant underwent a personal subject interview (PSI) as part \nof his background investigation. He verified the investigator\u2019s summary of the interview in \nresponse to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories on April 6, 2022. During his PSI, Applicant told the \ninvestigator the information on his February 2021 e-QIP was accurate except that he also \nused marijuana one more time in October 2020 while possessing a security clearance. \nHe stated that he did not know why he did not list this most recent use. He then stated he \n\u201cdid not report this most recent use to his organization because he did not know what the \nrepercussions would have on his job status.\u201d He further stated that he \u201cwasn\u2019t told what \nthe reporting requirements were and was therefore not sure if he would be required to \nreport his use to his organization.\u201d (GX 2.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his answer to the amended SOR, Applicant stated: \nIn 2019, I completed an e-QIP for my first professional job. It was the first \ntime I had applied for a security clearance. I did not disclose that I had used \nmarijuana between 2016 and 2018. . . . I blame my own omission on my \nignorance of the process as well as my failure to pay attention to detail when \ncompleting such forms. At the time, I did not fully understand the significant \nconsequences my actions could have on my future and my ability to \nprogress in my chosen field. I did not receive an in-brief at my new job \nexplaining the e-QIP process and the pitfalls. \nFrom 2016 to 2018, I was in my first few years of college, and I used \nmarijuana with friends. I was young and immature and not thinking about \nhow my decisions could negatively impact my future. The use was \ninfrequent and never resulted in anyone questioning my judgment, \ncharacter, or reliability. \nApplicant further stated, \u201cthe 2020 use was an outlier and not consistent with my \nbehavior and 2020.\u201d \nI was put in for a higher level fill out another e-QIP when I completed the e-\nQIP on February 26, 2021, I unintentionally omitted my use of marijuana in \nOctober 2020. . . . During my interview with the investigator, I realized I had \nomitted the 2020 use when completing the e-QIP and I reported it. I did so \nbecause my failure to include the information on the form was an oversight. \nIt was not intentional. . . . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated: \nAnd when it came to the marijuana section, I mean at the time I was right \nout of college, I was scared if I were to say yes or no. What does that mean \nif I were to get rejected? That\u2019s a huge impact on my job, right. So I think \nnot understanding the process and being truthful in your answers, no matter \nwhat that is if it\u2019s going to negatively impact you are not a thing that\u2019s really \nthe main thing. (Tr. 23.) \n \nSo during the time, so my interview, if I recall, was back in 2021. And during \nthe time, I was answering all the questions\u2026 And she asked if I recall doing \nmarijuana. Have I ever done it? And I was, like, yes. I have done it in 2016 \nand 2018, throughout college, very briefly, periodically. I was, again, I was \na college student. . . . I was very busy all the time, but I say I maybe did it \ntwice a year. (Tr. 24.) \n \nSo that\u2019s something that I, looking back on, if I were to go and resubmit the \nform again, no matter what I\u2019ve done, parking tickets, if I\u2019ve gotten arrested, \nyou have to put it on there. You can\u2019t lie about that. Because there\u2019s always \nways to find that out, whether it\u2019s in the court or if there sifting through your \nfriends. There\u2019s always ways to find things. So I think it\u2019s just the right thing \nto do, is just be honest and truthful. (Tr. 25.) \nDuring cross-examination, the following exchange occurred: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: When you completed your first e-QIP in October of \n2019, you did not disclose your marijuana use while in college. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And you\u2019re saying it\u2019s because you breezed \nthrough the form and missed the questions about that? \nAPPLICANT: Breezed through the form and then just being nervous about \nsubmitting the, well, if I were to say yes, I had smoked marijuana from 2016 \nto 2018 when I graduated, I would be scared of that. That was going to \nimpact my ability to obviously move from [my former state of residence], and \nstart a new life, and working in this field, so yes. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Okay. So you chose not to include that \ninformation, because you were concerned it would affect your chances of \ngetting a job? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. (Tr. 39.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nWhile holding a security clearance, Applicant used marijuana in October 2020 \nwhile attending a party: \nAPPLICANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: So even at the party, did you realize how stupid \nyou were? \nAPPLICANT: Yes. So admittedly I took a couple of hits of it, and I \nimmediately realized \u2013 and I jumped, what are you doing? Why are you\ndoing this? So I immediately removed myself from the situation. There was\n[sic] people that were around me that they were mutual friends or friends of \nfriends. And I was, like, why am I doing this? Like, if I were to get caught, or\nif somebody were to find out about this, that\u2019s not good. (Tr. 26.) \n \n \n \n \nWhen asked by Department Counsel if he was aware that holding a security \nclearance meant that he could not use marijuana or other illegal substances, Applicant \nstated, \u201cI  did understand that, to be honest, at the time. I did.\u201d (Tr. 42.)  \nThe following exchange regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his October 2020 \nmarijuana use while holding a security clearance on his 2021 e-QIP occurred during \ncross-examination: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And this form was filled out February 2021. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Approximately four months after you used \nmarijuana at the party. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: You did not list that marijuana use on this form. \nWhy not? \nAPPLICANT: Again, I\u2019d say it\u2019s negligence, the process, and being afraid of \nwhat the ramifications would be if I were to say yes on this occurrence in \nOctober that I did use marijuana for -- I did use marijuana.  \nSo again, like I\u2019ve said before, being not mature to the process, not \nunderstanding the ramifications I would have behind that if I were to submit \nfictitious or false information, or hide the information, what it would have on \nmy career. \nSo going back, if I were to go back, if I had the ability, I would say yes, \nabsolutely, I did do that. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause again, I think with the maturity and where I\u2019m at now in \nunderstanding the process, that is my due diligence, and that\u2019s the right \nthing to do. But that\u2019s my response, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So just so you understand, we want to know if \nyour omission of that fact was deliberate or intentional. And it sounds like it \nwas deliberate that you, on purpose left that information off of this form. Is \nthat correct? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So your claims of making mistakes, or being \nnegligent in filling out this form, aren't really accurate, then. \nAPPLICANT: I wouldn\u2019t say that. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Well, we discussed earlier, the first form you \nfilled out, the first clearance you filled out, you didn\u2019t list the information \nabout your college drug use, because you were afraid you would get the \nclearance. Is that right? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And then the second form you filled out, you \ndidn\u2019t list the fact that you used marijuana at a party while holding a \nclearance, because you were afraid of the consequences. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Is that right? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. That\u2019s correct. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So it was a willful omission, it wasn\u2019t just \nnegligence. Is that correct? \nAPPLICANT: No. It was willful, but to be honest, that\u2019s something I honestly \neven buried, because I wasn\u2019t there for an extended use of time using \nmarijuana. I literally, I buried it. And is that the right thing to do? No, of \ncourse not. But was it intentional to leave it off there, to answer your \nquestion, yes, I did intentionally leave it off there, off the form. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And do you understand why that\u2019s more \nsignificant to us than using marijuana three times in college? \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPLICANT: Yeah, absolutely. Because, I mean, while having a clearance, \nand if you\u2019re going to lie about that, I mean, that doesn\u2019t show\ntrustworthiness and that somebody who holds a clearance, like, what else\nam I going to lie about, right? So trust me, I completely understand that\nprocess now. So, yes, I understand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So why should we believe you now? \nAPPLICANT: Again, this is something that I have -- this has been sitting on \nme for over a year now, since this has gone down. And I think it goes back \nto my maturity of understanding the process and having more \nresponsibilities now. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the responsibility aspect of it and where I\u2019ve \ngrown professionally and maturity-wise. \nI think it\u2019s -- again, that was something that I should have disclosed, of \ncourse. But I did not. And that was just due to being afraid of the \nramifications and what\u2019s going to happen after that. So that\u2019s it. (Tr. 47-50.) \nApplicant stated in his PSI, in his answer to the amended SOR, and during his \ntestimony that he does not associate with people who use illegal drugs. (GX 2; Tr. 27.) \nApplicant started college in 2016 at a private then-college now university, in his \nhome state. In describing his college background during direct examination, Applicant \nstated:  \nBut, yeah, so during that four years, I played baseball in college. I took \naround 18 to 21 credit hours a semester because, obviously baseball, it\u2019s \nlike a full-time job itself. And then also I did have a full-time job to provide\nfor myself as well, because obviously being in college, I mean, I never got \na handout, right. (Tr. 15-16.) \n \nWhen asked by his attorney what year he graduated, Applicant stated, \n\u201c2019, May 2019.\u201d (Tr. 16.) \nThe following exchange occurred during cross-examination: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: What was your GPA [in college]? \nAPPLICANT: So my graduate GPA, I believe, was 3.5, 3.5 or 3.6. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Did you maintain a 3.5 GPA while playing \nbaseball all four years? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. (Tr. 38.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, on his 2019 and 2021 e-QIPs, Applicant listed his college attendance \ndates as August 2015 to May 2019 and answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to the question that \nasked whether or not he received a degree/diploma. Under the heading \u201cEDUCATION\u201d \nin the summary of Applicant\u2019s March 2021 PSI, it states that Applicant volunteered that \nhe attended the university he listed on his e-QIPs from August 2015 until May 2019, \u201cbut \nwas issued the bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2020.\u201d He told the investigator that he \nwas not sure why he listed this information incorrectly on his e-QIP. (GX 3; GX 1; GX 3.) \nUnder the heading \u201cDEVELOPED EDUCATION,\u201d the PSI summary states that \nApplicant volunteered that from June 2019 until December 2020 he attended an online\nuniversity. Applicant explained that he did not know why he did not list the additional \nuniversity. He explained that he took courses at the online university because they were \nless expensive. He then transferred the credits to his original University which issued his\nbachelor\u2019s degree. He completed his coursework online while working for his current \nemployer. Applicant\u2019s resume lists his education as having received a bachelor\u2019s degree \nfrom the original university he attended but does not list the date of graduation. (GX 2;\nAX D.) \n \n \n \nAbove the signature line on the e-QIPs that Applicant completed and signed in \n2019 and 2021 is a paragraph entitled \u201cCertification.\u201d The paragraph contains the \nfollowing language: \nMy statements on this form, and on any attachments to it, are true, \ncomplete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made \nin good faith. . . . I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on \nthis form can be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both (18 U.S.C. \n1001). I understand that intentionally withholding, misrepresenting, \nfalsifying, or including classified information may have a negative effect on \nmy security clearance, employment prospects, or job status, up to and \nincluding denial or revocation of my security clearance, or removal and \ndepartment from Federal service. \nThe chief executive officer, who also serves as the facility security officer at \nApplicant\u2019s place of employment, strongly supports Applicant\u2019s maintaining his security \nclearance, citing his exceptional performance in servicing the company\u2019s clients. In his \nletter of recommendation, he states: \nI have read the DOHA report and that [Applicant] made errors in his\nreporting; I understand the errors made and have counseled him on\nensuring that his documentation is accurate and timely. (AX A.) \n \n \nA vice president for over 13 years at Applicant\u2019s place of employment, who \nconsiders himself a close mentor to Applicant who has guided him throughout his \nprofessional career, also strongly recommends that Applicant maintain his security \nclearance.

(AX B.) \nApplicant\u2019s 2021 and 2022 annual performance reviews rated him as outstanding. \nSince he informed his employer about the issues with his security clearance, Applicant \nhas been assigned the tasks of conducting security awareness training and of assisting \nnew-hires in completing their e-QIPs. (AX E; Tr. 21-22.) \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e stated in her letter of recommendation that she and Applicant \nhave been together for eight years and were soon to be married. She describes Applicant \nas kind, considerate, thoughtful, and as a person who radiates care towards everyone he \nencounters. She describes their daily life together and their hope for a family in the future \nwhere they will fill their household with \u201chonesty, integrity, and fulfillment.\u201d (AX C.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following will normally result in an \nunfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \nAG \u00b6 17: Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(b): the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.

He simply cannot keep his story \nstraight. In his answer to the amended SOR, he stated that his omissions on both e-QIPs \nwere unintentional. He attributed his omissions on his 2019 e-QIP to his \u201cignorance of the \nimportance of the process\u201d and his \u201cfailure to pay attention to detail when completing such \nforms.\u201d \nHowever, in his testimony, Applicant stated that he intentionally failed to list his \n2016 to 2018 marijuana use on his 2019 e-QIP because he was afraid that he would not \nget the job for which he was applying. \nIn his answer to the amended SOR, Applicant stated that he unintentionally omitted \nhis October 2020 marijuana use while holding the security clearance on his February \n2021 e-QIP, emphasizing that his failure to include the information was an \u201coversight\u201d and \n\u201cnot intentional.\u201d \nDuring his March 2021 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he did not know \nwhy he failed to list his 2020 marijuana use on his e-QIP, but stated that he did not report \nthe use to his organization because he was concerned that it could have an impact on his \nemployment status. \nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated he lied on his 2021 e-QIP about using \nmarijuana while holding a clearance because he was scared about what would happen \nwith his job. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s statements regarding the frequency of his marijuana use \nfrom 2016 to 2018 are inconsistent. On his 2021 e-QIP, he stated that he used marijuana \nin college less than three times. Less than three times definitionally means one or two \ntimes. However, during his testimony, he said that for the three years he used marijuana \nin college, he used it once or twice a year. He then stated that he used marijuana a total \nof three times in college. \nApplicant\u2019s various statements about his October 2020 marijuana use while \nholding a security clearance and the reason for his failure to report it on his 2021 e-QIP \nare inconsistent and overall implausible. He asserted that the omission was an oversight \nand unintentional. He also stated that he had suppressed the memory of this incident and \ndid not remember it until his PSI in March 2021. I find this assertion to be unconvincing. \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s repeated inability to unequivocally state the frequency of his \nmarijuana use throughout the security clearance process raises doubts about his \ncredibility and candor. I find it implausible that Applicant used marijuana a total of four \ntimes in his life and cannot recall at least some of the details of each of the circumstances \nand arrive at an accurate count. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant made multiple references to his unfamiliarity with the security clearance \nprocess and lack of understanding of the potential impact that intentionally falsifying his \nresponses on a security clearance application could have on his ability to obtain or \nmaintain a security clearance. First, telling the truth is a fundamental tenet of our society\u2019s \ngeneral ethical framework. As a general rule, it is not acceptable to lie. After falsifying \nmaterial facts on his first e-QIP in October 2019, Applicant signed the document, thereby \ncertifying that his responses were true to the best of his knowledge under penalty of \nFederal law. The ramifications for intentionally providing false information on the e-QIP \nare set forth above the signature line in plain English. At his next opportunity to provide \nthe Government with accurate information for assessing his security worthiness, he opted \nto lie again. \nThroughout the security clearance adjudication process, Applicant failed to fully \naccept responsibility for his conduct. He first attributed his failure to tell the truth on not \npaying attention when completing the e-QIP and on his lack of understanding of the \nsecurity clearance process. When he ultimately admitted to intentionally falsifying his \nresponses in 2019 and 2021, he stated that he lied because he was concerned about the \nimpact his conduct would have on his career path. \nApplicant also made several statements while testifying that raise concerns about \nhis credibility and trustworthiness. He stated that he graduated from his original university \nin May 2019 and that he played baseball for the four years he attended that school. This \nis not what he told the investigator during his PSI and it is not the information that he \nprovided on his 2019 and 2021 e-QIPs. \nApplicant also stated that if he had it all to do over again, he would list any and all \nderogatory information as required on the e-QIP, regardless of whether he had parking \ntickets or had gotten arrested, stating, \u201cYou can\u2019t lie about that. \u201cBecause there\u2019s always \nways to find that out. . . .\u201d In describing the circumstances of his October 2020 marijuana \nuse and his recognition of his poor judgment at the time of use, his stated concerns were \nabout whether or not someone saw him using marijuana or if he got caught doing it. He \ndoes not demonstrate an understanding of his obligation to be honest and forthcoming \nand to conduct himself in a manner consistent with those granted access to classified or \nsensitive information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by the record evidence, establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n\u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed on notice of its security \nsignificance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, may be \nlacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd.

He was aware that his marijuana \nuse while holding a security clearance was a policy violation and illegal but chose to use \nit anyway. He then lied on his February 2021 e-QIP by failing to disclose his marijuana \nuse in October 2020. He also used marijuana at least three times between 2016 and \n2018.

His assertions that he no longer associates with people who use marijuana \ndo not mitigate his conduct. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f) apply. Applicant has not mitigated the \nGuideline H concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines H and E and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nconduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2007 to 2011. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and a master\u2019s degree in 2022. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 49; GE 1, 9; AE B, E, F) Applicant has a history of substance abuse, alcohol-related incidents, and criminal conduct. On several occasions between about July 2010 and January 2011, he used synthetic marijuana, commonly known as \u201cspice.\u201d It appears that the substance was not on the schedule of controlled substances at the time, but the military prohibited the use of any substance, other than alcohol or tobacco, for the purpose of altering mood or function. He received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in March 2011 for violating Article 92 of the UCMJ, in that he was \u201cderelict in the performance of [his] duties in that [he] willfully failed to refrain from using the substance commonly known as \u2018spice.\u2019\u201d He was reduced one pay grade, ordered to perform extra duty for 30 days, and forfeited $300.

Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the requested \ninformation. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since October 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. military \nfrom 2007 to 2011. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since he \nwas in the military. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and a master\u2019s degree in \n2022. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 49; GE 1, 9; \nAE B, E, F) \nApplicant has a history of substance abuse, alcohol-related incidents, and \ncriminal conduct. On several occasions between about July 2010 and January 2011, he \nused synthetic marijuana, commonly known as \u201cspice.\u201d It appears that the substance \nwas not on the schedule of controlled substances at the time, but the military prohibited \nthe use of any substance, other than alcohol or tobacco, for the purpose of altering \nmood or function. He received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) in March 2011 for violating Article 92 of the UCMJ, in \nthat he was \u201cderelict in the performance of [his] duties in that [he] willfully failed to \nrefrain from using the substance commonly known as \u2018spice.\u2019\u201d He was reduced one pay \ngrade, ordered to perform extra duty for 30 days, and forfeited $300. The forfeiture was \nsuspended. In May 2011, he was discharged for misconduct (drug abuse) with a \ngeneral under honorable conditions discharge. (Tr. at 24-29, 49-50; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 8, 9; AE F) \nApplicant testified that he consulted with an attorney before his Article 15 \npunishment and discharge. He stated that he \u201cwas under the impression that had [he] \nelected to talk to an attorney that it would have went down to a court. And [he] would not \nhave been able to get the general discharge.\u201d When he was informed that he initialed \nthe record of nonjudicial punishment proceedings indicating that he had consulted with \na lawyer, he stated that he did not recall seeing a judge advocate. (Tr. at 28-29; GE 8) \nApplicant was arrested in State A in December 2013 and charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI). The police report indicates that Applicant was drinking in a \nbar/restaurant, when he was refused further alcohol service because he was \nintoxicated. The business called a taxi, but he did not accept the taxi. The manager told \nApplicant that if he attempted to drive, the manager would call the police.

He \nrefused to participate in a field sobriety test, and he refused to provide a breath or blood \nsample. (Tr. at 30-32, 51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7) \nApplicant pleaded guilty or no contest. He may have received deferred \nsentencing in which he paid a fine and court costs, and he was on unsupervised \nprobation for a year. He testified that he did not have a good memory of what led to his \narrest, and he did not recall if he was intoxicated when he left the bar. (Tr. at 30-33, 51-\n53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7, 9) \nApplicant was arrested in March 2014 in State B and charged with public \ndrunkenness. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine of about $500. He does not remember \nmany details of what occurred other than it was outside his home. (Tr. at 33-36, 55-58; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6, 9) \nApplicant was drinking at a bar/restaurant in State C in March 2016. The staff \noffered him options for a safe ride home, but he refused. The staff called the police and \nreported that Applicant left the establishment, was possibly intoxicated, and intended to \ndrive home. The police arrived, and the staff pointed out Applicant, who was not far from \nhis car. The police officer noted clear signs that Applicant was intoxicated, and he was \nshoeless with mud around his legs up to his knees. There is a lake near the restaurant, \nand the officer deduced that Applicant walked into the lake despite the temperature \nbeing about 44 degrees. Applicant told the officer he was walking home, but he was \nwalking in the wrong direction. He stated that he did not have his car keys, but they \nwere found in his pocket. (Tr. at 37-40, 59-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 9) \nApplicant was arrested for the above incident and charged with public \nintoxication. He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and paid a fine of about $500. \n(Tr. at 37-39, 59-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 9) \nApplicant provided inconsistent testimony about the incident. He initially testified: \nI went to another bar late at night alone, by myself. And I drank too much, \nto excess. And I didn\u2019t want to drive home because I knew I had too much \nto drink so I attempted to walk home.  \nThis is when the officer, officer stopped me when I was walking home. He \nperformed a field sobriety test and determined I was intoxicated in public. \n(Tr. at 37) \nTwo questions later, he answered that he could not recall if he was intoxicated when he \nleft the restaurant. He also stated that he could not recall if he walked in the lake.

The waitress cut him off and tried to take his keys. At least one person \ncalled the police at about 0210 and reported that a car hit a curb, and the driver \n(Applicant) was standing in the middle of the street and appeared to be intoxicated. \nApplicant was extremely intoxicated. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was \nmeasured at .279%. (Tr. at 40-41, 61-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 9) \nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) with a \nblood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .15% or greater. In February 2017, he pleaded \nguilty to the lesser charge of DWI. He was sentenced to fines and court fees of $1,600, \nconfinement in the county jail for 180 days (suspended for 180 days), and probation for \none year. Applicant stated that he thought it was a deferred adjudication, but there is \nnothing in the court records to corroborate that assertion. (Tr. at 40-41, 61-63; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 9) \nIn January 2020, police responded to a report that two individuals were fighting in \nthe parking lot of a bar in State C at about 2346. Applicant was found on the ground. \nThe other individual (described by Applicant as an acquaintance) forcibly stopped \nApplicant from driving home. Applicant admitted to the police officer that he had \u201ca lot\u201d \nto drink, he was intoxicated, and he planned to drive home until he was stopped by the \nother individual. Applicant admitted in his response to the SOR that he was drinking that \nnight, but he \u201cwas not binge drinking or drinking to excess.\u201d (Tr. at 42-44, 65-67; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 9) \nApplicant was arrested for the above incident and charged with public \nintoxication. He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and paid a fine of about $350. \nHe has little memory of the incident. (Tr. at 42-44, 65-67; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 2, 9) \nApplicant admitted that he had drinking issues, but he does not believe he is an \nalcoholic, and he does not believe that he currently has a drinking problem. He stated \nthat, except for his use of spice in the military, he has never used illegal drugs. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he indicated that \u201cit was in his best interest to refrain from alcohol \nconsumption entirely.\u201d He signed a statement of intent in August 2022 stating that he \ndiscontinued drinking, and that he intended \u201cto abstain from alcohol use in the future.\u201d \nHe has maintained his \u201csobriety,\u201d which he described as not drinking to intoxication, for \nmore than a year. The last time he had anything to drink was in May 2023 when he had \nthree beers with his father at a baseball game. He is fitness oriented and goes to the \ngym about five times a week. He is attending graduate school in pursuit of another \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Tr. at 18-21, 27, 46-51, 69-73; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, I, \nJ, L-P) \nI did not find Applicant credible. I find that the reports into his conduct are more \nreliable than Applicant, and that he committed the conduct alleged in the reports. \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI or DWI in 2013 and 2017. He was arrested or \ncited for public drunkenness or public intoxication in 2014, 2016, and February 2020. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a troubled history with alcohol. He has two alcohol-related driving \noffenses. He refused assistance from his friend and the staff at the bar on two other \noccasions, and apparently would have driven if not arrested by the police. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he indicated that \u201cit was in his best interest to refrain from alcohol \nconsumption entirely.\u201d He signed a statement of intent in August 2022 stating that he \ndiscontinued drinking, and that he intended \u201cto abstain from alcohol use in the future.\u201d \nHe testified that he has maintained his \u201csobriety,\u201d which he described as not drinking to \nintoxication, for more than a year. The last time he had anything to drink was in May \n2023 when he had three beers with his father at a baseball game. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated misconduct is serious. It would be difficult to find it mitigated even if I believed \nhim. I do not. \nI have concerns about Applicant\u2019s drinking and the extremely poor judgment he \nexhibited while drinking. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficiently applicable to \novercome concerns about Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand honesty. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used synthetic marijuana, commonly known as \u201cspice,\u201d in about 2010. \nIt appears that the substance was not on the schedule of controlled substances at the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \ntime, but the military prohibited the use of any substance, other than alcohol or tobacco. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nApplicant held a security clearance at the time, but I do not find substantial \nevidence that the use was while granted access to classified information. AG \u00b6 25(g) is \nnot applicable. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) for a \ndiscussion on the distinction between holding a security clearance and having access to \nclassified information. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThis was Applicant\u2019s only drug involvement and it occurred more than 12 years \nago. I find that he has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that \nillegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges \nthat he was separated from the military \u201cfor misconduct (drug abuse),\u201d and his \u201cservice \nwas characterized as General, Under Honorable Conditions.\u201d His discharge does not \nraise any criminal conduct disqualifying conditions, but his illegal drug abuse does. AG \n\u00b6 31(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe analysis under alcohol consumption applies equally here. While I found his \ndrug abuse mitigated under Guideline H because I do not believe he will use illegal \ndrugs again, it falls into his pattern of substance abuse and disregard for the law. \nAdditionally, I do not believe his testimony. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, including his \nillegal drug abuse, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above \nmitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline H, but he did not mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guidelines G and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on July 5, 2022, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2023. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on May 5, 2023, \nscheduling the matter for a video teleconference (VTC) hearing on June 13, 2023.  \nI convened the hearing as scheduled.

The SOR allegations are \nestablished by his admissions in his Answer; his June 2020 security clearance application \n(SCA); his July 2021 response to financial interrogatories; and credit bureau reports from \nAugust 2020 and March 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 24-32; GE 1-4)  \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to his periods of unemployment and \nminimal income. In around 2007, he used the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c to pay for \n$40,000 of training to be a real estate investor. The training taught him \u201chow to flip \nproperties and buy and hold wholesale . . . .\u201d He made monthly payments on the credit \ncards until he became unemployed. He also used the credit cards to pay for his family\u2019s  \ndaily living expenses when he was unemployed. During his periods of unemployment, his \nspouse also worked only part time. (Tr. at 24-32, 35-39, 44-47; GE 1-2) \nApplicant contacted each of the creditors when he lost his job in 2016. He \nattempted to lower his monthly payments until he was re-employed, but the creditors \ndenied his request. When the creditors later offered him lower monthly payments, he was \nstill unemployed. When employed, he earned approximately $50,000 annually from 2012 \nto 2017; $70,000 annually from 2017 to 2019; $55,000 annually from 2019 to 2020; and \n$87,000 annually since March 2020. His spouse, who has worked full time as a dental \nhygienist since 2018, earned $60,000 annually. (Tr. at 24-32, 35-39, 44-46, 52-54; GE 1-\n2) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not made any payments toward the \nSOR debts. He had to pay for two other credit cards, and he also paid approximately \n$15,000 total in taxes to the IRS from around 2017 to 2020. As of the date of the hearing, \nhe did not owe delinquent taxes to the IRS. He and his spouse also took out two loans in \n2021, totaling $38,000, to renovate their home. His monthly payments for the loans were \n$756 and $275, respectively. Once he paid these loans, he intended to pay the SOR \ndebts.

After paying their monthly household expenses, which included their $2,053 \nmortgage and the $1,031 payment toward their two loans, he estimated that they had a \nmonthly net remainder of $400. His budget did not include payments to any of the SOR \ndebts. He has not received credit counseling. A June 2023 credit report reflects that he \ndoes not have any delinquent debts. (Tr. at 49-52; GE 2, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. While Applicant intends to resolve the \nSOR debts, he had not yet taken any steps toward doing so as of the date of the hearing. \nHe has not received financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has \nhis finances under control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She was unemployed from April to June \n2021. She was hired by her current employer as a property analyst in March 2022. She \ncurrently is a part-time employee. She has never held a security clearance. (Tr. 5-6) \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor vouched for her performance as a property \nmanagement analyst. Her supervisor noted that she \u201cexhibited high levels of \nprofessionalism, attention to detail, and dependability.\u201d When the issue regarding her \nsecurity clearance arose, her employer retained her as a part-time employee so that she \ncould return to full-time employment if her application for a security clearance was \ngranted. (Tr. 5-6; AX B; AX J) With the approval of her employer, Applicant also works \npart-time for a non-federal employer. (Tr. 33; AX I.) \nApplicant has some college credits but has not received a degree. She married in \nDecember 2013, divorced in May 2016, married in May 2017, and separated in October \n2020.

She has a 90% \nservice-connected disability based on post-traumatic stress disorder and a work-related \nconcussion. (Tr. 29-30) In her SCA, she characterized the basis for her discharge as \u201cleft \nby mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct\u201d and she identified \nthe allegations as a \u201cpattern of misconduct.\u201d (GX 1 at 17) \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts that are reflected in credit reports from \nNovember 2020 (GX 5), July 2021 (GX 6), January 2022 (GX 7), and May 2023 (GX 8). \nThe evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: car loan charged off for $13,643.

She borrowed money from her credit union \nto finance the purchase. While she was training in a remote area, she allowed another \nsoldier to use the car. The other soldier entered his own name on the title, registered the \ncar in his name, and obtained a loan from a title-loan company. When he failed to make\nthe payments, the car was repossessed by the title-loan company. (Tr. 34-40) On March\n29, 2023, the credit union agreed to settle Applicant\u2019s debt for $4,457.46, to be paid by\n36 monthly payments of $151.60 each.

She was a senior in high school at the time. She testified that she \nwas with a group of girls, one of the girls had marijuana in a bag, and she was the only \none who was arrested because she was the only one who was 18 years old. She \nperformed eight hours of community service, and the charges were disposed of by nolle \nprosequi. (GX 3; Tr. 49-50) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SCA, she disclosed that she was discharged from \nthe Army because of a pattern of misconduct. (GX 1 at 19) When she was interviewed by \na security investigator, she acknowledged that she received nonjudicial punishment and \nwas reduced in rank because of multiple incidents of being late for duty and disobeying \norders. (GX 2 at 6) At the hearing, she admitted receiving nonjudicial punishment for \nbeing late for duty, but she could not remember the details. (Tr. 51) The record does not \ncontain any documentation of the action other than Appellant\u2019s disclosure in her SCA. \nThe disciplinary action is alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c comingles several incidents that resulted in Applicant\u2019s discharge from \nthe Army. A security investigator questioned Applicant about several incidents recited in \na memorandum recommending that she be discharged. (GX 2) The memorandum was \nnot included in the record, but the investigator\u2019s questioning reflects the following \nincidents: \nFirst, Applicant was punished by her company commander for multiple military \nviolations, such as being late for duty, missing formations, and wearing improper insignia \non her uniform. \nSecond, Applicant was accused of impersonating a noncommisioned officer. She \nwas talking with a loan officer about an overdue payment, and she gave her platoon \nsergeant\u2019s name as a person who could verify that she was late making the payment \nbecause she was sick. When the loan officer called again, she thought she was talking to \nthe platoon sergeant. No disciplinary action was imposed for this incident, but it was \nincluded in the list of incidents recited as a basis for discharging Applicant from the Army. \nThird, Applicant was involved in the use of a rental car that resulted in her being \ncharged with wrongful appropriation of the car and making a false official statement. \nAccording to the law enforcement report, a former sergeant had rented a vehicle in May \n2015, and he left the vehicle with Applicant when he was separated from the Army. The \nrisk manager for the car rental agency told law enforcement authorities that she had \ncontacted Applicant several times and that Applicant had agreed to return the vehicle. \nThe rental agency they reported the vehicle as stolen when it was not returned. Applicant \nclaimed that she gave the former sergeant money to extend the rental period, but he \ndenied receiving any money from her. She knew that the return of the vehicle was overdue \nby about five weeks, but she denied being contacted by the rental agency. She told the \nlaw enforcement investigators that her cellphone was not working and that she did not \nreceive any email from the rental agency.

Applicant testified that she did not disclose the April \n2012 marijuana incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a because she had been told that it would be \nexpunged. She denied intentionally falsifying her SCA or intentionally failing to disclose \ninformation to the security investigator, but she admitted that she was careless when she \ndid not fully disclose the basis of her discharge from the Army. (Tr. 64-65.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).

Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. The delinquent car loan was the result of \nfraudulent conduct, which was a condition largely beyond her control. Her marital \nseparation was largely beyond her control. Her unemployment was not largely beyond \nher control, but was due to her repeated misconduct. She has acted responsibly regarding \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.j, which she has resolved. She has not acted \nresponsibly regarding the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, for which she has negotiated a \nsettlement but has not made any payments. She claimed that she settled the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.j, but she submitted no evidence supporting her claim. She \nsubmitted no evidence of responsible conduct regarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, \n1.g, and 1.h. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established, because Applicant sought and received \nfinancial counseling at a family assistance center at the military installation where she \nwas employed. However, she has not yet reached the point where there are \u201cclear \nindications\u201d that the financial problems are being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.d and 1.j. It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and 1.j, because she has not submitted \nany evidence supporting her claim that these debts were resolved. When an applicant \nclaims that a debt is resolved, he or she is expected to present documentary evidence \nsupporting that claim. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). This \nmitigating condition is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, \nbecause Applicant admitted that she had done nothing to resolve these debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and \ncandid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established for Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that she had been \ncharged with possession of marijuana in April 2012.

See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant did not correct the omissions until she was \nconfronted with the facts. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s arrest for possession of marijuana in April \n2012, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. which is mitigated by the passage of time without recurrence. \nIt is not established for the military disciplinary offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b or the \nfraudulent conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. The offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b are almost \nten years old, but they were the beginning of a long record of inability or unwillingness to \nfollow rules and regulations that continued until Applicant was discharged from the Army. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for the falsifications during the security-clearance \nadjudication process, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.f, because they are not \u201cminor.\u201d The \ngovernment has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified \ninformation. That compelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in \nbeing able to make sound decisions, based on complete and accurate information, about \nwho will be granted access to classified information.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her delinquent debts and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                 \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and requested a hearing. This case \nwas assigned to me on December 20, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for February 21, \n2023, via Microsoft Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard on the scheduled \ndate. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and nine exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on March 2, 2023. \n Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly (a) misused his company \ncredit card in September 2018 for personal use, was confronted by his employer with \nallegations of misconduct, and left by mutual agreement and (b) accumulated 13 \ndelinquent consumer debts exceeding $61,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been \nresolved. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted (a) some of the alleged SOR \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.m-1.n) with explanations. He claimed he misused \nhis company credit card to include his family members on a company business trip and \nwas not allowed to repay the expenditures before leaving his employment by personal \nagreement. He also claimed he could not pay his listed consumer debts for lack of \nmoney after losing his job. \nAddressing his student loan debts, he claimed he became unable to continue \npaying on his student loan accounts after he lost his job in 2018. He further claimed his \nDepartment of Education (DoE) loans are currently in deferment and attached a credit \nreport. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in May 2010 and has three children from this marriage (ages \nsix, eight, and nine). (GE 1; Tr. 28) He earned a high school diploma in May 2006. He \nearned an associates degree in May 2008 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2014. \n(GE 1) He reported no military service, and he has never held a security clearance. \nSince August 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nfull-time shop mechanic. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 25-27) Between September 2012 and September \n2018, he worked for a railroad as a truck driver mechanic. This job required a \nconsiderable amount of travel, and he left this job by mutual agreement in September \n2018. (GEs 1-2) Previously, Applicant worked for other employers in various jobs. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2016 and 2021, Applicant accumulated delinquent medical and \nconsumer accounts exceeding $61,000. (GEs 2-4) Included SOR debts are as follows: \n1.b (a co-signed delinquent auto loan for $16,228); 1.c, 1.e-1.f,  and 1.h-1.l (delinquent \nstudent loans exceeding $18,000); 1.d (a delinquent credit card debt for $5,611); 1.g (a \ndelinquent consumer debt for $2,124); 1.m (a delinquent utility debt for $118); and 1.n \n(a delinquent car loan for $21,111). Applicant attributed these debts to insufficient \nresources to address his debts following his separation from his job in September 2018.  \nBefore he was forced to leave his railroad job by mutual agreement in 2018, \nApplicant was charged with using his company credit card to purchase a hotel room for \nhis wife and family. (GEs 1-2\u2019 Tr. 31) Having invited his wife and family to accompany \nhim on a business trip, he booked a hotel upgrade to accommodate his wife and family \nand used his company travel card to rent the hotel room for the July 4th  weekend. (GEs \n1-2; Tr. 28-31)  \nOnce Applicant\u2019s company learned of his using his company travel card to \naccommodate his family while on company travel, it opened an internal investigation \ninto the matter. (GEs 1-2) After confirming the facts of the reported incident, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer came to an agreement with him in September 2018 to separate from the \ncompany by mutual agreement. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 28-29, 32) Applicant\u2019s offer to repay the \nmoney he used to obtain an upgrade of his hotel room was declined by his employer. \n(GE 2; Tr. 29) \nWithout comparable income to address his accrued debts following his \nunplanned 2018 employment separation, Applicant encountered difficulties paying his \ndebts and was unable to prevent his defaulting on them. Two of the delinquent debts \ninvolved deficient balances on vehicles purchased in 2020. Both of these accounts \nremain unpaid and unresolved. (Tr. 33-34, 41-42) \nOther delinquent accounts belonging to Applicant include his DoE student debts \n(opened between 2010 and 2014). While these delinquent loans have been in \ndeferment for the past two years, they were in delinquent status before they were \nplaced in deferment. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 50-51) Records document eight separate student \nloans that were placed in collection in October 2020 prior to being placed in deferment \nstatus. (GE 2) After losing his job, Applicant became unable to continue making his \nscheduled monthly payments. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining creditors have not been addressed with any documented \npayments. SOR creditor 1.d obtained a stipulated judgment against Applicant in August \n2022 in the amount of $6,052. (AE D) As a part of Applicant\u2019s settlement agreement \nwith the creditor to forebear collection on the judgment, Applicant agreed to make \nmonthly payments of $52.86, beginning in August 2022. (AE E) Agreed monthly \npayments in compliance with his settlement agreement are not documented, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges no more than $500 in payments have been paid to date on this \naccount. (AEs C-E; Tr. 36) \nNeither of his three delinquent accounts with SOR creditors 1.b, 1.g, and 1.n \nhave been addressed, and they remain unresolved and outstanding. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 39-\n42)   Although his agreement with SOR creditor 1.m to pay off the $118 utility debt owed \nto this creditor\u2019s collection agent is not documented, Applicant\u2019s payment assurances \nconcerning this small debt are credible, corroborated in part by its deletion from his  \nmost recent credit report, and are accepted. (AE H; Tr. 40)  \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation remains poor. (GE 2) To date, he has been limited \nin his ability to manage his debts, and he has not had the monetary resources to \naddress his delinquent accounts. (GE 2) His current plans consist of saving up enough \nmoney to pay off his debts. (GE 2; Tr. 25) \nCurrently, Applicant has a salary of $29.80 an hour and has about $100 in \nremaining discretionary funds after his monthly expenses are satisfied. He has never \nreceived financial counseling and has no formal budget. (Tr. 36). Essentially, he lives \npaycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 43) In the meantime, he continues to look for higher paying \njobs that will enable him to make meaningful progress with his delinquent accounts. \nApplicant cited a tentative offer made to him in July 2022 that if accepted and \nemployed will pay him $260 per day. (AE F) At this time, however, nothing has been \nfinalized between Applicant and this prospective employer. (H-L) \nEndorsements \nApplicant\u2019s group manager who has known Applicant for almost 18 months \nexpressed surprise to hear about Applicant\u2019s financial situation. He credited Applicant \nwith being a model employee since he started with their company. (AE A) His group \nmanager characterized him as a person \u201cof upright character and integrity in the \nworkplace.\u201d (AE A) This group manager also credited him with being an \u201cupstanding \nmember of the community.\u201d (AE A) And, his group manager expressed strong support \nfor Applicant\u2019s willingness to accept responsibility for his actions. \nCoworkers and friends credit Applicant with being hardworking, meticulous, \ntrustworthy, and professional. (AE A) They characterize him as a person who can be \ncounted on, and one who is very eager to help others. \n Policies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14;\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted misuse of his company\ncredit card is fully documented and create judgment issues as well over the\nmanagement of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).\nAlthough he qualified his admissions with explanations, his admissions can be weighed\nalong with other evidence developed during the hearing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited 2018 job loss and income limitations on his ability to address his \nSOR debts played some role in his accrual of so many delinquent debts over the past \nfew years. Considering these added financial burdens associated with his losing his job, \nmitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nOne minor utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m) associated with Applicant\u2019s SOR accounts \nhas been satisfied and resolved by Applicant with a credited payoff. For this resolved \naccount, application of 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d bears partial application to \nApplicant\u2019s (albeit quite limited) financial situation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \nIn addressing his remaining debt delinquencies, Applicant has been less \nsuccessful. Afforded hearing and post-hearing opportunities to address his still \nunresolved accounts, Applicant has been unable to make any material progress in \naddressing his still unresolved debts. Without more payment documentation on \nApplicant\u2019s settled accounts, these accounts still reflect unfulfilled promises to pay off \nthe agreed settlement amounts in the future with his hopes of finding a more \nremunerative job. Resolution of Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies remains a work in \nprogress that will require more time and effort from Applicant. While Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent student loans remain in deferment status, at some point in the future when \nthe enforcement pause is lifted, Applicant will need a well-developed plan to address his \nstudent loans. With the limited resources he currently has at his disposal, considerable \ndoubts remain as to how he will be able to raise enough funds to rehabilitate his student \nloans. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance. Payment agreements \nalone that are not accompanied by material good-faith payments still reflect promises to \npay that do not meet the good-faith payment requirements of MC 20(d). \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and \nhis explanations of his one-time misuse of his company\u2019s credit card and the delinquent \ndebts attributed to him in the SOR, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable \nhim to maintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding \na security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

He \nreceived the FORM on September 13, 2022, and did not respond. The case was assigned \nto me on August 16, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \ndenied the allegation in SOR 1.b. His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in August \n1996 and has four children, ages 15, 16, 23, and 24. He served on active duty in the U.S. \nArmy from September 1990 until he retired on a date not reflected in the record. He \nreceived a security clearance around 1994. (FORM Item 1 at 34) He submitted a security \nclearance application in April 2013, and his clearance was revalidated in July 2014. His \nclearance was apparently carried over when he began working for a defense contractor \non a date not reflected in the record. \nIn April 2021, the DOD Continuous Vetting Program discovered the two debts \nalleged in the SOR and reflected in a credit report from April 2021. (Form Item 6)  SOR \u00b6 \n1.a alleges a home mortgage loan that is past due for $82,044, with a total loan balance \nof $261,516. The last payment on the debt was in November 2020. (FORM Items 4 and \n6) Applicant purchased the home in April 2005. When he was reassigned to another \nlocation, he was unable to sell the house because of market conditions, and he decided \nto rent it. In August 2017, a broken water pipe on the second floor of the house severely \ndamaged the house and made it unhabitable. As a result, his tenants moved out and his \nrental income stopped, making it impossible for him to make the payments on the rental \nproperty as well as his current residence. Using $25,000 from his insurance company, he \nhired a contractor to repair the home, but the contractor did not finish the job. Applicant \nobtained a second mortgage loan to hire a new contractor, who completed the repairs. \nHe remained in contact with the primary mortgage lender, who advised him to sell the \nproperty. He attached a sales contract to his answer to the SOR, signed by the parties on \nApril 27, 2022, reflecting an agreement to buy the home for $279,900, which is more than \nsufficient to pay the debt. (FORM Item 2 at 3) However, the record does not contain \nevidence of a final sale and resolution of the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a cellphone account charged off for $529. Applicant contracted \nfor cellphone service while he was stationed overseas. In his answer to the SOR, he \ndenied the debt on the ground that the sales agent told him he could terminate the \ncontract if he was reassigned back to the United States. He did not provide any \ndocumentation of a contract with a provision for termination due to military orders. He \nclaimed that he disputed this debt, but he provided no documentation of the dispute. \nHowever, he provided documentation that he paid the debt in full on May 4, 2022.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s debts are infrequent and were incurred \nunder circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The damage to \nApplicant\u2019s home, the non-performance by a contractor, and the depressed real estate \nmarket were conditions largely beyond his control. He acted responsibly by repairing his \nhome, staying in contact with the mortgage loan lender, and following the advice of the \nlender by selling his home for an amount that was more than sufficient to pay the debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant submitted \nno evidence of predatory marketing by the sales agent for the cellphone service. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant maintained \ncontact with his mortgage lender, found a buyer, and negotiated a contract for enough \nmoney to satisfy the debt. The failure of Applicant to submit evidence that the sale was \ncompleted does not preclude mitigation. An applicant is not required to be debt-free. \n\u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly given his circumstances \nand develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). Applicant\u2019s evidence reflects a reasonable plan \nand concomitant conduct. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is also established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. It is well \nestablished that an applicant who waits until his or her clearance is in jeopardy before \nresolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). However, in this case, \nApplicant believed that he was misled by a sales agent. It is not uncommon for military \nmembers to be confronted with an unexpected termination fee for telecommunications \nand other services when they are reassigned. Applicant\u2019s explanation for his delayed \npayment of the debt was plausible and credible. When he was unable to successfully \ndispute the debt, he paid it. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not fully established. Applicant articulated a reasonable basis for \ndisputing the cellphone debt, but he failed to provide documentary evidence of his efforts \nto dispute it. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). However, I have noted that Applicant has held a security clearance \nsince 2007, apparently without incident until the two debts alleged in the SOR were \ndiscovered. Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that he pays his bills on time. The two debts \nalleged in the SOR arose under unusual circumstances, and Applicant has responsibly \naddressed them. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by the two debts alleged in the SOR. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked for this contractor or a predecessor thereof since January 2012. He was married from 1984 until a divorce in 2018. He has three adult children, one of whom resides with him. He earned a high school diploma in 1974 and took a semester of college courses but did not earn an undergraduate degree.

(Tr. 15-22, 29-32; GE 1, 3) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2019, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that he is indebted to the federal government for at least $20,000 for delinquent income taxes for tax years 2013 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He admitted the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are established through his admissions and the Government\u2019s exhibits. (SOR; Answer, GE 1-3) Applicant could not confirm whether his 2013 through 2019 federal income tax returns have been filed. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he had filed them. In March 2021, he hired a professional tax company (TC) to file his delinquent income tax returns. He paid them $10,000.

(Tr. 15-22, 29-32; GE 1, 3) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2019, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also \nalleged that he is indebted to the federal government for at least $20,000 for delinquent \nincome taxes for tax years 2013 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He admitted the SOR \nallegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are \nestablished through his admissions and the Government\u2019s exhibits. (SOR; Answer, GE \n1-3) \nApplicant could not confirm whether his 2013 through 2019 federal income tax \nreturns have been filed. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he had filed \nthem. In March 2021, he hired a professional tax company (TC) to file his delinquent \nincome tax returns. He paid them $10,000. He claimed that he signed a power of \nattorney to allow the TC to sign income tax returns on his behalf, but he did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate that claim. Part of his contract agreement with \nthe TC referenced his need to \u201cexecute\u201d his tax returns after verifying the information \ntherein is correct. He testified that the TC told him that they will be filing all his late \nincome tax returns simultaneously. He assumed that the TC has filed his delinquent \nincome tax returns because he no longer receives any letters or phone calls from the \nIRS. The TC told him to check his online account drop box for his filed federal income \ntax returns, but he has not had any documents in this drop box. He last contacted the \nTC in August 2023. He claimed he does not know whether he should be worried about \nthe TC\u2019s possible lack of progress because he has never been in this situation before. \nThe only reason he has not \u201cpanicked\u201d is that the letters and phone calls from the IRS \nhave stopped. (Tr. 25-29, 35-39; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn his January 2021 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (SF \n86), Applicant reported that he owed approximately $20,000 in delinquent federal taxes \nfor the 2013 through 2019 tax years. He could not confirm that he has paid any money \ntowards these delinquent taxes. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he \nhad. He testified that he believes that he actually owes approximately $60,000 in \ndelinquent income taxes. He does not believe that the $10,000 he paid to the TC is \nmeant to be used to pay his delinquent taxes. Instead, he believes that this money is \nmeant to be used to file his income tax returns. He claimed that he will use savings in \nhis retirement account to pay his delinquent federal taxes. Any adverse information not \nalleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. I will consider it when \nassessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis.

He recognized that he made a mistake and accepts responsibility \nfor it. He plans to follow up with the TC to determine its progress on his tax returns. In \nMarch 2021, during his security interview, he told the DoD investigator that he would \nfollow-up with the TC to ensure that his delinquent income tax returns were filed and \nthat he would acquire the documentary evidence to confirm these filings. He has \nprovided the TC with the information it needs to file his income tax returns for the 2020 \nand 2021 tax years.

He owns his home, \nhaving paid the mortgage on it in about 2008. His expenses consist of his spousal \nsupport of about $480 per month, a car payment of about $550 per month, and his \nproperty insurance and property taxes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns as required for the \n2013 through 2019 tax years. He also owed about $20,000 in delinquent federal taxes \nfor these tax years. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence that he has filed his federal \nincome taxes for the 2013 through 2019 tax years. He also has not provided sufficient \nevidence that has filed his federal income tax returns for the 2020 through 2022 tax \nyears. He has not provided sufficient evidence that he has paid any money towards his \nfederal income tax delinquency. He could not confirm these things when he testified, \nand he did not provide any documentary corroboration. He has not provided his tax \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npreparer the information it needs to file his 2022 federal income tax returns. He testified \nthat his delinquent federal income tax balance is now about three times higher than \nwhen he submitted his SF 86. He only contacted the TC after he had his security \ninterview. This fact tends to show that he acted because he knew his security clearance \nwas in jeopardy. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having \nbeen placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment \nand willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Finally, \nhe has not provided sufficient evidence to show that he has an arrangement with the \nIRS to file his late income tax returns or pay his delinquent income taxes. \nWhile he has relied on his ex-wife and the TC to handle filing his federal income \ntax returns, it is incumbent upon him to insure he is complying with his financial \nobligations. It is not enough for him to pass the responsibility to someone else and \nassume they are handling it. His failure to monitor his federal tax situation with both his \nex-wife and the TC were within his control. If one were to assume, for the sake of \nargument, that his divorce, which can be considered beyond his control, caused his \nfailure to file his tax returns for the 2018 through 2022 tax years, he still needs to show \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Through his lack of attention to his \nincome tax filings and income tax delinquencies before and after he hired the TC, he \nhas not shown responsible or good-faith behavior. None of the mitigating conditions fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered his \nlengthy military service and the significant number of years that he has held a security \nclearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The objections were sustained. There were no additional \nobjections, and GE 1 through 3 and 6 through 16 were admitted in evidence.

The Government also moved \nto admit part of GE 4 that Applicant authenticated during testimony, specifically page 2 \nthe last paragraph and page 3, the first paragraph. Applicant specifically testified that the \nparagraphs were accurate and a representation of his conversation with the government \ninvestigator. Applicant objected stating that the facts were already established on the \nrecord and therefore this information was cumulative and unnecessary to amend the \nSOR. In addition, Applicant objected to the amendment to the SOR. Applicant\u2019s objections \nwere overruled. The Government\u2019s motions were granted. (Tr. 179-185) The SOR \namendment is included in Hearing Exhibit I. The SOR was amended by adding the \nfollowing allegation: \n2.c You falsified material facts during a September 16, 2015, interview with \nan authorized investigator for the U.S. Department of Defense when you \ndescribed the facts and circumstances from your NJP you received in \nFebruary 2013.

He testified prior to his deployment he had not been briefed on \ncontacts with foreign nationals. (Tr. 32, 117-120, 123-124, 187) \nIn 2012, Applicant deployed again to the same country. He had a military member \nas a roommate at the hotel. They were staying at the same hotel he had stayed at during \nhis 2007 deployment. One of the hotel staff recognized him and was aware he had a \n\u201crelationship\u201d with a woman when he was there in 2007 and inferred that he had fathered \na child during his previous deployment. Applicant testified that he asked the hotel \nemployee to provide him the woman\u2019s telephone number, which he did. He contacted the \nwoman and they met at the hotel. He asked her to return and bring the child. He testified \nthat he purchased a hotel room because his roommate was smoking in their room. She \nmet him in his hotel room with her child. He determined he was not the father of the child. \nHe ordered food through room service. They did not engage in sexual conduct during \ntheir 2012 meetings. The information about Applicant\u2019s rendezvous came to light when \nthe Naval Criminal Investigative Service was investigating potential prostitution at the \nhotel. He testified that the investigation determined she was not a prostitute. (Tr. 37-44, \n120-126) \nIn February 2013, Applicant went to a Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 15 \nnonjudicial proceeding (NJP) for violation of Article 92, failure to obey an order for \nwrongfully and knowingly having contact with a suspected prostitute in a foreign country \nand having a non-military guest in his hotel room. His punishment was forfeitures of pay \nfor two months and 45 days of restriction. He was an E-7 at the time. (Tr. 37, 41-44) \nIn June 2015, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). Section \n15 requested he provide information about his military history. It specifically asked for the \ndates of service. Applicant responded to this inquiry with his active duty dates from \n\u201c09/1994\u201d to \u201c10/2014.\u201d The SCA also asked him if he was discharged, which he \nresponded \u201cyes.\u201d It then asked for the details of his discharge, and he responded \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201chonorable.\u201d Another question asked: \u201cProvide other discharge type.\u201d Applicant \nresponded: \u201cRetired with 20 years 1 month from active service.\u201d This was information that \nwas not repopulated.

He said he was in a \u201crobotic\u201d mode and missed \nanswering this question correctly. He provided other new information as noted above, \nsuch as duty stations and his active-duty dates and characterization of his discharge. \nApplicant admitted that he did not disclose his NJP and said it was not intentional. I did \nnot find Applicant credible. I find he deliberately failed to disclose his February 2013 NJP \non his 2015 SCA. (Tr. 47; 126-132; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that when he was interviewed by a government investigator in \nSeptember 2015, he provided information about his 2013 NJP when the investigator \nspecifically asked him about the details. He said he told the investigator that he did not \ndisclose the NJP on his SCA due to an oversight. Applicant testified that he told the \ninvestigator that he was unaware that his roommate had three females in their hotel room \nfor two parties. Applicant said he did not attend the parties. He was at work. He told the \ninvestigator that there was an investigation about the females in the hotel room he shared \nwith a roommate, but they were not prostitutes. Having any guests while they were in a \nforeign country was prohibited. He said he was unaware of the party. He admitted at his \nhearing that he did not tell the investigator that he had met privately with a female foreign \nnational whom he believed could potentially be the mother of his child. He rented a hotel \nroom to meet with her, which was in violation of military orders. He met with her twice on \ntwo different days. Applicant\u2019s testimony lacked candor and was not credible. I find he \ndeliberately falsified and concealed material facts when he failed to provide accurate and \nhonest information to the government investigator and did not disclose that he met \nprivately with a female foreign national in a separate hotel room as he testified at his \nhearing. (Tr. 132-140; GE 1) \nIn 2003, Applicant was granted a conditional security clearance because of \nfinancial concerns. He was cautioned that future receipt of derogatory information or his \nfailure to comply fully with the conditions of his clearance would be cause for immediate \nreconsideration. He was required to continue to pay his child support and arrearage, \nresolve any additional delinquent debts and remain current on his financial obligations. \n(GE 6) \nIn 2011, Applicant was again granted a conditional security clearance because of \nfinancial concerns.

(GE 7) \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to never being properly educated about \nfinancial management or how credit worked. He also attributed it to his son coming to live \nwith him in 2015. (Tr. 30; GE 6, 7) \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2014. In July 2014, he had \napproximately $82,000 of debt discharged. He explained he was getting ready to retire \nfrom the military and his wife had been working only sporadically. They wanted to save \ntheir house and get a reset on their finances. (Tr. 48; GE 10) \nApplicant testified that after retiring from the military in October 2014, he was \nunable to get a job for about six to seven months. From 2015 to 2019, his wife worked \nsporadically, and they again struggled financially. He has a child who is a diabetic. He \nsaid his military medical coverage for retirees, Tricare, was expensive for her needs. He \nalso had child support payments. He and his wife were also helping her mother who was \nstruggling financially after her spouse passed away. In 2015, without prior notice, the \nmother of his son dropped him off with Applicant to care for him permanently. He testified \nthat they got behind on their car payments. He also disclosed in his July 2020 and April \n2021 SCAs that he went on a \u201cfamily vacation [c]ruise in 2015 or 2016. Cozumel Mexico \nCarnival cruise line.\u201d (Tr. 48-51, 164; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant testified that it was disruptive in 2015 when his son moved in with him \nand his family. His son was diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. He was \nfrequently in trouble at school and was suspended and expelled three times from three \ndifferent schools. He was breaking into cars and using marijuana. He would run away for \nthree to four days at a time. Applicant was concerned about his conduct and the people \nhe spent time with. His son was concerned there was a bounty on him. Applicant\u2019s son \nwas shot in February 2020. He was shot a second time in June 2020 while waiting in line \nto apply for a job. He did not survive. The crime has not been solved. This tragic event \nimpacted the whole family. (Tr. 59-63; AE R) \nIn July 2020, Applicant completed another SCA. He did not disclose any debts in \ncollection, charged off, or if he had property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed. He \nalso did not disclose that in the past seven years if he had been delinquent more than \n120 days on any debt and was currently more than 120 days delinquent on any debt, as \nrequired under Section 26. He testified that his failure to disclose this information was an \noversight. The SCA also asked if in the past seven years he filed a petition for bankruptcy. \nHe disclosed he had filed bankruptcy in 2012. (Tr. 140; GE 2) \nAs noted above Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings were in 2014. Under Section \n26, a box for optional comments is provided.

He also disclosed he filed \nbankruptcy in 2012, which was incorrect. (Tr. 141-143; GE 3) \nApplicant defaulted on his mortgage that went into foreclosure. (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nApplicant testified that the foreclosure was satisfied through his 2014 bankruptcy. He \nprovided a document to show his mortgage payment on a house he purchased in January \n2023 ($459,000) is current. (Tr. 149-152; GE 12, 15; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($17,888) (duplicate alleged in \u00b6 1.i ($21,386)) alleged a charged-off \ncar loan. Applicant testified he purchased a vehicle in October 2016 after his son began \nliving with him because they needed a bigger car. He said his wife was making the \npayments, so he was unaware when it became delinquent. He said he was confused \nabout this debt because at the time he and his wife owned two vehicles of the same make, \nbut different models. He admitted at one time he was behind on payments for both \nvehicles. He denied this debt (twice) in his answer to the SOR stating that he did not know \nthe nature or origin of the debt alleged. The car was repossessed. He admitted he was \naware of the repossession. He tried to reclaim the vehicle but was unsuccessful. He said \nhe was unaware of the balance owed. He said he could not locate the debt. He explained \nhis failure to disclose this repossession and charged-off debt on his SCA was due to an \noversight. He said he answered the SOR the way he did because he was confused \nbecause it was alleged twice and he wanted to verify it. I did not find Applicant credible. \nIn August 2023, Applicant made a payment arrangement with the creditor to resolve the \ndebt by making monthly payments of $825 from August 2023 through July 2025. He has \nmade the first two monthly payments.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a long history of accumulating delinquent debts and being unable to \npay them. He was granted a conditional clearance in 2003 and was required to resolve \nany additional delinquent debts and remain current on his financial obligations. In 2011, \nhe was again granted a conditional security clearance advising him to establish payment \nplans on all of his delinquent accounts; continue to make full and timely payments to all \ncreditors with the intent on becoming current on all accounts; and thereafter, maintain a \nstable and solvent financial status, ensuring all payments to creditors are accomplished \nin a regular and timely manner. In 2014, he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and had \napproximately $82,000 of debt discharged. In 2016, he was again accumulating \ndelinquent debts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nSince having his debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2014, Applicant has had two \ncars repossessed and eventually reclaimed one.

He satisfied medical bills that were not paid by the mother \nof his daughter. Applicant had a period of unemployment after his military retirement. He \nsaid he was out of work for several months due to surgery in 2019. His wife\u2019s work history \nis sporadic, and he was paying child support. \nI have considered that currently Applicant has only one delinquent debt that \nremains unresolved. He is no longer paying child support. I have also considered that he \ntook his family on a cruise during a period when he said he was having financial problems. \nHe also purchased a vehicle in 2019, presumably when he was either unemployed or \nreceiving reduced income, and he has monthly payments of $1,000. The greatest concern \nis that Applicant repeatedly was granted conditional security clearances, was warned and \nhas been fully aware that future issues with his finances would jeopardize his security \nclearance, and he continued to have financial issues. Even after his 2014 bankruptcy \ndischarge where he had a complete financial reset, he again had difficulty paying his bills \nand had two cars repossessed. \nApplicant has a significant payment for a repossessed vehicle that he no longer \nhas possession of and only recently made arrangements to pay. He has a twenty-year \nhistory of failing to timely meet his financial obligations. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude future financial issues are unlikely to recur based on his history. His conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nAlthough some of his financial problems may have been beyond his control, it is \nonly recently that he has acted responsibly in resolving them. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some \napplication. He has participated in financial counseling. He has resolved most of his \ndelinquent debts, except the debt for the repossessed vehicle, for which he only recently \nmade arrangements to satisfy. The question remains that based on his long history of \nfinancial problems whether he will be financially responsible in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand 20(d) have some application. Despite some mitigation, Applicant needs more time to \nestablish a solid financial track record of paying his bills on time and not accumulating \nnew delinquent debts. It is too soon to conclude he has fully mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his finances. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical or mental health professional involved in making a \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other \nofficial government representative; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging \nin activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.  \nApplicant was arrested and charged with domestic battery involving touching or \nstriking his spouse. The evidence supports that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nhis February 2013 NJP on his June 2015 SCA. The evidence supports that when \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2015, he falsified \nmaterial facts provided to the investigator, specifically that he failed to disclose that he \nhad unauthorized contact in a hotel room with a female foreign national whom he believed \nwas potentially the mother of his child. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \nApplicant successfully completed the PTD program through the Veteran\u2019s Court \nregarding his domestic violence. During that period, he was grieving the death of his son. \nAlthough, the offense is not minor, his conduct was infrequent and happened under \nunique circumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) apply to SOR \u00b6 \n2.a \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his NJP on his 2015 SCA and when \nquestioned by a government investigator in 2015, he failed to provide accurate and \nhonest information. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.c) I found Applicant\u2019s testimony often lacked candor \nand credibility. The security clearance process relies on those seeking a clearance to be \nhonest and forthcoming. Applicant failed to do so, which casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply to \nthose allegations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and character evidence. Despite some \nmitigation, I find it is insufficient to overcome the security concerns raised. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A subsequent background investigation revealed the \nfollowing delinquent accounts: a $9,459 collection debt owed as a result of an automobile \nrepossessed in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 35); a $8,595 collection debt \nas a result of an automobile repossessed in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. \n39-41); a $1,105 charged-off account owed to a credit union (SOR \u00b6 1.c: GE 3 at 2; GE \n4 at 4); a $1,029 delinquent credit card account that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: \nGE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5); a $760 credit card account that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e: GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5); a $140 charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.f: GE 3 at 2); a $1,471 \ncharged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.g:  GE 4 at 4); and a $5,698 account that was placed for \ncollection. (SOR \u00b6 1.h: GE 4 at 4) \nApplicant\u2019s former boyfriend and the father of her children, was an abusive \nalcoholic. The abuse increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, she \nmoved out of the apartment with her children. Before she decided to move out, there were \nthree domestic violence incidents initiated by her former partner that made her realize \nshe needed to move out for the sake of the children. She initially moved in with her parents \nwho live in a one-bedroom apartment. She paid her parents $1,000 a month rent when \nshe and children lived with them. She rented a place for her and the children to live a few \nmonths later. The monthly rent was $1,632.

The children\u2019s father does not \nprovide child support, although Applicant recently filed for child support about a week \nbefore the hearing. She realized the only way to get money from him would be through a \nchild support order because his paycheck could be garnished. (Tr. 26-27) \nApplicant intends to pay her debts. She does not live an expensive lifestyle and \ndoes not spend money on gambling.  She needs time to resolve her debts. (Tr. 19-20) \nThe $9,459 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was the debt remaining after one of \nApplicant\u2019s cars was repossessed in 2019. The debt was paid off through garnishment. \nHer paycheck was garnished between $700 to $900 a period beginning in May 2022. She \ntestified the garnishment stopped a few months ago. (Tr. 35-38; AE B)  She  was unable \nto pay any of the remaining SOR debts. (Tr. 39-46) She pays her current debts and her \nrent. Most of the debts alleged in the SOR occurred as result of her relationship with her \nabusive boyfriend. When she lived with him, he was not working on a regular basis. His \nmother and occasionally his sister lived with them. Neither worked. Applicant was the only \nbreadwinner in the household. She would often give her boyfriend $100 a day to buy \nalcohol so he would not bother her. (Tr. 48-50) \nApplicant has been on her own for about two years. A few months ago, Applicant\u2019s \nfather suffered a heart attack. She had to pay his mortgage while he recovered from his \nillness. This prevented her from making more payments towards her delinquent accounts. \nApplicant currently does not own a car. She takes an Uber to work because her day \nbegins earlier than when public transportation is available. She takes public transportation \nhome. Despite all of these challenges, she believes she is in a better financial situation \non her own. She is current on federal and state income taxes. (Tr. 54 \u2013 59) \nApplicant currently earns $31 per hour. She also works overtime hours. Her net \npaycheck is $2,600 a pay period. She is paid twice a month, so she earns $5,200 monthly. \nHer monthly expenses include: rent $2,000; and utilities $150 - $200. She estimates she \nhas a couple hundred dollars left over each month after expenses. (Tr. 29) \nWhole-Person Evidence \nMr. R., Applicant\u2019s superior, states Applicant is an asset to their team. She has \ncompleted all the necessary briefings regarding safeguarding sensitive information. (AE \nA)  Mr. T. has known Applicant for several years. He has observed her duty performance. \nShe is dedicated to her job and is very professional. She performs her duties in an \nexcellent manner. He has worked at a high-level state commission and currently works \nat a high-level at the federal level. He believes Applicant is worthy of maintaining her \nsecurity clearance.

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport all of the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past due or \ndelinquent debt that, with one exception, is still outstanding. This information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or under control: and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies because most of Applicant\u2019s debts arose during and shortly \nafter the breakup of her relationship with an abusive alcoholic. She is in the process of \nputting her life back together. She lives simply and her main focus is raising her three \nchildren. While she still needs to resolve the delinquent debts, the debts do not cast \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because the debts incurred by Applicant were caused by \ncircumstances beyond her control. Applicant is doing what she can to resolve her financial \nsituation. She has not incurred significant new debts. She just has a lot of delinquent debt \nincurred from a disastrous, abusive relationship. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not attend financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service. Applicant \nstill has many debts to resolve. It would be helpful to obtain credit counseling so she can \nlearn steps to deal with her delinquent accounts and to develop a plan to avoid getting \ninto additional financial trouble. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Although the \ndebt was garnished, Applicant resolved the account. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character references and her years of favorable \nemployment. I considered that she is a devoted mother to her three children and that she \noccasionally supports her parents when needed. Most of all, I considered that her partner \nand the father of her children was an abusive alcoholic. In February 2021, she was brave \nenough to leave him. He provides no support and left her with a lot of debt for her to \nresolve on her own. Applicant is doing the best she can. The anticipated court order will \nenable her to receive additional resources to raise her kids. Based on the facts of this \ncase, I do not consider her a security risk. It takes a long time to recover from the end of \na relationship. Applicant\u2019s financial situation will likely improve in the future. It is \nrecommended that she seek financial counseling from a non-profit credit counseling \nservice so she get a better assessment of her financial situation. Security concerns under \nFinancial Considerations are mitigated. Applicant is warned that if she continues to \nacquire new delinquent debts, she may lose her security clearance at some point in the \nfuture. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

She spends \nless now, and she is working on paying all her debts on time. (Item 4.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Having reviewed all of the mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20, \nI find only the following potentially applicable: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nI have considered condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts went into \ncollections between 2017 and 2019. That is not that long ago. The debts are numerous \nand remain in default today. Her debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(b). The record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial travails \nwere caused by the need for her nephews to come and live with her and her husband. \nApplicant, therefore, moved to a larger home to accommodate her nephews. That move \nand related costs increased her expenses and caused the delinquent debts she now \nconfronts. To ameliorate her financial troubles, she moved in with her adult daughter. \nAlthough she claims she is now working with her creditors to resolve her debts, she has \nnot provided any documents to support this assertion. The Appeals Board has routinely \nexpected applicants to submit documents supporting their explanations and that their \nindebtedness is being addressed concretely and is on the way to being resolved. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). On this record, I cannot find that AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 k:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(Tr. at 15, 20, \n28-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR GE 1, 2) \nApplicant accrued a number of debts from her attempt at making the restaurant \nwork, and the IRS and her state filed tax liens against her, presumably for the unpaid \npayroll taxes. The state filed liens of $14,592 in April 2011; and $55,144 in September \n2012. The IRS filed liens of $11,483 in August 2012; $51,967 in December 2012; and \n$20,900 in December 2012. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2013, and her \ndischargeable debts were discharged the same year. The bankruptcy did not affect her \nunpaid taxes. (Tr. at 15-16; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4, 6-12) \nApplicant retained an attorney to negotiate with her state. The attorney \nnegotiated an offer-in-compromise with the state. She finished paying the negotiated \namount in 2016, and the state tax liens were released in December 2020. (Tr. at 15-17, \n20-21; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant contacted the IRS several times. She was told in about 2017 or 2018 \nthat she owed so much in comparison to her income that the IRS considered the taxes \nuncollectable. The IRS would maintain the liens on her property so that it could collect \nany profit from a sale, and it would withhold any refunds she would otherwise receive, \nbut it would not actively collect the taxes unless her income significantly increased. She \nwas also told that the IRS cannot collect taxes after ten years. (Tr. at 17; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR) \nApplicant decided not to attempt to pay the taxes, and she would wait until they \nwere more than ten years old and uncollectable. She submitted an online IRS tax \naccount statement from the IRS obtained in October 2022. The earliest year shown was \n2012, which reported a balance of $13,229.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant owned a restaurant from 2008 until she had to return it to the previous \nowner in 2012. She was unable to pay many of her debts. She filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy case in 2013, and her dischargeable debts were discharged the same year. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant chose not to pay the IRS and the state the payroll taxes she withheld \nfrom her employees\u2019 wages. That constitutes an unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so. AG \u00b6 19(b) is applicable to the payroll taxes. AG \u00b6 \n19(f) addresses income taxes, not payroll taxes. AG \u00b6 19(f) is not applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe failure of Applicant\u2019s restaurant was beyond her control. I find that filing a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy case was a responsible way to deal with the debts other than the \npayroll taxes. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nApplicant was in a difficult situation, but not paying payroll taxes was not an \nacceptable option. If a business cannot pay its employees\u2019 payroll taxes, it is not a \nviable business and it should fail. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and \nsystems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, \n2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as paying \ntaxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable to the unpaid payroll \ntaxes. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe state payroll taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) were paid in about 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(d) and 20(g) are applicable to the state payroll taxes. \nApplicant has done nothing to resolve the federal payroll taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.c), except to wait until they become more than ten years old and uncollectable. The \nAppeal Board has long recognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance \npurposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the statute of \nlimitations. That is, a judge may consider the underlying circumstances of these \nuncollectable debts in evaluating whether an applicant demonstrated good judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n27, 2003). Reliance on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to \nresolve debts and is of limited mitigative value. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01231 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2015). \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat she made a good-faith effort to pay her payroll taxes. Her financial issues continue \nto cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There are \nno mitigating conditions applicable to the unpaid payroll taxes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant has \nnot reported to his security officer or anyone else at his employer that he is using \nmarijuana because he knows that it is a security violation. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 39-42; \nItem 5 at 1.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Purchase of marijuana from February 2020 to at least July 2021 while \ngranted access to classified information. Applicant purchased marijuana in 2019 in a state \nwhere it was legal to do so. When he began using marijuana daily in 2020, he purchased \nthe drug from his grandson and continues to do so because it is illegal to purchase \nmarijuana in his home state. He also intends to cultivate marijuana for his personal use, \nwhich he asserts is legal under the laws of his state. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 41; Item 5 at \n1.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Intent to continue to purchase and use marijuana in the future. \nApplicant intends to continue using marijuana because it provides the best management \nof his pain. He stated in his security clearance interview that he would consider ceasing \nhis illegal drug use if he has to stop in order to keep his security clearance. He said that \nhe would need to discuss his options with his doctors. His doctors are aware that he uses \nmarijuana for pain management. There is no updated information in the record, including \nin the Response, as to whether Applicant has ever engaged in the cultivation of marijuana. \n(Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 40; Item 5 at 1.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nThe admitted facts in this case establish all of the above disqualifying conditions \nand shift the burden to Applicant to provide mitigation of the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns. Guideline H lists four conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate security \nconcerns raised by the potentially disqualifying conditions set forth above. The following \ncondition has possible application to the facts in this case. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana has occurred under \nunusual and sympathetic circumstances. However, the circumstances do not make it \nunlikely that his use of marijuana will not recur. Applicant had the opportunity before \nsubmitting his Answer and again before submitting his Response to consult with his \nmedical providers about alternatives to marijuana use for pain management and to cease \nusing marijuana, but the record closed without any such actions. Even if he had ceased \nhis illegal drug use at some point, it may not have mitigated all of the security concerns \nraised by his recent drug use while holding a security clearance. Notably, he failed to \ndisclose his illegal drug use to his Facility Security Officer or anyone at his employer \nbecause he knew that his drug use was a violation of his responsibilities as a clearance \nholder. Applicant\u2019s behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his use of marijuana while \nholding a security clearance, his purchase of marijuana, and his stated intent to continue \nusing marijuana in the future. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. I have weighed Applicant\u2019s lengthy service in the Navy and his honorable \ndischarge and retirement from the Navy. I have also weighed the difficult choice Applicant \nhas had to make between addressing his pain from a serious illness and his obligations \nto safeguard classified information and comply with Federal drug laws. The record \ncontains no information about any efforts Applicant has made with the advice of his \nmedical providers to eliminate marijuana as a pain management drug and find a suitable \nlegal alternative in the form of prescription medication. As noted, his failure to report his \ndrug use is an aggravating factor raising doubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H:  \nAGAINSTAPPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He testified that he advised his command \nof his disability and his inability to drill with his unit. He did not appear before an \nadministrative separation board. He received a letter advising him that he was being \nseparated under other than honorable conditions. Upon being questioned, he \nacknowledged that he missed drills for \u201ca year or two\u201d in the 2017-to-2018 period.

(Tr. at 30-40.) \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his \ncriminal conduct, which raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness; and about his ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation of criminal conduct. The \nspecifics of the charges, the underlying conduct, and the prosecution are as follows: \n1.a. May 2018 Spousal Assault. Applicant was charged with Assault by Means \nLikely to Produce Great Bodily Injury and four counts of Battery. His wife, the victim in this \nassault, declined to prosecute Applicant, and the District Attorney dropped the charges. \nThe local City Attorney then filed charges. Applicant entered into an agreement with the \nprosecutor in 2022 or 2023, which provided that the charges would be dismissed in April \n2023 if Applicant complied with the terms and conditions of the agreement. The charges \nwere dismissed about two weeks before the DOHA hearing. (Tr. at 22-23, 541; GE 1 at \nSection 22; GE 5; AE D.) \nThe police report of the incident reflects the date and time of the domestic violence \nincident as May 25, 2018, at 7:40 am. The police were called and arrived at Applicant\u2019s \nresidence. They took a statement from Applicant\u2019s wife. The police statement provides a \ndetailed description of Applicant\u2019s actions that morning, which began with yelling by \nApplicant because his wife woke him up to go to work. He then threw a blanket over his \nwife\u2019s head and strangled her with his hand or arm for about 30 seconds. She could not \nbreathe during that period. She freed herself from his grip, and he pushed her face onto \na couch cushion for about a minute when she again could not breathe. She freed herself \nand tried to escape. Applicant then grabbed her hair and banged her head against a wall \n10 to 15 times. Four days after the incident, a police officer met with Applicant\u2019s wife and \nread her statement to her. He asked if everything she said in her statement was correct, \nand she affirmed that it was. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied everything in the \nstatement starting with her comment that she woke him up that morning so that he could \ngo to work. (Tr. at 44-45; GE 4 at 23, 29, 40.) \nThe police also took a statement from a neighbor (the Witness), who lived in the \napartment above Applicant\u2019s residence. The Witness reported that she heard an \nargument in Applicant\u2019s apartment and then screams from Applicant\u2019s wife. She believed \nthat her neighbor was in distress. She also heard thumping noises. The Witness decided \nshe should intervene and knocked on the door to Applicant\u2019s apartment and rang the \ndoorbell. Applicant answered the door and reported to her that everything was fine. The \nWitness entered the apartment and found Applicant\u2019s wife sitting on the floor, \u201cshaking \nand crying hysterically.\u201d The Witness returned to her apartment and shortly thereafter, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife appeared at her door.

In an email dated June 27, 2022, \nApplicant\u2019s wife wrote that she called the police. Applicant testified that none of what the \nWitness told the police was correct. The police report described the wife\u2019s demeanor \nwhen they arrived as \u201cupset,\u201d \u201ccrying,\u201d \u201cfearful,\u201d and \u201cnervous,\u201d confirming the Witness\u2019s \nstatement about her condition that morning.

(Tr. at 45-50; GE 4 at \n19, 29, 32; AE G at 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife also reported to the police that Applicant had been physically \nviolent with her in the past. She said that he had been physically abusive to her throughout \ntheir 17 months of marriage, which is when she immigrated from Japan and they began \nto cohabitate. She told the police that about once a month he would grab her hair or her \nhead and slam her head into a wall in their apartment. She never sustained serious \ninjuries and was never hospitalized. She did not seek medical attention after the May 25, \n2018 incident, though she did complain about head pain. Applicant denied that he had \never physically abused his wife. (Tr. at 52; GE 4 at 22.) \nAfter her interview by the police, Applicant\u2019s wife requested that she be taken to a \nwomen\u2019s shelter. She asked that the Witness accompany her. The police took her to a \nfacility for placement in a shelter. Later that day, Applicant\u2019s wife obtained a restraining \norder against her husband. Applicant was also ordered to be removed from the couple\u2019s \nresidence. A few months after the May 2018 incident, a more limited protective order was \nentered, and Applicant was allowed to return to his residence. That order was continued \nto at least January 2022, according to the court records, though Applicant testified that \nthe order was lifted. Applicant provided an undated document that reflects the dismissal \nof the restraining order proceeding. (Tr. at 51; GE 4 at 24, 40-47; AE B.) \nApplicant denies that any assault occurred on May 25, 2018, or at any other time. \nHe testified that one morning in May 2018, he had an argument with his wife and the \nargument attracted the attention of their neighbor, the Witness. He claims that the \nallegations against him were made up by his wife at the urgings of the Witness with whom \nApplicant and his wife had an unfriendly relationship. He blames the bad, \u201caggressive\u201d \nrelationship on the neighbor frequently asking him and his wife for financial assistance or \nto borrow personal property. He testified that he declined all such requests. He claimed \nthat as a result of their interactions, Applicant and his wife were \u201con bad terms\u201d with the \nWitness. (Tr. at 19-21.) \nApplicant testified that after the argument with his wife, he went to work. The police \ncame to his home while he was at work. When he returned home, he learned that he had \nbeen \u201cevicted\u201d from his residence. Based upon the police investigative report, the District \nAttorney\u2019s office filed five domestic violence charges against Applicant, including one \nfelony charge. Applicant insisted that the Witness encouraged his wife to make the \ncomplaint against him and that the charges were false. He attributed his wife being \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \nmanipulated by the Witness or misunderstanding the police due to her poor English skills. \n(Tr. at 21-25; GE 3 at 9.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Japan and lived there until she immigrated to the \nUnited States in January 2017 to marry Applicant. Her primary language is Japanese \nthough at the time of their marriage she spoke some English. She had studied English \nwhen she was in school and had traveled to the United States in 2015 when she first met \nApplicant. He testified that although he spoke a little Japanese, they communicated in \nEnglish while they were dating and communicating long-distance. Before they had their \nchild in October 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife worked in a restaurant where she \u201chad to\u201d \ncommunicate in English. (Tr. at 21-29, 40-44, 62; GE 1 at 36.) \nGE 5 contains a court record for a proceeding in which Applicant\u2019s wife appeared \nand addressed the court in English on April 24, 2019, less than a year after the incident \nwith Applicant. The court found that an interpreter was not needed because she could \nunderstand and speak English. The initial police report also shows that Applicant\u2019s wife \nwas able to communicate clearly with the police about the incident in a one-on-one \ninterview. As noted, she also confirmed to the police the accuracy of her statement four \ndays later. (GE 4 at 22-24; GE 5 at 6.) \nMitigation \nApplicant\u2019s wife prepared an email, dated June 27, 2022, addressed to the \nprosecutor in her husband\u2019s criminal case. In her communication, she asked for help in \nhaving the case dismissed. At that time, his case was scheduled for trial the next month. \nShe wrote that she regretted calling the police in 2018 \u201cevery day.\u201d She noted that prior \nto the incident, she had suffered a back injury in 2017 and had surgery in March 2018. \nShe commented that she was stressed after her surgery and called the police after an \nargument with her husband. She also wrote that a neighbor \u201ctold me I should call the \npolice.\u201d The record evidence reflects that the prosecutor ultimately offered Applicant an \nagreement that terminated the case on April 25, 2023, after Applicant completed an eight-\nweek anger management/domestic violence course on March 4, 2023. He was also \nrequired to be \u201cbooked.\u201d (Tr. at 23-24, 54-56; AE D; AE G at 1; AE I; AE J.) \nApplicant submitted two letters (and duplicate copies of the letters) of support. The \nletters were dated April 19, 2018, which was before the domestic violence incident and \nthe criminal charges, and April 22, 2019. Applicant worked for this employer from 2017 to \n2019. He has since worked for two other companies. One letter from an executive of his \nformer employer praised Applicant\u2019s excellent customer service. The second letter was \nprepared by Applicant\u2019s former manager. He noted Applicant\u2019s professionalism in the \nhandling of his duties and his care for his wife after she suffered a serious injury.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct      \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise security concerns under this \nguideline. The following condition is potentially applicable in this case and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence supports the criminal charges filed against Applicant, \nspecifically, that he committed serious and repeated acts of violence against his wife on \nMay 25, 2018. This occurred a little over a year after his marriage to the victim. \nSignificantly, the District Attorney and the City Attorney reviewed the evidence developed \nin the police investigation and concluded that there was probable cause to file criminal \ncharges against Applicant. This evidence satisfies the Government\u2019s burden of proof. The \nGovernment has not alleged Applicant\u2019s OTH Separation as potentially disqualifying \nunder Guideline J, \u00b6 31(e) even though any military discharge or separation \u201cfor reasons \nless than \u2018Honorable\u2019\u201d is potentially disqualifying under that provision of the Directive. As \na result, I have not considered the OTH Separation as disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline J. \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct shifts the burden to him to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his conduct. AG \u00b6 32 sets forth four mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline J. The following three mitigating conditions have possible application to \nthe facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) has not been established. The record includes evidence that Applicant \nseriously abused his wife at least monthly throughout the first 17 months of their marriage. \nEven though the charged offenses occurred five years ago, such behavior could recur in \nthe future because Applicant provided no convincing evidence to show that he has sought \ntreatment or taken other steps to end his abusive conduct, other than an eight-week \ncourse Applicant agreed to take in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. It is \nimportant to note that until two weeks before the DOHA hearing, Applicant was pending \ntrial on domestic violence charges. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior, his lack of \nacceptance of responsibility, and my negative conclusions about his credibility and \nhonesty (see below) all cast serious doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) has not been established. There is significant, reliable evidence in the \nrecord to support that Applicant committed the criminal acts of strangling his wife and \nbeating her head repeatedly against a wall. Applicant\u2019s denials of the criminal charges \nfiled by both the District Attorney and then the City Attorney lack credibility. In fact, his \ngeneral demeanor throughout the hearing suggested that he was fabricating facts to \nsupport his version of his narrative. Similarly, much of his testimony simply lacked \ncredibility, including his testimony minimizing his conduct that led to his OTH Separation \nfrom the Army Reserve in June 2018, three years after his motorcycle accident in the \nsummer of 2015. Applicant\u2019s attempt to blame the Witness for instigating and fabricating \nthe entire basis for the criminal charges was also not believable, nor was his claim that \nthe Witness was motivated to lie about him due to personal animosity against both \nApplicant and his wife. Also, Applicant\u2019s attempt to argue that his wife had insufficient \nEnglish language skills in May 2018 to avoid being manipulated by the Witness was \ncontrary to the record evidence. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) has not been established. Applicant has denied any criminal behavior. \nHe has not accepted responsibility for his abusive actions against his wife, and therefore \nhas not shown any remorse or taken any steps to avoid similar conduct in the future. \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree shortly after the May 25, 2018 criminal conduct. \nHis resum\u00e9 reflects that he has taken classes to receive two certifications since 2018. \nOtherwise, there is a paucity of evidence of successful rehabilitation. \nOverall, Applicant has not met his burden to establish mitigation of the Guideline J \nsecurity concerns set forth in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                  \n              \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have also weighed the \nrecord evidence in light of the whole-person factors quoted above. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant\u2019s transparently deceptive demeanor and testimony about key facts \nweigh heavily against him as a trustworthy and reliable person. Also, his OTH Separation \nfrom the Army Reserve in 2018 weighs against his worthiness to be entrusted with \nsensitive U.S. national security information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 48 years old and is married with two adult children. He has a high school diploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Lead Supervisor Janitorial. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. On October 21, 2013, Applicant was granted a Top Secret security clearance. He is currently working for two defense contractors. He began working for defense contractor A in January 2017, where he works part-time. He began working for defense contractor B in November 2018, who is currently sponsoring him for a security clearance. The SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to three creditors totaling approximately $21,000, for delinquent accounts that have been charged off. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated November 7, 2020; December 27, 2021; and August 15, 2022, confirm the indebtedness.

Items 1 through 7 will hereinafter be referred to \nas Government Exhibits 1 through 7. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old and is married with two adult children. He has a high \nschool diploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Lead \nSupervisor Janitorial. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nOn October 21, 2013, Applicant was granted a Top Secret security clearance. \nHe is currently working for two defense contractors. He began working for defense \ncontractor A in January 2017, where he works part-time. He began working for defense \ncontractor B in November 2018, who is currently sponsoring him for a security \nclearance. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to three creditors totaling \napproximately $21,000, for delinquent accounts that have been charged off. \nApplicant \nadmits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant \ndated November 7, 2020; December 27, 2021; and August 15, 2022, confirm the \nindebtedness. \nThe following delinquent debts remain owing: \n1.a.  A delinquent debt is owed to a bank for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $12,199.  There is no evidence to show that Applicant has done \nanything to resolve the debt.  The debt remains owing. \n1.b.  A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $5,521.  There is no evidence to show that Applicant has done \nanything to resolve the debt.  The debt remains owing. \n1.c.  A delinquent debt is owed to a bank for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $3,139.  There is no evidence to show that Applicant has done \nanything to resolve the debt.

It is not clear whether these conditions caused his current \nfinancial indebtedness, since there is nothing else in the record that explains why he is \nexcessively delinquently indebted. \nApplicant stated that he intends to work with the creditors in good faith and \nestablish payment arrangements as soon as possible. He failed to submit any evidence \nin mitigation. There is nothing more in the record to show that he has taken any action \ntoward resolving his debts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debts totaling approximately $21,000. These \naccounts have been charged off by the creditors. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to each of the three creditors set forth in the \nSOR. He has failed to provide any evidence in mitigation. He stated that he intends to \nwork with the creditors in good faith to establish payment arrangements as soon as \npossible. There is no evidence to show that he has contacted the creditor, set up an \nagreeable payment arrangement, or otherwise resolved the debts. He gives no reason \nor excuse for his excessive indebtedness. \nHe has known for some time that his \nfinancial delinquencies and numerous unpaid bills pose a threat to his security \nclearance eligibility, and he has done nothing to resolve the issue. His debts remain \ndelinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long reflects a pattern of unreliability, \nuntrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nApplicant fails to meet the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He \nis opposed to any prescription drugs that are typically used to reduce anxiety or \ndepression. He \u201cavoid[s] them like the plague.\u201d He intends to continue using Edibles in \nthe future because \u201cthe pain never goes away.\u201d He acknowledged that he is aware that \nTHC is an illegal drug under Federal law. He views his only alternative to THC is the use \nof opioids, which he dislikes because they are addictive. (Tr. at 28- 31, 39-45.) \nApplicant candidly testified that he uses Edibles because without them he will \u201ccry \nhimself to sleep every night.\u201d He suffers from sadness and depression every day, but only \nuses the Edibles at night because they help him sleep. He finds it overwhelming to deal \nwith so much grief every day. His plan for the future is to continue focusing on his work, \nwhich he asserts he performs well. He will also continue surfing on the weekends and \nafter work. When he needs the relief provided by the Edibles, he will continue to take \nthem to help him sleep. He commented that he will \u201cnot be a free man until the day I die. \nThere is no resolution.\u201d (Tr. at 46-49.) \nApplicant disagrees with the Psychologist\u2019s evaluation of his condition because he \ndoes not believe he is dependent on marijuana or THC (collectively, THC). He views the \nPsychologist\u2019s diagnosis of Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder as concluding that \nApplicant is dependent on THC. Applicant testified about his recent experience of taking \na two-week vacation with his wife when he could not travel with Edibles to other states. \nDuring that vacation, he was comfortable not using Edibles because there were few \nsituations that triggered intense grief. He experiences those triggers regularly when he is \nat home where he keeps his son\u2019s ashes. He acknowledged that the Psychologist\u2019s \nconclusion that Applicant is reliant on THC to stabilize his mood is \u201c60% accurate.\u201d He \nengages in other activities to remain calm, like surfing. (Tr. at 31-33, 43.) \nParagraph 2 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security \nclearance because he has a psychological condition that raises security concerns. \nSpecifically, the SOR alleges the Psychologist gave Applicant a guarded prognosis due \nto Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) that is untreated other than a prescription for \nmarijuana. In his Answer Applicant denies this allegation and provides additional \ninformation and opinions regarding his view that the Psychologist\u2019s opinion is erroneous. \nAt the hearing Applicant acknowledged that he is not currently participating in any \ntreatment. He does not find grief counseling useful. He participated in grief counseling for \ntwo years after his son\u2019s death and found that discussions about the seven stages of grief \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto be repetitive and unhelpful.

(Tr. at 34-36.) \nThe Psychologist\u2019s report, dated January 6, 2022, is part of the record. In his \nreport, the Psychologist noted that three counselors have treated Applicant in the past \nand that Applicant advised that he had been diagnosed with PTSD. Applicant has only \nreceived treatment during a six-month period. The Psychologist\u2019s test results confirmed \nthis diagnosis. He also affirmed a prior diagnosis of Applicant of Unspecified Cannabis-\nRelated Disorder. The Psychologist gave Applicant a \u201cguarded\u201d diagnosis. He wrote that \nApplicant \u201cseems reliant on the substance [THC] to maintain a stable mood.\u201d His ultimate \nconclusion was that Applicant\u2019s \u201cPTSD and marijuana use could pose a significant risk to \nhis judgment, reliability or trustworthiness concerning classified information at the present \ntime.\u201d (GE 2 at 8-9.) \nMitigation \nApplicant honorably served in the Navy for four years and was discharged with a \ndisability. In 2015 he suffered the tragic loss of his only son with whom he was very close. \nSeven years later he continues to grieve, kissing the urn holding his son\u2019s ashes before \nhe retires for the night. He sleeps poorly and thinks of his son and the loss of his son \nevery day. He is opposed to using prescription medications to treat his suffering and \nstrongly believes that his use of Edibles is the best treatment option. He complied with \nthe laws of his state to obtain a prescription authorizing him to purchase and use Edibles. \nHe believes that he would be a greater risk to national security if he used opioids to \nmanage his PTSD and grief. He describes his honesty as his strength and his fault, noting \nthat he could have lied in his e-QIP and his use of Edibles would never have become an \nissue. (Tr. at 49.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 25 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed social worker) of \nsubstance use disorder; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, and his detailed testimony regarding his \nhistory of using Edibles and his intent to continue to do so, as well as the Psychologist\u2019s \nreport, establish all of the above disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug involvement: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant illegal drug use is current, frequent and is \nlikely to recur. Also his behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially established. It is arguable that Applicant suffers from a \nsevere and prolonged mental illness during and that a doctor gave him a medical \nmarijuana card that permitted him to legally purchase Edibles under the law of his state \nof residence. That type of drug is not, however, within the normally accepted meaning of \nthe term \u201cprescription drugs\u201d under this mitigating condition. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s use of \nEdibles has not ceased. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counselling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nThe Psychologist\u2019s report establishes the above condition and shifts the burden of \nproof to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by the report. AG \u00b6 29 lists the \nfollowing five conditions under Guideline I that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom the opinions of the mental health provider in the record evidence: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established by the facts of this \ncase. Applicant\u2019s \u201ctreatment plan\u201d involves the use of a controlled substance that is not \nlegal under Federal law. Accordingly, the treatment plan cannot be viewed under Federal \nlaw as a legitimate plan. Applicant is not currently participating in a counseling or a \ntreatment plan utilizing prescription drugs that are legal under Federal law. In addition, \nhis current diagnosis is guarded. Applicant has not submitted a recent opinion of a duly \nqualified medical profession to rebut the recent opinion of the Psychologist. Applicant\u2019s \npsychological condition is not temporary or resolved, and according to the Psychologist, \nApplicant continues to show indications of emotional instability. Moreover, his \npsychological condition can be expected to continue in the future unless he agrees to \nparticipate in appropriate counseling and a legal treatment plan, including taking drugs \nthat are prescribed for his condition and are lawful under Federal law. Paragraph 2 of the \nSOR is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant has to face daily a significant emotional problem due to \nthe sudden and premature death of his son. He suffers greatly from the emotional trauma \narising from this tragedy. He has not, however, successfully confronted his condition, and \nhe is not under the treatment of mental health professionals. He has not provided \nsatisfactory evidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised by his continued use of \nEdibles to maintain a degree of emotional stability. He continues to suffer from a mental \nhealth condition that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information at the present time.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all SOR allegations. He also provided mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old investigator who has worked for his current employer since September 2018. (Tr. 6, 11-12) In 2002, he graduated from high school (Tr. 7) He served in the Air Force from August 7, 2007, to January 18, 2013. (Tr. 7) He was a senior airman (E-4) when he received an honorable discharge from the Air Force. (Tr. 7-8) His Air Force specialty was special duty assigned to the honor guard. (Tr. 8) He was discharged because he was injured and unable to run. (Tr. 9) His Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability rating was increased from 40 percent to 60 percent in August or September 2022. (Tr. 60) He receives $1,600 monthly from the VA. (Tr. 55) His gross income is about $69,000, which is near the national average. (Tr. 56) In 2006, Applicant married. (Tr. 10) He believes he was divorced in 2023; however, he is unsure whether his divorce is final because his spouse filed for divorce online. (Tr. 10) His 16-year-old daughter and his 19-year-old stepdaughter live with him.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A, the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) \n2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA did not find under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F.

(HE 1) The \nhearing was held as scheduled using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. \n(Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11 exhibits into evidence, and \nApplicant did not offer any documents into evidence. (Tr. 14, 18-22; GE 1-GE 11) All \nproffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 22; GE 1-GE 11) \nOn July 7, 2023, DOHA received a copy of the transcript. Applicant provided three post-\nhearing exhibits, which were admitted into evidence without objection. (Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A-AE C) The record closed on July 28, 2023. (Tr. 58, 62; HE 5) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all SOR allegations. He also provided \nmitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old investigator who has worked for his current employer \nsince September 2018. (Tr. 6, 11-12) In 2002, he graduated from high school (Tr. 7) He \nserved in the Air Force from August 7, 2007, to January 18, 2013. (Tr. 7) He was a senior \nairman (E-4) when he received an honorable discharge from the Air Force. (Tr. 7-8) His \nAir Force specialty was special duty assigned to the honor guard. (Tr. 8) He was \ndischarged because he was injured and unable to run. (Tr. 9) His Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) disability rating was increased from 40 percent to 60 percent in August or \nSeptember 2022. (Tr. 60) He receives $1,600 monthly from the VA. (Tr. 55) His gross \nincome is about $69,000, which is near the national average. (Tr. 56) \nIn 2006, Applicant married. (Tr. 10) He believes he was divorced in 2023; however, \nhe is unsure whether his divorce is final because his spouse filed for divorce online. (Tr. \n10) His 16-year-old daughter and his 19-year-old stepdaughter live with him. (Tr. 11, 38)   \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant said his delinquent debts resulted from his spouse\u2019s temporary disability, \nwhich resulted in a reduction in her pay by 50 percent, which was followed by the loss of \nher employment in late 2017 or early 2018. (Tr. 32; SOR response) Applicant and his \nspouse fell behind on some debts while she was on partial disability. (Tr. 32-33) She was \nunemployed for a few months, and then she found employment at about 25 percent less \nthan her previous pay. (Id.) She sued her former employer and in September 2018, she \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceived an $18,000 settlement, which she used to resolve some of her debts and to \npurchase a vehicle. (Tr. 34) In 2018, Applicant was being paid $18 an hour. (Tr. 37) \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. He also \ntook some financial classes. (Tr. 55) \nThe SOR alleges the following financial concerns: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a bank filed a judgment in September 2021 against Applicant \nfor about $14,819. The debt resulted from a car loan which Applicant\u2019s spouse obtained \nto purchase a new vehicle in 2017. (Tr. 32; SOR response) The monthly payment was \n$400. (Tr. 32) The judgment amount after costs and fees totals about $18,000. (AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for about $10,518. The debt \nresulted from a car loan which Applicant obtained in 2017 to purchase a new sports car. \n(Tr. 30-31, 53-54; SOR response) The monthly payment was $780. (Tr. 31) He \ncharacterized the purchase of the sports car as a \u201cstupid\u201d decision; however, he learned \nfrom it and purchased an inexpensive used vehicle as a replacement after the sports car \nwas repossessed. (Tr. 53) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for about $10,413. He obtained \na $10,000 personal loan. (Tr. 39) He paid about $4,000 in interest; however, in the \nsummer of 2018, he stopped making payments. (Tr. 40) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a judgment originating from a bank was filed against Applicant \nin February 2020 for about $1,186. He used the funds from the bank loan for daily living \nexpenses. (Tr. 41) Applicant said after the creditor obtained the judgment, he was pretty \nsure he made some payments. (Tr. 41-44) However, he did not provide documentary \nevidence showing any payments. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f allege Applicant has two charged-off debts owed to the same \nbank for about $899 and $650. He did not make any payments to address these debts. \n(Tr. 45) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant has a charged-off store debt for $475. He did not \nmake any payments to address this debt. (Tr. 45) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2016, and his \nnonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in about June 2016. Applicant was \nunemployed from July 2015 to January 2016, and his spouse was not employed outside \ntheir home. (Tr. 23-24) They moved to a different state, which enabled his spouse to find \nemployment in December 2015. (Tr. 23-24) His spouse\u2019s annual pay at her new \nemployment in January 2016 was about $30,000. (Tr. 25) When he went to a bankruptcy \nattorney, his attorney told him to stop paying his creditors. (Tr. 29) The debts discharged \nthrough this bankruptcy totaled about $93,000, and it consisted mostly of car loans for \nrepossessed vehicles (unrelated to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) and credit card debts.

Applicant\u2019s spouse prepared their tax returns. (Tr. 28) When Applicant \nmoved to a new state, he was surprised when he received a bill for a car tax. (Tr. 27) He \nbelieved his spouse may have paid a car tax bill instead of a state income tax bill. (Tr. 27) \nHe said the state tax debt will be paid. (Tr. 57) In his Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) interview, he said his state income tax debt was for TYs 2016, 2017, and 2018. \n(GE 2 at 2) The original balance was $8,000 to $10,000. (Id.) He owes a state tax authority \nabout $200 for TY 2022. (Tr. 56) On July 27, 2023, he made a $50 payment to the state \ntax authority. (AE B) After his hearing, he said he paid his state tax debt. (AE B; AE C) \nAfter Applicant separated from his spouse, he saved about $2,000, and he \nintended to pay some of his SOR creditors; however, his spouse lost her employment, \nand he decided to help her financially instead of paying his creditors. (Tr. 45) Once she \nobtained employment, he believed she would pay him back. (Tr. 46) \nApplicant\u2019s current pay is $25 an hour. (Tr. 46) He said a creditor has been \ngarnishing $500 monthly from his pay since November 2022; however, Applicant said he \ndoes not know which creditor is garnishing his pay. (Tr. 46-47) \nAfter his spouse received her settlement of about $18,000 in tax year (TY) 2018, \nthey owed additional federal income taxes. (Tr. 47) He contacted the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) and established a payment plan in which he paid $500 monthly for about \none year. (Tr. 50) When he filed his federal income tax return for TY 2022, he owed the \nIRS about $2,000 for that tax year. (Tr. 47) He currently owes the IRS a total of about \n$12,000 to $15,000. (Tr. 48) The IRS has transferred any refunds to address his \ndelinquent tax debt. (Tr. 51) \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 29, 2020 SCA, he said he owed an estimated $3,700 in \nstate income taxes; the status was \u201ccurrent\u201d; and the debt \u201cwill be paid off by the end of \nthe year.\u201d (GE 1 at 49) He said, \u201cI have payment arrangement for my federal taxes \nbecause I could not afford to pay in full. I thought the arrangement included state taxes \nbut it did not. . . . [He] agreed to a $200 garnishment [from] every paycheck.\u201d (Id.) \nI requested Applicant provide copies of his federal income tax transcripts for the \nprevious five years and proof that his state income tax returns were paid. (Tr. 57-58) I \nalso asked for proof of any payments to any other SOR creditors. (Tr. 59) The only proof \nof payment provided after his hearing was documentation showing a $50 payment to the \nstate tax authority, and no tax returns or tax transcripts were provided. (AE B) \nIn his closing written statement Applicant said: \n. . . I feel that most people in my position would probably file for bankruptcy, \nbut I do not want to take that route again. I know it takes longer to come \nback from, but I would rather save and pay back my debts than take the \neasy route. Currently the garnishment that is being taken from my check is \npaying off [the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a] at a rate of $1000 a month to a balance \nof $13517.28 based off an email that was sent to my work email 11/22.

My\n[state] taxes have been paid, attached is the final amount that was sent to\ncollections and paid. [AE B] This is the first opportunity that I have really\nhad to pay off my debts since divorcing my wife. Even though many of the\naccounts were joint, I have been the one affected, my wife has never been\ngarnished or paid towards any of our joint debt. As I have mentioned my\nclearance affects my job and my potential future. I plan on going back to\nschool to finish my degree in cyber security and having a clearance is\nparamount to my degree. I am trying to better my situation and make more\nmoney so that I can pay off my debts. I have no other negative infraction\nagainst me other than my debts. I have had some bad luck as far as my\nwife losing her job and relying on one income, I will admit that I overreached\nin my [vehicle] purchase [related to SOR \u00b6 1.b]. I have learned from that\nmistake as I mentioned and now have a much more affordable car payment\nthat will be paid off within the next year. I pay my bills on time and live within\nmy means. It was my mistake to let my ex-wife control our finances as I\nhave much better control over it. If I am given the opportunity to hold my\nclearance by the time my next investigation is due[,] I will be completely\ndebt free. I have learned from the past and will continue to strive to better\n[my own] and my kid\u2019s situation. . . . [AE C]  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d  \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He and his spouse were \nunemployed or underemployed or both. He and his spouse moved to a different state. His \nspouse was injured and on disability. He was separated and then divorced from his \nspouse. These circumstances were partially or fully beyond their control and adversely \naffected his finances. He did not provide sufficient details to assess the magnitude of the \nadverse effect on his overall finances or his efforts to make progress resolving the \ndelinquent accounts. \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in \npart, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider \nwhether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with the SOR creditors over the years or that he worked \ndiligently to timely pay his debts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2016, and his \nnonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in about June 2016. He was unemployed \nfrom July 2015 to January 2016, and his spouse was not employed outside their home. \nThey moved to a different state, which enabled his spouse to find employment in \nDecember 2015. His spouse\u2019s annual pay was about $30,000. When he went to a \nbankruptcy attorney, his attorney told him to stop paying his creditors. The debts \ndischarged through the bankruptcy totaled about $93,000, and they consisted mostly of \ncar loans for repossessed vehicles and credit card debts. Bankruptcy is a legally \nauthorized means for resolving debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to this bankruptcy, and SOR \u00b6 \n1.h is mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished by a state tax authority for \nabout $5,585. His spouse prepared their tax returns. He said the state tax debt was paid \nthrough a voluntary garnishment of his income, and he made the final payment of $50 in \nJuly 2023. This debt is resolved. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant has owed federal income taxes since 2019 \nbecause his spouse received a settlement in 2018, and federal income taxes were not \nwithheld from the settlement. He described his federal income tax debt during his OPM \ninterview. He owes the IRS about $2,000 for TY 2022. He did not provide any \ncorrespondence from the IRS or IRS tax transcripts showing his federal income tax debt \nwas or is in an established payment plan. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an \nSOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

The \nnon-SOR allegation will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts are charged off or eventually will not appear on his \ncredit report or both. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit report is not \nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd.

He said he intends to pay \nhis taxes at this point; however, the Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where \nan \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that \n[applicant] is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude \ncareful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely pay \nfederal income taxes when due. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June \n15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of conduct \nand employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of \naccess to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of \nthe SOR).  \nApplicant received financial counseling with his bankruptcy, and he took some \nfinancial classes. Applying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, he did not prove that he \nwas unable to make greater progress sooner by establishing payment plans with more of \nhis SOR creditors, including the IRS. Three SOR debts are less than $1,000 each. He did \nnot provide any documentation showing his attempts to address these three debts. Under \nall the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old investigator who has worked for his current employer \nsince September 2018. He served in the Air Force from August 7, 2007, to January 18, \n2013. He was a senior airman when he received an honorable discharge from the Air \nForce. He received a 60 percent disability rating from the VA, which results in a $1,600 \nmonthly payment from the VA. His VA disability rating was increased from 40 percent to \n60 percent in August or September 2022. His gross income is about $69,000, which is \nnear the national average. \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. He \nprovided multiple reasons for his financial difficulties. He acted reasonably when he filed \nfor bankruptcy in March 2016 and when he agreed to a voluntary garnishment of his pay \nto address his state income tax debt. He has provided contributions to his employer and \nthe national defense. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial \nconsiderations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this time than the \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to make greater \nprogress sooner resolving his delinquent debts. He did not take sufficient actions to \nprovide documented evidence of his actions to address his federal income tax debt. His \nfailure to take prudent, responsible, good-faith actions raise unmitigated questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 48 years old, married, and has four children and three stepchildren. Four of the children live with Applicant and their mother. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years and retired honorably in January 2015 as a member of the Submarine Force as an Auxiliaryman (E-6). He held a security clearance while in the Navy. Since 2018, he has worked for a U.S. Government contractor as a quality assurance specialist. He has applied to continue his security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 24; GE 1 at Section 2, 15, 17, 18, 25.) Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR identified five past-due or charged-off debts owed by Applicant totaling about $40,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and commented that he has paid one of the debts. He also argued that three of the debts will be removed from his credit report in 2023 or 2024 and a fourth is \u201cclosed.\u201d The existence and amounts of all five debts is supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in the Answer and by credit reports in the record, dated January 11, 2023; October 13, 2021; and March 12, 2021.

The case was heard as scheduled on \nMarch 8, 2023. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which I admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on March 15, 2023. (Tr. at 16-20.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old, married, and has four children and three stepchildren. \nFour of the children live with Applicant and their mother. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy \nfor 20 years and retired honorably in January 2015 as a member of the Submarine Force \nas an Auxiliaryman (E-6). He held a security clearance while in the Navy. Since 2018, he \nhas worked for a U.S. Government contractor as a quality assurance specialist. He has \napplied to continue his security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 24; GE 1 \nat Section 2, 15, 17, 18, 25.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nidentified five past-due or charged-off debts owed by Applicant totaling about $40,000 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations \nand commented that he has paid one of the debts. He also argued that three of the debts \nwill be removed from his credit report in 2023 or 2024 and a fourth is \u201cclosed.\u201d The \nexistence and amounts of all five debts is supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in the \nAnswer and by credit reports in the record, dated January 11, 2023; October 13, 2021; \nand March 12, 2021. (Answer; GE 2, GE 3, GE 4.) \nApplicant first started to experience financial problems in about 2015 and the year \nor so after his Navy retirement. He was unemployed for a period and in November 2015, \nhe had a bad motorcycle accident that kept him from working for a period. He then had \nmore periods of unemployment and underemployment. He defaulted on all of the SOR \ndebts during the first two years following his retirement. (Tr. at 30-31, 49-53: GE 1 at \nSection 13A, 26.) \nApplicant testified that he and his wife presently have monthly take-home pay of \nabout $9,700. In addition, he has monthly retirement benefits from the Navy of about \n$1,500 and VA disability benefits of about $160. Their total net monthly income is over \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$11,000. Based upon his off-the-cuff calculations of his monthly expenses, he believes \nhe has on average about $2,000 left over at the end of every month. He presently has \nabout $1,000 in savings. At one time, he had about $8,000 in savings, but it has been \nreduced recently due to some emergency expenses and because he loaned money to a \nfamily member who lost his job. In light of his savings history, Applicant\u2019s estimated net \nmonthly remainder appears to be based upon an incomplete listing of his monthly \nexpenses. (Tr. at 33-46, 59.) \nApplicant never contributed to a Thrift Savings Plan account when he was a \nservicemember. He does not contribute to his current employer\u2019s retirement account. (Tr. \nat 59-60.) \nThe current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $14,638. The creditor that \ncharged off this credit-card account is the same creditor that charged off the debts listed \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He was able to keep these accounts current until he retired, but \nwithout stable new employment, his savings alone were not enough to pay his debts. The \ncreditor has transferred these three debts to a collection agency. In the week or so prior \nto the hearing, Applicant tried to contact the agency to discuss settlement options, but he \nhas not been successful in reaching anyone. He wants to slowly \u201cchip away\u201d at these \nthree debts when he is able to do so. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 54-60; GE 3 at 2; \nGE 4 at 2.) \n1.b. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $9,173. Applicant took \nout this loan to purchase a motorcycle. The motorcycle is the same one that was involved \nin an accident in November 2015. It was a total loss. See discussion in SOR \u00b6 1.a, above. \nThis debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 60-62; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3.) \n1.c. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $5,106. This debt is for \nan auto loan that Applicant could not afford after his retirement. The car was repossessed. \nSee discussion in SOR \u00b6 1.a, above. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; GE 2 at 4; \nGE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3.) \n1.d. Personal Loan Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $10,792. Applicant \nopened this account when he was on active duty in the Navy. He needed the credit to pay \nfor travel expenses to see his mother, who had suffered a heart attack. He subsequently \nretired and had little income to repay this loan. In November 2015, after his retirement, \nhe also had medical expenses due to a motorcycle accident. He was unable to work for \nan extended period. He also incurred significant medical bills. This debt is not resolved. \n(Tr. at 49- 52; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 3.) \n1.e. Cellular Phone Account in Collection in the Amount of $794. Applicant \ntestified that he paid this account in July 2021, when his finances finally became stable \nenough so that he could afford to pay this collection account. He provided no \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumentation to corroborate his claim that the debt is paid. The debt only appears on \nthe Government\u2019s earliest credit report, dated March 12, 2021 (GE 4). That credit report \nreflects the debt has been placed for collection. Based upon the totality of the record, I \nfind that this debt is resolved. (Tr. at 46-48; GE 4 at 3.) \nMitigation \nAccording to the credit reports in the record, Applicant has paid and closed two \ndelinquent accounts with debts totaling $2,000, (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 4-5). Those debts \nwere not alleged in the SOR. He has also paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. His debt-\nresolution strategy is to pay the smaller debts first, including the debt alleged at SOR 1.e \nand the two debts that were not listed in the SOR, and then as his finances permit, start \npaying down the larger debts. He testified that the experience of discussing all of his debts \nin a hearing was a \u201csobering\u201d experience. He said that he wants to \u201cchip away\u201d at his \ndebts, but he acknowledged that it is difficult to do that with a large family creating a lot \nof competing financial priorities. Applicant\u2019s finances today are much more stable than \nthey were during the 2015-to-2017 period. He has not incurred any delinquent debts since \nhe defaulted on the last of the five SOR debts in 2015 or 2016. (Tr.at 53-64.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant owed approximately $40,000 for five past-due debts, as of the date the \nSOR was issued. These facts render the foregoing disqualifying conditions applicable and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. Guideline F includes the following \nfour conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial delinquencies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are only partially established. Applicant\u2019s debts arose \nfollowing his retirement from the Navy when he was unemployed for a period and then \nwas unable to work due to injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident. Applicant\u2019s \ninitial difficulty finding employment after his retirement is a circumstance largely beyond \nhis control, as was his loss of income after his accident. Since August 2018, he and his \nwife have obtained financial stability and are now earning significant net monthly incomes. \nIt cannot be concluded, however, that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances \nin addressing his past delinquencies. Several years have passed since 2018. It was only \na week before the hearing that Applicant sought to contact the collection agency holding \nthree of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s behavior casts doubts of his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received any financial \ncounseling. He has a theoretical concept for repaying his debts, starting with the smallest \ndebts and working up to the largest. In about July 2021, he paid one SOR debt before the \nSOR was even issued. At some point before the SOR was issued in April 2022, he paid \ntwo other small debts. Since those payments some time ago, Applicant has not taken any \nserious steps to address his four remaining SOR debts. Accordingly, there are no clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has only taken the first of many steps \nnecessary to implement a plan to repay his delinquent debts. Accordingly, he has not \ninitiated and is not adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. I have given substantial weight to Applicant\u2019s 20 years of service in the Navy \nand his honorable retirement. I have also credited his integrity and sincerity with which he \nresponded to the questions asked at the hearing. It is clear that he suffered a big setback \nin his financial stability after retiring from the Navy and especially after his accident \ndisabled him and he could not work for a substantial period of time. I have also weighed \nthe fact that he has not become further indebted since 2017 and that his current monthly \nfinances are stable, even with his large family to house, feed, and provide care. All of \nthese positive traits, however, are outweighed by the fact that he has not taken any \nsignificant steps to address his past delinquent debts starting with seeking the advice of \na financial counselor who can help him budget his sizable monthly family income and set \naside funds every month so that he can begin to pay down his remaining four debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance at this time. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from April 2011 to June 2015. He has been married twice. He divorced his first spouse in July 2020 after seven years of marriage and married his current spouse in February 2021, but they are currently separated. (Item 2 at 21-22, 32.) He has no children from his first marriage and from his current marriage he has two minor-aged stepchildren and a child born of the marriage in August 2021. (Tr. at 33.) Applicant has been employed by his sponsor since October 2019 and received a promotion in April 2021. His initial annual salary was $66,000 and after his promotion it was $77,000. Prior to joining his employer his annual salary was $44,000. (Tr. at 28-29.) His first spouse had limited part-time jobs, so he was providing for them on his $44,000 salary. (Tr. at 30.) He initially received a low disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but in late 2020 he was reevaluated, which resulted in higher rating that increased his monthly disability payments by over $1,600. The increase occurred at about the time he married his second spouse. (Tr. at 32.) The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $38,962, reflected in two credit reports from July 2021 (GE 3) and February 2022 (GE 4).

On \nApril 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR was amended in January 2023, \nto add an allegation under Guideline D. The DoD acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the original SOR on May 25, 2022, and the amended SOR on \nFebruary 1, 2023, and in each Answer he requested a hearing before an administrative \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge.

On March 23, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for May 31, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 and \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through B were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and presented character testimony from a co-worker. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on June 8, 2023. \nI kept the record open after the hearing to allow the parties to submit documentary \nevidence. The Government offered GE 7, a 27-page exhibit consisting of documents from \nApplicant\u2019s pending criminal trial. Applicant timely submitted four exhibits: a monthly \nbudget (AE C), a May 2023 bank statement (AE D), his Navy and Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal citation (AE E), and a behavioral health report (AE F). All post-\nhearing exhibits were admitted without objection. The record closed on June 14, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from April \n2011 to June 2015. He has been married twice. He divorced his first spouse in July 2020 \nafter seven years of marriage and married his current spouse in February 2021, but they \nare currently separated. (Item 2 at 21-22, 32.) He has no children from his first marriage \nand from his current marriage he has two minor-aged stepchildren and a child born of the \nmarriage in August 2021. (Tr. at 33.) \nApplicant has been employed by his sponsor since October 2019 and received a \npromotion in April 2021. His initial annual salary was $66,000 and after his promotion it \nwas $77,000. Prior to joining his employer his annual salary was $44,000. (Tr. at 28-29.) \nHis first spouse had limited part-time jobs, so he was providing for them on his $44,000 \nsalary. (Tr. at 30.) He initially received a low disability rating from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA), but in late 2020 he was reevaluated, which resulted in higher rating \nthat increased his monthly disability payments by over $1,600. The increase occurred at \nabout the time he married his second spouse. (Tr. at 32.) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $38,962, reflected in two credit \nreports from July 2021 (GE 3) and February 2022 (GE 4). Applicant offered a May 2023 \ncredit report that no longer showed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and 1.f. (AE B.) \nHe testified he had taken the initiative to call his primary creditor and had gone over his \ncredit report to look at the debts he and his wife had. He stated he called the financial \ninstitution that held four of the debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and 1.f, to see what his repayment \noptions were for the accounts. He explained he would pay what he could and noted he \nhad paid some debts in full. He offered he would make a budget to address the debts he \ncould not afford to pay. (Tr. at 40; AE C.) He took out a hardship loan from his 401(k) \nretirement account in 2023.

(Tr. at 41-43.) \nGuideline F \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f: four accounts charged off in the amounts of $18,552; \n10,739; $6,493; and $1,005, respectively. Applicant admits the respective debts with \nthe credit institution. He has not established payment plans for these accounts. The last \npayments were in the 2016-2017 period. He and his former spouse were \u201cliving beyond \n[their] means\u201d and he could not make the payments because of his salary at the time. He \nwas aware of the debts but had been trying to resolve his smaller debts first. He \nacknowledged SOR \u00b6 1.f was simply missed. He notes they have all fallen off his credit \nreport. (Tr. 22-23, 25; AE B.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e: student loans placed for collection in the amounts of $1,137 \nand $1,036. Applicant admits the debts. He stated the loans had been frozen by the \nDepartment of Education (DoEd) during COVID and they were not requesting payment. \nHe enrolled in the Fresh Start Transfer Program seven days prior to the hearing and was \nnotified the day before the hearing that a determination was forthcoming. He stated if the \nloans were not approved for the Fresh Start Transfer Program the two loans will be \nrenewed with a new lender. He stated he will abide by whatever the repayment plan is \nestablished to pay off the loans. (Tr. at 24; AE-A.) \nI have taken administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the President directed the DoEd to provide the following temporary relief on \nDoEd-owned federal student loans: suspension of loan payments, stopped collections on \ndefaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, \nand Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for the above relief measures through \nSeptember 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 \nat 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt relief was extended several times by \nsubsequent Executive Orders. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-\n19. Congress recently barred any further extensions and DoEd has announced that \nstudent loan repayments will resume in October 2023. See https://studentaid.gov/debt-\nrelief-announcement. \nGuideline D  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: This allegation alleges that Applicant was arrested on October 5, 2022, \nand charged with Aggravated Sexual Battery; and that the felony charge remained \npending. In answering SOR \u00b6 2.a in the Amendment to the SOR, he admitted the SOR \nallegation and noted that the case remained pending and cited a court date of May 22, \n2023, (Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.a.) His middle school aged stepdaughter accused him of \n\u201cinappropriate touching of her behind\u2026 and that [he] requested to touch her privates.\u201d \n(Tr. at 64.)

He declined to say if his stepdaughter\u2019s \nallegations were false because he has no recollection of the incidents. He did not \u201cbelieve \nshe would lie about something that happened.\u201d (Tr. at 67.) He explained that he is not \ndenying the allegations by his stepdaughter and cites his sleep disorders for his lack of \nmemory for why he cannot recall any incidents. (Tr. at 69, 77-78, 81, 83.) During his \nDOHA hearing, he testified that he only remembers \u201cit from a nightmare because [he] \nkept reliving the allegation over and over. But what [he] remember[s] is, we were sitting \non the couch watching cartoons. I had my arm back around her and my hand on her leg. \nLike on the side. And I adjusted, because I was uncomfortable, and I accident[ly] touched \nher vagina.\u201d (Tr. at 68.) He stated essentially the same in his police interview. (GE 7 at \n15-16.) \nApplicant has been under the care of a licensed professional counselor since \nJanuary of 2023. He sought treatment voluntarily. He began reaching out to the counselor \nin August of 2022 after a referral from the VA. On his own initiative he walked into the \noffice after being unsuccessful making phone contact. His counselor indicated he had \nbeen \u201cvery proactive in seeking out treatment.\u201d (AE F.) He is described as compliant and \nworking hard in the therapy process and has to date done nothing to violate the terms of \nhis bond. He remains in the community because he is compliant and does not present \nhimself as a risk to the community. His counselor notes, without drawing any conclusions, \nthat Applicant is working hard in therapy to understand and work through his own history \nof childhood sexual abuse which he encountered at a very young age. (AE F.) \nAs of June 8, 2023, when the record closed, Applicant\u2019s criminal trial remained \npending. (GE 7) \nApplicant offered the testimony of a work colleague and former Marine. The \nwitness was very credible. He detailed his familiarity of some of the things Applicant had \novercome and events in the Applicant\u2019s life that had set him back. The witness understood \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and circumstances surrounding the \nconduct of Applicant. He allowed Applicant to stay with him and his family after Applicant \nhad been removed from his home. He identified the presence of rehabilitative potential in \nApplicant based on how accountable Applicant had been with all that had happened. (Tr. \n98, 102-103.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the evidence the establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \n\u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accrued delinquent consumer debts after a divorce. The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply.

It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge to\ndeliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in\naddressing financial problems. For example, to receive full credit under Mitigating\nCondition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d His recent actions to resolve two debts\nonly after receiving the SOR does not receive this mitigating credit. See ISCR Case No.\n08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish that he has made a good-\nfaith effort to pay or resolve his debts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant completed his SCA in April 2021. He testified he addressed two debts, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, by enrolling in a deferral program just prior to the hearing. He relies \non the fact the credit report he provided no longer shows the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f). \nAn applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be \nlacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 7, 2017). Additionally, he relies on the fact the credit report he provided no longer \nshows the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f). Evidence that debts are no longer contained in \ncredit reports is not sufficient for a finding that they have been resolved. See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01607 (App. Bd. April 9, 2015). AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is detailed in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment\nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion,\nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise\nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior\nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or\nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this\nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the\nindividual. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13 (c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13 (d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated sexual battery in \nOctober 2022. AG \u00b6 13(a) applies. In addition, while the criminal trial remains pending, \nApplicant testified during his hearing that he had touched his stepdaughter\u2019s vagina but \ndenied doing so intentionally. He declined to say if his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations were \nfalse because he has no recollection of the incidents. He did not \u201cbelieve she would lie \nabout something that happened.\u201d (Tr. at 67.) He also did not deny the allegations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(c) and 13(d) also both apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; \nand \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate\nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated\nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has\nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional\nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted he was arrested and charged with aggravated sexual battery. \nHe acknowledged the sexual behavior, which resulted in his arrest and being charged, \nboth in his police interview, after which he was arrested, and in his testimony. He \ndescribed his touching of his stepdaughter as unintentional but stated in the hearing and \nto the police he did not think his stepdaughter would lie. His treatment is recent and \nongoing. His admitted actions with his stepdaughter leave him vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, and duress and reflect a lack of judgment. The above mitigating conditions \ndo not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and D in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nD and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and sexual \nbehavior. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nCharles C. Hale \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(Tr. 40) He continues to have bi-weekly contact with \na friend with whom he used marijuana after his discharge from the Army. (GX 8 at 10) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2021, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question \nasking if, in the last seven years, he had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, \nmarshal or any other type of law enforcement official; charged, convicted, or sentenced \nfor a crime in any court; or if he currently was or had been on probation or parole. He \ndisclosed his arrest in September 2017 for simple possession of marijuana, but he did not \ndisclose his arrest in October 2018 for felony possession of marijuana, and he did not \ndisclose that he had been placed on probation twice for his two marijuana-related \nconvictions.

(GX 8 at 8-9) He testified \nthat he did not fully disclose his drug involvement in his SCA because he forgot about it. \nHe testified that he was in a \u201cbad place\u201d and that he tries not to think about it. (Tr. 33) \nCredit reports from July 2021 and July 2022 reflect that Applicant has eight \ndelinquent debts. He enlisted in the Army at age 17, immediately after graduating from \nhigh school. He attributed his delinquent debts to his financial inexperience and not \nunderstanding money management. (Tr. 27) The evidence concerning these debts is \nsummarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: consumer debt charged off for $4,409. The July 2022 credit report \nreflects that Applicant previously had two loans from this creditor that were paid, and the \nmost recent payment on the debt alleged in the SOR was in April 2022. (GX 3 at 4) \nApplicant submitted a statement claiming that he is making monthly $100 payments by \nphone. (AX B) He submitted no documentation to support his claim. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: personal loan from credit union charged off for $3,824. Applicant \ntestified that he obtained this loan to make repairs on his car. (Tr. 44) After his interview \nwith a security investigator, he made a payment agreement in March 2022 providing for \nmonthly $100 payments. (Tr. 45) He has paid $1,203 and owes a balance of $2,634.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts and his unwillingness to resolve the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. Applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts reflect a continuing course of conduct and are \u201crecent\u201d for the \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd.

It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e, because Applicant provided no \ndocumentary evidence that he is making monthly payments on these debts. When an \napplicant claims that a debt is resolved or is being resolved, it is reasonable to expect him \nor her to present documentary evidence supporting those claims. See ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.f, because \nhe did not begin to resolve these debts until he was confronted with them by a security \ninvestigator. It is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which Applicant settled \nafter receiving the SOR. \u201cA person who begins to address concerns only after having \nbeen placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019). The fact that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nno longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent \nevidence as to the disposition of the debt. See ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 13, 2019). It is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which Applicant \nhas refused to pay. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established for the car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Although \nApplicant disputes this debt, he submitted no documentary evidence of the basis for the \ndispute or actions to resolve it. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(f) (\u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position\u201d) is not established. Although Applicant apparently had a \nsecurity clearance when he used marijuana, there is no evidence that he had actual \naccess to classified information at the time. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 (App. Bd. \nAug.10, 2022). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long \nago) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There are no bright line rules \nfor determining when conduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time \nhas passed without any evidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). Applicant\u2019s drug involvement was frequent and did not occur \nunder circumstances making it unlikely to recur. His last drug involvement was in 2020, \nafter he was convicted of marijuana possession in February 2019 and while he was on \nprobation and working for a defense contractor. In light of his long history of drug \ninvolvement while in the Army, while he was on probation and working for a defense \ncontractor, I am not satisfied that his drug involvement is mitigated by the passage of \ntime. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement. As noted in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 26(a), insufficient time has passed \nsince his last drug involvement. He no longer has contact with the woman with whom he \nused marijuana while he was in the Army, but he admitted that he continues to have bi\u00ad\nweekly contact with a friend with whom he used marijuana after he was discharged from \nthe Army. He has not signed a statement of intent as described in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not make any effort to correct the \nomissions from his SCA until he was confronted with the evidence by a security \ninvestigator. He did not attempt to correct or explain his omission during his security \ninterview on September 21, 2021, until he was confronted with the evidence at the \nhearing. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications were recent, both pertaining \nto his current application to retain his clearance. They did not occur under unique \ncircumstances. They were not minor offenses. An applicant who deliberately fails to give \nfull, frank, and candid answers to the government in connection with a security clearance \ninvestigation or adjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd.

Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts, drug involvement, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

The assessments were psychosis, rule out fixed delusions; major \ndepression, recurrent; and other sexual dysfunction not due to a substance or known \npsychological condition.

He stated that he told the provider in 2016 that he was not \nhaving thoughts of hurting himself or someone else. He stated that the provider then \nasked him, if he could kill his spouse, how would he commit the act, to which he said, \u201cI \nguess I\u2019ll stab her.\u201d He told the psychologist that he did not have any intent to do so. \nRegarding the incident with his then wife, he told the psychologist that they began \n\u201ctouching each other\u201d and eventually had intercourse. He stated that he thought it was \nconsensual, and that he did not think it was rape because she never said \u201cno.\u201d (GE 8) \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder, severe, in \npartial remission.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.

No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was hospitalized after expressing suicidal and \nhomicidal thoughts, and that he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, severe \nwithout psychotic features. Thoughts are not behavior. AG \u00b6 28(a) is not applicable. \nMajor depressive disorder is a condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) is established by that diagnosis. AG \u00b6 28(c) is \nestablished by the hospitalization. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant sought treatment from the mental health clinic, \nwhere he was diagnosed with major depression, recurrent. Seeking treatment is a \npositive response to mental health issues and potentially mitigating. It does not raise a \ndisqualifying condition. The document from the mental health clinic states that Applicant \nwas assessed with major depression, recurrent. I am unsure who provided that opinion. \nIn any event, this assessment is redundant with the diagnosis when he was an inpatient \nat a psychiatric facility.

That is an accurate synopsis of the evaluation. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThere is no evidence of any significant mental health issues after 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife has forgiven him, and they have reconciled and had another child \ntogether. His job performance has been excellent, and his supervisor raved about him. \nNonetheless, I have remaining concerns. Applicant\u2019s conduct and mental state in \n2016 are alarming. He heard voices; he had suicidal and homicidal thoughts; he \nthreatened to kill his then wife; he provided inconsistent statements through the years; \nand his sexual assault of his then wife amounts to rape. None of the mitigating \nconditions are sufficient to alleviate those concerns. Psychological conditions security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant \u201cforcefully had sexual relations with [his] then \nspouse.\u201d That constituted a criminal sexual assault. The conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The conduct also \ncreated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an \nadverse determination under the sexual behavior and criminal conduct guidelines. \nHowever, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was a serious crime. It occurred almost seven years ago, \nand his former wife has forgiven him and moved past it. He was never charged or \nprosecuted, which cuts both ways, because it is not clear from the record whether he \ncould still be criminally charged. I also note the fact that he threatened to kill his then \nwife and provided inconsistent statements over the years. Applicant\u2019s conduct continues \nto make him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress; and it casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and I in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and psychological conditions security concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nOn September 30, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit \nany response. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. \nProcedural Issue \nIn the FORM sent to Applicant in November 2022, Department Counsel moved to \namend the SOR to conform to the proof. That proposed amendment would add \nallegation \u00b6 1.o using the following language: \nYou failed to file, as required, [State X] income tax returns for at least tax \nyears 2015 through 2021. As of the date of this FORM, the income tax \nreturns remain unfiled. \nApplicant did not reply to the FORM and therefore he did not admit or deny the \nproposed amended allegation. I consider his failure to respond as a denial of the \nallegation. Pursuant to the Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.13, the motion to amend the SOR as \nidentified above is granted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n), except for \u00b6 1.o. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since August 2020, as a subject matter expert. Since 2008, he has worked \nfor various defense contractors. He had short periods of unemployment (March-April \n2020; July-September 2018) in the past. He is a high school graduate and has taken \nsome college courses. He is married for the second time and has two adult children. He \nhas held a security clearance in the past.

Applicant admitted in his August 2022 answers to \ninterrogatories that he failed to file his 2015-2021 federal and state income tax returns. \nHe also admitted in his SOR answer that he failed to file his federal tax returns for the \nsame time period. (Items 3, 5) \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he hired a tax resolution \ncompany (Tax Firm) in July 2022 to file his delinquent federal tax returns for tax years \n2015-2021. While he or the Tax Firm requested and received \u201cW-2 Wage and Tax \nStatements\u201d for years 2015-2021 from the IRS, there is no documentary evidence \nshowing that Applicant\u2019s delinquent returns were filed.

There is \nno documentary evidence showing that he filed his state returns. His tax filing issues \nare unresolved. (Item 5; SOR answer) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed nine delinquent medical accounts totaling \napproximately $2,600. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.k, 1.m-1.n) Applicant admitted owing these debts in his \nSOR answer. The debts are also supported by listings as delinquent debts in credit \nreports from February 2021, September 2021, and November 2022. Applicant claimed \nhe was unaware of these medical debts when he was interviewed in March 2021. These \ndebts remain unresolved. (Items 5-8, SOR answer) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed four delinquent consumer accounts \ntotaling approximately $9,200. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.l) He admitted these debts in his \nbackground interview and in his SOR answer. The debts are also supported by listings \nas delinquent debts in credit reports from February 2021, September 2021, and \nNovember 2022. The November 2022 credit report reflects that Applicant made \npayments toward SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1c., reducing the balance owed for both debts. \nAn earlier credit report reflects that \u00b6 1.l was paid. Of these consumer debts, only SOR \n\u00b6 1.d is unresolved. (Items 3, 5-8) \nApplicant cited a number of reasons leading to his financial difficulties. These \nreasons include having to rely on short-term disability pay in 2017 or 2018, where he \nreceived 60% of his normal pay; unemployment from July 2018 to September 2018, due \nto a layoff; and unemployment from March to April 2020, due to a job termination. (Items \n4, 5) \nApplicant\u2019s financial worksheet that he completed in August 2021 reflects a net \nmonthly income of $4,587 and total monthly expenses of $4,121, leaving a monthly \nremainder of $466. Other than his hiring of the Tax Firm to file his tax returns, there is \nno evidence of financial counseling. (Items 3, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015-2021 federal and state income tax returns \nand there is no evidence that he filed them. He also has delinquent medical and \nconsumer debts, some of which remain unpaid or unresolved. I find all the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. His federal and state tax \nreturns remain unfiled. He did not provide sufficient evidence to show that his financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He had several problems, \nsuch as unemployment and having to rely on disability income, at a reduced rate of \n60%. However, the evidence does not support a finding that he has taken responsible \nactions to address his debts or timely file his federal and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes fully apply. \nApplicant failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent \nmedical debts. He paid one consumer debt and is making payments on two other debts. \nThose debts are resolved in his favor. Other than hiring Tax Firm to work on filing his \ntax returns, there is no evidence of financial counseling and no evidence that his \nfinancial conditions are under control. He has not shown a good-faith effort to address \nhis debts or his federal and state tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), 20(g) and do not apply, \nexcept as noted above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his medical and \nunemployment issues, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts, \nand his failure to timely file his 2015-2021 federal and state income tax returns. \nApplicant has not established a track record of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d-1.k, 1.m-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c, 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GX 1 at page 45.) \nApplicant avers, in part, that she did not know the use of marijuana was illegal. (TR at \npage 19 lines 3~25.)  I find this to be a willful falsification as the use of marijuana is \nillegal under Federal law. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was not legal in State A where \nshe resided prior to May 2016. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used marijuana with varying frequencies from 2008~2021. She has \nheld a security clearance in connection with her job since 2018. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), \n(c), and (f) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana usage was two years prior to this writing, and 14 \nmonths prior to the issuance of the SOR. She has also provided a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from future drug involvement, and three negative drug tests. I find that \nher past marijuana usage is not of present security significance. Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsified her 2017 and 2021 e-QIPs. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur. \n \n \n \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant falsified her e-QIP in 2017 as to her past \ndrug involvement, and continued this ruse by falsifying her 2021 e-QIP. Personal \nConduct is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant performs her job well. \n(AppXs F and G.) However, overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nPersonal Conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant has failed to \nmitigate his history of marijuana use and drug-related criminal conduct. He also failed to \ncredibly establish that he will abstain from future use. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 14, 2022, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as \namended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, \n2017.

I) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 36, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, as a \nsoftware engineer since August 2008. He completed his first security clearance \napplication in March 2021, disclosing marijuana use from July 2005 to March 2021. He \nalso disclosed obtaining a medical marijuana license from his state of residency in \n2018, so that he could use the drug legally under his state\u2019s law. Applicant also \ndisclosed two drug related criminal incidents: a December 2008 for possession of \nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, and December 2017 citation for \npossession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. The SOR alleges \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use as well as his 2008 and 2017 drug-related arrests. \n(GE 2; AE A) \nApplicant began using marijuana in July 2005, the summer before he entered \ncollege. He used the drug recreationally in social settings while in college. He estimated \nthat he used the drug at least twice per month. When he moved out on his own in 2010, \nafter graduating, his use of marijuana increased. He reported that between 2010 and \n2012, he used marijuana at least four times a month either in social settings or alone. \nBetween 2012 and 2019, he estimated that his marijuana use increased to once per \nweek in social settings. He obtained a medical marijuana license in December 2018. \nFrom 2019 and 2021, he used marijuana twice per week, using one-third of a gram from \na vape pen before bed. He no longer uses the drug recreationally, but for pain \nmanagement and as a sleep aid. He reported having a medical condition that benefits \nfrom his use of marijuana as well as lingering pain from an unspecified car accident. \n(GE 3) \nIn December 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of drugs, possession of marijuana, and possession of marijuana \nparaphernalia. Applicant parked his car a short distance away from his parent\u2019s home \nwhere he was living at the time, to smoke marijuana. He was observed by a police \nofficer, who approached the car. Upon smelling marijuana coming from the car, the \nofficer asked Applicant if he was under the influence of marijuana, which he denied. \nApplicant consented to a search of his car, which revealed drug paraphernalia. The \nofficer administered a breathalyzer test, but it did not detect any alcohol. Applicant was \narrested and transported to the police station where he gave a blood sample, which \ncame back positive for marijuana. He entered into a plea agreement in which he \npleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and the other charges were dropped.

(GE 3-5) \nIn December 2017, he received a citation for possession of marijuana and \npossession of marijuana paraphernalia. During a traffic stop for speeding, the officer \nsmelled marijuana coming from Applicant\u2019s car. Upon questioning from the officer, \nApplicant admitted to having the drug in the vehicle. He had a vaporizer pen, containing \nless than one gram of marijuana inside. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to \ncomplete a pre-trial diversion program. The court also ordered him to complete a \nsubstance abuse class. During the class, he tested positive for marijuana, which was \npermitted because he had a valid a medical marijuana license. He completed the \ndiversion program in June 2019 and the charges were dismissed. (GE 3) \nIn his November 2022 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported that \nbetween 2019 and 2022, he continued to use marijuana one or two times per week. In \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant reported that in June 2022 he filed a motion to \nexpunge the 2017 charges from his record. He also claims that he has discontinued \nmarijuana use but did not provide a date of last use. He also acknowledged that his \neffort to stop smoking marijuana proved more difficult that he expected. He did not \nprovide a sobriety plan or indicate his participation in a sobriety support program. He did \nnot provide a statement of intent to abstain from future use. (GE 3; AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis  \nThe record contains evidence to support the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant engaged in disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. He did not provide any evidence to mitigate any of the alleged \nconcerns. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant admits using marijuana from at least 2005 to at least November 2022, \nas well as pleading guilty to drug-related criminal offenses in 2009 and 2018. The illegal \nuse of controlled substances can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 25) The following disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 26(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nNone of the relevant mitigating conditions apply. Although the medical use of \nmarijuana may be decriminalized in Applicant\u2019s state of residency, this does not alter \nfederal law or existing National Security Guidelines. No state can authorize the violation \nof federal law. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use violates the Controlled Substances Act, which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Under the Intelligence Reform and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTerrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, federal agencies remain prohibited \nfrom granting a security clearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance. (See \nDirector of National Intelligence Memorandum, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use, dated November 17, 2014). The Agency clarified its guidance \nconcerning marijuana for individuals eligible to access classified information in a \nmemorandum dated December 21, 2021: \nWith regard to the first topic, agencies are instructed that prior recreational \nmarijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative. The [Security Executive Agent (SecEA)] has provided \ndirection in SEAD 4 to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person \nconcept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has \nbeen mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable \nadjudicative determination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not \nlimited to, frequency of use and. whether the individual can demonstrate \nthat future use is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or \nother such appropriate litigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing- \nfederal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a \nsensitive position or holding a security clearance, agencies are \nencouraged to advise prospective national security workforce employees \nthat they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon initiation of the \nnational security vetting process, which commences once the individual \nsigns the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions.  \nApplicant has a long history of marijuana use both recreational and medicinal. \nSince at least 2019, he has used marijuana to self-medicate to alleviate medical issues. \nHe continued to use marijuana after applying for access to classified information. He \nhas not provided credible information to support a finding that he will abstain from future \nmarijuana use. \nWhole-person Concept \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts \nunder the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, which \nhe believes is the best method of managing the symptoms of his medical condition, \nviolates federal law. Applicant resolved the conflict of interest between treating his \nongoing medical issues and violating federal law in favor of his self-interest. In doing so, \nhe casts doubt on his trustworthiness and reliability as potential clearance holder. The \nevidence suggests that he will resolve other potential conflicts of interests in a similar \nmanner. Applicant\u2019s current and ongoing use of marijuana, even for medical purposes, \nis incompatible with the interests of the national security. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He was born abroad and immigrated to the \nUnited States with his parents, as a teenager in 2001. (Item 4 at 9) He has been a \nnaturalized citizen since 2010.

(Item 4 at \n12) \nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant spent the next three years traveling internationally. \n(Item 4 at 79) He was not employed. He paid for this extensive travel using credit cards and \ndisability pay. After returning home, he enrolled in college, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2020. (Item 4 at 20) He is waiting for a defense contractor to hire him, pending the outcome \nof this security clearance investigative process. \nApplicant was unable to satisfy the credit card bills that he incurred while traveling \ninternationally. By 2020, these bills had become delinquent in the approximate amount of \n$31,000. (Item 3) \nAfter graduating from college in 2020 Applicant began satisfying the debts. He has \nsatisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e, totaling $3,038. (Item 3 at 4) He contends \nthat he has resolved 1.f, totaling $646 and is making payments towards the resolution of \n1.c, totaling $4,750, but provided no supporting documentation. He contends that he will \nbegin satisfying the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.a and 1.b once he satisfies the debt \nalleged in subparagraph 1.c. Applicant provided no evidence that he keeps a budget or that \nhe has consulted with a financial counselor. Applicant acknowledges that borrowing money \nthrough his credit cards to travel internationally while unemployed was not responsible. \n(Item 4 at 79) \n Policies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant spent three years living abroad while unemployed and with limited means to \nsupport himself, consequently incurring $31,000 of delinquent debt. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means . . . which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of \nlate payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators,\u201d apply. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain outstanding. Consequently, the \nmitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does \nnot apply. \nApplicant readily admits that his decision to travel internationally while unemployed \nwith limited means to pay for trip expenses was not responsible. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is inapplicable. \nThere is no record evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 \n20(e), \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d is inapplicable. \nApplicant has reduced his total indebtedness by approximately $3,000 by satisfying \nthe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e. However, he provided no evidence supporting his \ncontention that he has begun satisfying the other debts. Consequently, although he \ndeserves credit for initiating a good-faith effort to satisfy his delinquent indebtedness, it \nremains unclear whether he is currently adhering to a plan to repay creditors. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and Is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is only partially applicable. The \nremaining mitigating conditions are not relevant to Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant deserves credit for acknowledging that his irresponsibility led to his\nfinancial problems. Also, he deserves credit for satisfying the debt alleged in subparagraph \n1.e. Conversely, whatever progress he has made satisfying the other debts is unclear, as \nhe provided no evidence supporting his contention that he has begun satisfying any of the \nother SOR debts after he satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 27, 2022 (Answer), and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2023. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on March 24, 2023, \nscheduling the matter for a hearing on May 9, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through H, without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record \nopen until May 23, 2023, and granted her an extension until July 6, 2023, so that she \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncould submit additional documentation. She timely submitted documentation that I \nmarked collectively as AE I and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on June 1, 2023.  \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant worked as a program area administrator \nfor a DOD contractor since 2012. She retired from employment in August 2023. Despite \nher retirement, \u00b6 4.41 of the Directive provides that jurisdiction in this matter continues \nsince the hearing was already completed.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. She is 66 years old. She married in 1980 \nand has been widowed since 2006. She has three adult children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1982. She has owned her home since 1987. (Tr. at 6-7, 25-27, 31; GE 1; AE \nA) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant worked as a program area administrator \nfor a DOD contractor since 2012. She worked only part time from 2014 to September \n2022, and then she worked full time until her retirement in August 2023. She also worked \nas a self-employed beauty consultant since 2011. She previously worked for the same \nDOD contractor beginning in 2002, except for a period of unemployment from \napproximately May 2009 to December 2009. She worked full time for a temporary agency \nfrom 2010 to 2012. She was first granted a security clearance in approximately 2006. (Tr. \nat 5, 7, 26-32, 42, 51-52, 59-61, 64; GE 1-3; AE A)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns, \nas required, for tax years (TY) 2011 through 2018, and that they remained unfiled as of \nthe date of the SOR. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleged that she failed to timely file her state \nincome tax returns, as required, for tax years 2011 and 2013 through 2018, and that they \nremained unfiled as of the date of the SOR. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) The SOR allegations are \nestablished by her admissions in her Answer; her 2020 security clearance application \n(SCA); her interviews with an authorized DOD investigator in 2020; and her 2021 \nresponse to interrogatories. (Answer; GE 1-3)  \nApplicant attributed her failure to file her income tax returns to the financial \nchallenges that began with the death of her spouse in 2006 and that continued when she \nbecame a caregiver for her parents and best friend. In 2008, she assisted her mother with \ncaring for her ill father until his death in 2011. To relieve some of her financial obligations \nafter his death, she began her home-based cosmetics business that year. The exhaustion \nof caregiving, the responsibility of managing her husband\u2019s estate, and her grief and \ndepression following his death hampered her ability to organize her supporting business \nreceipts and other necessary tax-related documentation. Her disorganization continued \nwith subsequent tax years, and she mistakenly believed that she needed to first file her \nolder income tax returns before she could file her more recent ones. She also suffers from \nattention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which further affected her ability to focus on details \nand important matters.

In 2020, Applicant\u2019s mother had \na stroke and Applicant cared for her mother until her death in 2022, shortly after she was \nalso diagnosed with cancer. After making the funeral arrangements and settling her \nmother\u2019s estate, she suffered from depression. As she slowly regained focus for her job \nand to begin to resolve her outstanding income tax returns, she briefly listed her home for \nsale, from around April 2022 to October 2022, to downsize. She ultimately took her home \noff the market due to the lack of interest and the change in market conditions. Her efforts \nwere further delayed when she caught COVID in October 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 37-39, \n42-43, 45-48, 55-57, 59-60; GE 1-3; AE C, G, I) \nApplicant assumed she was due tax refunds for the tax years in which she did not \nfile an income tax return because she never received any communication from the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding any tax liability. When she received notice from \nthe state tax authority that she owed state income taxes for TY 2012, she made monthly \npayments of $150 for 22 months, beginning in 2019, and she paid her outstanding state \ntaxes of approximately $5,926 for that tax year in 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 37-39, 42-43, 45-\n48, 55-57, 59-60; GE 1-3; AE C, G, I) \nIn approximately 2019, Applicant began working with a tax professional. With his \nassistance, she filed her federal and state income tax return for TY 2019 in October 2020, \nwith an approved IRS tax extension. She was due a federal and state tax refund of $22 \nand $651, respectively, for that tax year. In October 2022, the tax professional prepared \nher federal income tax returns for TY 2011 through 2018, however, he did so without the \nbenefit of her business expenses or a W-2 form to prepare her state income tax returns. \nShe had to compile such information before the income tax returns for those tax years \ncould be filed. (Answer; Tr. at 36-37, 44, 47-48, 53-59, 61-62, 67-69; GE 1, 3; AE C, G, I) \nUpon the advice of the tax professional, Applicant prioritized and filed her most \nrecent federal and state income tax returns, for TY 2020, 2021, and 2022, in April 2023, \nso that she could obtain the refunds to which she was due. She expected a federal income \ntax refund totaling $118 and a state income tax refund totaling $2,873 for those tax years. \nWith the help of the tax professional, she compiled her business expenses and filed her \n2011 through 2018 federal income tax returns in June 2023. She owed federal income \ntaxes totaling $10,681 for those tax years. Since this tax debt was not alleged in the SOR, \nI will not consider this evidence for disqualification purposes, but I may use it as it relates \nto credibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-person factors. She did not provide \ndocumentation reflecting that she filed her state income tax returns for TY 2011 and 2013 \nthrough 2018. She testified that the state tax authority had not contacted her concerning \nher unfiled state income tax returns. (Tr. at 32-36, 39-42, 44, 47-48, 53-59, 61-62, 67-69; \nGE 1, 3; AE C, G, I) \nApplicant\u2019s annual income as of the date of the hearing was approximately \n$70,000. When she worked only part time from 2014 to September 2022, her annual \nincome was approximately $60,000.

Since 2020, she \nhas worked to reduce her overall debt and improve her credit ratings. Her credit reports \nfrom 2023 reflect a \u201cvery good\u201d credit rating. She does not have any delinquent debts. \nThe tax professional provided her with financial counseling, in addition to helping her with \nher taxes. She stated that she lived modestly and within her financial means. She has \ndeveloped a system to stay on top of her business expenses and she intends to timely \nfile her future income tax returns. (Tr. at 27-30, 42-43, 48-53, 57-59, 62-63; GE 3-5; AE \nC, D, E, F, H, I) \nIn May 2022, an individual who served as Applicant\u2019s assistant supervisor for \nseveral years and supervisor for six months, described Applicant as a \u201cvery detail-\noriented person with high standards to get the work done in a professional manner.\u201d This \nindividual attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. In June 2023, \na work colleague of over 15 years also attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and strong \nwork ethic. (AE B, I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for TY 2011 through \n2018. She also failed to timely file her state income tax returns for TY 2011 and 2013 \nthrough 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. \nNonetheless, under AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly \nunder her circumstances. She did not begin working with a tax professional until 2019. \nAlthough this individual provided her with financial counseling in addition to helping her \nfile her income tax returns, she only recently filed her federal income tax returns for 2011 \nthrough 2018 in June 2023. Moreover, she owes federal income taxes totaling $10,681 \nfor those tax years. She also failed to provide documentation reflecting that she filed her \nstate income tax returns for TY 2011 and 2013 through 2018. She needs more time to \nestablish that she has her finances under control. I find that these financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. \nWithout objection, Items 3 through 7, and AE A through C, are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 33, is unmarried and has no children. She attended college from \napproximately August 2011 through April 2013 without earning a degree. She has been \nemployed as a correctional officer by her state since September 2022. She previously \nworked there from November 2016 through August 2021. The record indicates that \nApplicant had more than one sponsor associated with the SCA, which is her first \napplication for a security clearance. In her FORM response, she indicated that \nemployment with her current sponsor is pending the successful adjudication of her \nsecurity clearance. The interim security clearance she was granted sometime in 2021 \nwas withdrawn in about June 2022, presumably in connection with the issuance of the \nSOR. (Item 3; Item 5 at 17-18; AE A, C) \nApplicant worked in the retail and food service industry from February 2008 \nthrough November 2016. She was employed full time from February 2008 through \nOctober 2010 when she relocated to attend community college. She remained \nunemployed until she began a full-time position in March 2012, which she left in January \n2015 for a reason identified as a \u201clocation change.\u201d Applicant began a part-time position \nwith Employer A at the beginning of May 2015 that continued until November 2016. She \nended a full-time position with Employer B at the end of May 2015. She was able to work \nconcurrently for Employers A and B in May 2015 because she worked her full-time \nposition in the mornings and the part-time position in the evenings. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2, \n5; AE C) \nThe record was confusing about Applicant\u2019s employment status between January \n2015 and May 2015. Applicant did not disclose Employer B in her SCA. During her March \n2021 security clearance interview (SI), she reported working for Employer B from May \n2015 through November 2016. However, in a May 2022 response to DOHA-issued \ninterrogatories, she indicated that the timeline she gave the investigator for Employer B \nwas incorrect, but only corrected the end date and not the start date. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2, \n5; AE C) \nThe record was also unclear about Applicant\u2019s employment status between August \n2021 and September 2022. Applicant provided a December 31, 2021 paystub indicating \nthat she had been employed by Employer C for several months. In her September 2022 \nFORM response, she reported a period of unemployment between about June and \nSeptember 2022. The record is otherwise silent on the issue. (Item 5 at 17-18) \nThe SOR alleged 25 debts, including a $7,398 car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), eight federal \nstudent loans totaling $23,978 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.h, and 1.l) and 11 medical accounts \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntotaling $3,561 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r \u2013 1.y). In her Answer, Applicant admitted \neach of the SOR allegations. \nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to each question about her financial record and did not \notherwise disclose any delinquent debts in her SCA. During her SI, she initially answered \n\u201cno\u201d to whether she had any financial delinquencies in the past seven years. After being \nconfronted by the investigator with debts from her February 2021 credit bureau report \n(CBR), which were also alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.y, Applicant recognized some \nof the creditors and disputed others. She admitted that she was notified about a week or \ntwo prior to the SI about SOR \u00b6 1.p but denied prior knowledge that any other debts were \nin delinquent status. (Item 3 at 29-30; Item 4 at 6-9) \nApplicant acknowledged the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a but did not consider it in \ndelinquent status because she had been paying $100 per month to the creditor. She \nintended to continue those payments until the debt was settled by her insurance \ncompany. The loan related to a car that was totaled in an August 2019 accident, which \nshe described as a 20-car pile-up on the freeway. She was not the cause of the accident. \n(Item 4 at 7, 8) \nApplicant acknowledged that she defaulted on the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.h and 1.l but did not indicate the circumstances of the default. She did not \nconsider the loans in delinquent status because she had been making payments via an \nautomatic payroll deduction, which was halted due to COVID-19. She referenced her \nwages being garnished, but the record did not otherwise establish that the deduction was \ninvoluntary. She planned to contact the creditor to investigate the status of her accounts. \nShe had no intent to default on her loans and planned to resume payments. (Item 4 at 8, \n10). \nApplicant denied that she was responsible for SOR \u00b6 1.i, which was a charge for \ndamage to the common area of her college dormitory. She attributed the damage solely \nto her roommates. She intended to dispute the debt the following day. She would only \npay the debt if she were required to do so. Any such payment would be done via a \npayment plan. (Item 4 at 7-8) \nApplicant denied any knowledge that SOR \u00b6 1.j was in collection status prior to the \nday of the SI. She attributed the debt to her sister\u2019s cell phone. Although Applicant\u2019s plan \nincluded her sister\u2019s phone, her sister apparently agreed to make the payments \nassociated with her sister\u2019s phone. Unbeknownst to Applicant, her sister lost the phone \nand fell behind with her payments. She planned to contact the creditor the following week \nto set up a payment plan to begin at the end of March. (Item 4 at 7) \nApplicant did not recognize the medical accounts or creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.o, \nand 1.r through 1.y. She denied having any delinquent medical accounts because she \nhad medical insurance and never received any bills for medical treatment. She \nrecognized that the SOR \u00b6 1.m creditor was the hospital to where she was sent via \nambulance following the August 2019 accident but denied owing them any money. As of \nthe SI, she did not have any then existing injuries from the accident.

She was not able to pay it right away nor had she previously \nknown how much she owed. She planned to contact the creditor the following week to set \nup a payment plan to begin at the end of March 2021. She attributed her delay in resolving \nthis debt to not being smart with her finances at the time. Applicant did not explain what \nshe meant by that statement. The record did not otherwise indicate that she had been \nirresponsible with respect to her finances. (Item 4 at 7) \nApplicant recognized SOR \u00b6 1.p as a carpet cleaning fee that she incurred at a \nformer apartment due to having a dog. At some point prior to the SI, she made a verbal \nagreement with the creditor to resolve the debt via monthly payments of $50, beginning \nat the end of March 2021. (Item 4 at 6) \nApplicant acknowledged that she had car insurance with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.q \nbut denied owing any delinquent balances because she made her monthly payments via \nautomatic payment. (Item 4 at 7) \nAfter discussing the debts with which she was confronted, Applicant affirmed that \nno other circumstances were involved besides those she explained. She characterized \nher financial situation as okay. She asserted that she was actively trying to improve her \nfinancial wellbeing. She had begun budgeting differently, obtained a new job, and working \na lot of overtime. She believed that these actions would allow her to avoid financial \ndifficulties in the future. She planned to resolve any legitimate debts and expressed her \nintent to provide financial documents to the investigator at a later date. (Item 4 at 8-9) \nAfter the SI, Applicant provided three documents to the investigator related to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.r. and 1.q. A February 23, 2021 letter confirmed that, because of her \ncooperation, the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor agreed to settle the debt for $7,500 to be paid in \nmonthly installments of $100, beginning February 26, 2021. A March 5, 2021 letter \nconfirmed that she agreed to pay $44.49 per month, beginning March 30, 2021, to resolve \nSOR \u00b6 1.r. The SOR \u00b6 1.q creditor confirmed via a March 12, 2021 letter that two $25 \npayments were scheduled to be paid on March 30, 2021 and April 30, 2021. The record \ndid not address whether the two payments were part of a larger settlement or resolved \nSOR \u00b6 1.q in full. (Item 4 at 12-14) \nThe CAF issued interrogatories to Applicant on January 11, 2022. In response, \nshe explained that she fell behind on bills due to \u201cperiods of times in my life where I fell \non hard times;\u201d and asserted, \u201cI am able to work a job that will allow me to pay my debts \noff in a timely manner.\u201d She included in her response three documents, including a \nduplicate of the SOR \u00b6 1.a. letter previously provided to the investigator. A December 31, \n2021 paystub showed a $1,954 net pay for the period of December 13, 2021 through \nDecember 26, 2021, and a $6,837 year-to-date net pay for an unspecified period.

(Item 4 at 2) \nIn her Answer, Applicant stated that she had been making consistent payments to \nreduce the balance of debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a to $5,000 and continued to work with the agency \nshe hired in January 2022 to dispute the $2,265 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.i. She \nasserted that the agency helped her dispute and delete from her CBRs the $1,881 \ncollection account in SOR \u00b6 1.j, the $840 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.n, and $758 \nmedical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. She claimed that the $735 collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.p \nwas \u201cpending dispute,\u201d and that the nine medical debts totaling $1,865 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and \n1.r through 1.y were no longer showing on her CBRs. She did not proffer any documents. \nNor did she provide an explanation or status update concerning her student loans, the \n$938 medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, or the $388 car insurance account in SOR \u00b6 1.q. She \nconcluded by stating: \nI am dedicated to working on paying off my debt and understand that it is \nnot just necessary to keep my security clearance but to better myself. My \njob is my livelihood and how I am able to maintain and continue to work on\npaying off my debt. I take pride in the work I do and would like to continue \nfor as long as I can. \n \nIn her September 2022 FORM response, Applicant acknowledged that she \ndefaulted on some of the payment plans she established and fell behind on some bills \ndue to her recent period of unemployment (from approximately June 2022 through \nSeptember 2022) caused by the withdrawal of her interim security clearance. She did not \nprovide further details. She obtained a new job to help her catch up on her bills and \nresume her payment plans. She continued to engage the services of the agency that she \nhired in January 2022 to assist her. She provided a September 3, 2022 letter that \nconfirmed the SOR \u00b6 1.a creditor received payments totaling $1,600, which reduced her \nbalance to $5,900 and that her next scheduled payment was due on September 30, 2022. \n(AE A-C) \nA February 2021 CBR confirmed each of the SOR debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, \n1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q were reported on her January 2022 CBR. The 2021 CBR indicated \nthat the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r went to collections after the 2019 \naccident, while those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s. through 1.y went to collections before the accident. \nThe 2021 CBR noted Applicant\u2019s dispute of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.r. through 1.y; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe 2022 CBR noted Applicant\u2019s dispute of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.p. and 1.q.

(Items 6, 7) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe 2019 accident that totaled Applicant\u2019s vehicle was beyond her control. The \nrelated car loan was her largest single debt. Despite not being at fault in the accident, she \nresponsibly negotiated a settlement to repay the loan in February 2021. By September \n2022, she had made 16 $100 payments. Given the dates involved, the majority of the \nmedical SOR debts appear related to the accident. Those that went to collections before \nthe accident (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s. through 1.y) totaled only $129. \nApplicant had reasonable bases to dispute SOR \u00b6 1.i and all the medical SOR \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r through 1.y). Her roommates caused the damage \nfor which she was being charged. She had health insurance and never received any bills \nfor medical treatment. She took action to resolve these disputes. Although SOR \u00b6 1.i and \none of the medical debts (SOR \u00b6 1.m) appeared on her 2022 CBR, her disputes were \nnoted therein. Her dispute of SOR \u00b6 1.i was also noted on the 2021 CBR. \nApplicant did not proffer any bases to dispute SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.n, or 1.p. She accepted \nresponsibility for repaying her cell phone bill regardless of the agreement she had with \nher sister. She acknowledged that she owed past-due rent when she broke her lease and \na carpet cleaning fee due to having a dog. During the SI, she expressed an intent to \nresolve each of these debts. In fact, she set up a payment plan for SOR \u00b6 1.p prior to the \nSI. However, she did not proffer any evidence that she made any payments towards these \ndebts. \nDefaulting on any loan is security significant. The fact that Applicant defaulted on \nher federal student loans is of particular concern because she is seeking to gain a DOD \nclearance, which is a federal benefit. I, sua sponte, took administrative notice of the fact \nthat, beginning March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of \nEducation has been providing emergency relief for federal student loans, including the \nsuspension of loan payments and collections on defaulted loans. On August 24, 2022, \nPresident Biden extended this COVID-19 relief through December 31, 2022. On \nNovember 22, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education announced an extension of the \npause on federal student loan repayment, interest, and collections, to sometime in 2023. \nThis pause mitigates Applicant\u2019s post-pandemic inaction on her student loans. However, \nshe acknowledged that she defaulted on her student loans prior to COVID-19. Because \nthe record was insufficient to establish that her pre-pandemic payroll deductions resulted \nfrom an involuntary wage garnishment, I consider them sufficient evidence of a good-faith \neffort to resolve her student loans. She has demonstrated, through her consistent \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments towards SOR \u00b6 1.a, that she will follow through with her promise to resume her \nstudent loan payments. \nThe record indicated that the agency Applicant hired in January 2022 is only \nassisting her with repairing her credit reports, not with paying debts or establishing \npayment plans. However, in addition to her budgeting differently and working overtime, \nthe fact that she sought assistance from the agency demonstrates her commitment to \nimproving her financial wellbeing. Moreover, her 2022 credit report revealed that, despite \nperiods of unemployment that may have impacted her ability to repay existing delinquent \ndebts, she avoided incurring any new debts and managed her current finances \nresponsibly. Both before and after the SOR was issued, she demonstrated a track record \nof responsible action that leads me to conclude that she will follow through with her plans \nto fully resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a and repay her student loans. I do not find the unresolved debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.n, and 1.p., which total $3,456, security significant considering the record \nas a whole. However, Applicant should be aware that, unless she has a reasonable basis \nto dispute a debt, the mere deletion of a debt from her credit report is not generally \nsufficient on its own mitigate the security concern associated with that debt. \nThe AGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay every debt \nalleged in the SOR, or to be debt free. Applicant implemented a plan to address the SOR \ndebts and has made meaningful progress implementing that plan. None of her debts \nresulted from irresponsible spending. I conclude that her indebtedness is under control, \nunlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt about her reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 49 years old, married and has no children. He graduated from high school in 1992. He owned a tow-truck business for a number of years. He did well until the market in which he conducted business became too saturated with competitor tow- truck drivers. He closed his business and began working for a U.S. Government contractor in June 2020 as a maintenance technician. He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. (Tr. at 20-23, 37-39; GE 1 at 8, 12-19, 21-23.) Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Government alleged that Applicant had failed to pay his Federal tax liabilities for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR 1.a). He owes approximately $90,908 in delinquent taxes. The SOR sets forth a second allegation stating that Applicant is indebted to his local tax authority in the approximate amount of $2,028 for delinquent taxes for TYs 2016 through 2021.

(Answer.) The Government was ready to proceed \non August 15, 2022. The case was assigned to me on August 22, 2022. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 3, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled via TEAMS video conference on November 3, \n2022. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I held the record open \nuntil November 17, 2022, to give Applicant the opportunity to supplement the record with \nadditional documentation. He timely submitted three sets of documents, which I marked \nas Applicant Exhibits (AE ) A through C. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non November 10, 2022. (Tr. at 13-18, 64.) \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant is 49 years old, married and has no children. He graduated from high \nschool in 1992. He owned a tow-truck business for a number of years. He did well until \nthe market in which he conducted business became too saturated with competitor tow-\ntruck drivers. \nHe closed his business and began working for a U.S. Government \ncontractor in June 2020 as a maintenance technician. He is a first-time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. at 20-23, 37-39; GE 1 at 8, 12-19, 21-23.) \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore \npotentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. The Government alleged that Applicant had failed to pay his Federal tax \nliabilities for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR 1.a). He owes approximately \n$90,908 in delinquent taxes. The SOR sets forth a second allegation stating that Applicant \nis indebted to his local tax authority in the approximate amount of $2,028 for delinquent \ntaxes for TYs 2016 through 2021. In the Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations. \nThe current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a Failure to pay Federal tax in the approximate amount of $90,908. While \noperating his tow-truck business, Applicant fell behind in tax year (TY) 2016 on his \nFederal taxes related to his business. He acknowledges that he tried to ignore the \nproblem, but his tax debts did not go away. Over the subsequent two years, his delinquent \ntax debt increased to at least $90,000 because he was not paying any withholding taxes \nor quarterly payments on his income from his business. As a first-time business owner, \nhe claims that he did not know what he was doing when it came to his tax responsibilities. \nIn 2020 he hired a tax consultant who negotiated with the IRS an expensive payment plan \nto pay the delinquent taxes monthly over a number of years. Applicant was dissatisfied \nthat his advisor did not seek a compromise of the debt that would lower his tax debt.

Applicant wants to contact the IRS and seek a settlement in compromise that he can \nafford. \nApplicant and his wife together earn $200,000, but they live in an area with high \nliving costs. They live paycheck-to-paycheck and have little left over after paying their \nmonthly expenses and debts. Applicant\u2019s debts include monthly payments of about $700 \ndue on a new vehicle he purchased in 2020 and payments on a loan used to purchase a \ncamping trailer. Applicant and his wife are increasing their credit-cards debts to pay their \nliving and very high commuting expenses. Applicant recognizes that he has \u201cto step up \nand dig [himself] out of this hole.\u201d With his wife\u2019s income and expenses, their net monthly \nincome after all expenses gives them insufficient funds to make any significant payment \non Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes. (Tr. at 23-24, 37-40, 49-50, 53, 57-59; GE 1 at 32-33; \nGE 2 at 3-8; GE 4 at 3; AE A.) \nThe IRS diverted a recent Federal tax refund for $11,748 to pay down taxes \nApplicant owes for TY 2016. His bookkeeper filed for an extension for the filing of his TY \n2021 tax returns. As of the hearing date, he was late in filing the tax return. He recognizes \nthat he has to complete and file the return. He believes he has overpaid his taxes and \nwould receive a refund if he did not have a debt to the IRS for back taxes. As an employee, \nhe has withholding taken out of every paycheck and does not expect to have increased \ntax problems in the future. Applicant\u2019s delinquent Federal income tax debt has not been \nresolved. (Tr. at 34, 41-43, 59; AE C.) \n1.b Failure to pay local taxes for TY 2016 through 2021 in the amount of about \n$2,028. Applicant asserts that he paid this debt in late 2021. After the hearing he provided \ndocumentary proof of payment. He may owe a small amount of current taxes, but he is \nnot delinquent on these taxes at this time. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 25-34; GE 2 at 11; \nAE C.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nBoth of these conditions have application under the facts of this case. Applicant has been \ndelinquent on paying his Federal income taxes since TY 2016 and his tax debt \nsignificantly increased in TYs 2017 and 2018. The evidence establishes that in 2021 he \nhas paid a relatively small local tax debt. These facts shift the burden to Applicant to \nprovide mitigation of the security concerns raised by his actions. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the above Guideline F mitigating conditions fully applies. In 2020 Applicant \nreceived counseling and assistance from a credible and legitimate source to negotiate a \npayment plan with the IRS, but he was unable to make the payments under the payment \nplan. The problem has not been resolved. Applicant has not since made alternative \narrangements with the IRS nor has he initiated a good-faith effort to pay his Federal tax \ndebt. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has unpaid Federal taxes of at least $91,000 dating back to the 2016-to-TY \n2018 period. His tax obligations arose in the first instance for reasons within his control, \nspecifically his failure to pay any withholding or estimated taxes out of the income he was \nearning operating his towing business. In 2020 a tax advisor negotiated a payment plan \nfor Applicant to repay his taxes over time, but Applicant could not afford to pay it due to \nhis other financial obligations. \nApplicant has taken no responsible steps since then to seek a resolution of his \ndelinquent taxes. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been \nresolved. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \neligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has not met his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 47, has been married since 2014. He has two sons, ages 15 and 17, and two adult stepsons. He graduated from high school in 1993. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since June 2013, and listed no periods of unemployment in his June 2021 SCA. He has held a DOD security clearance since approximately 2019. (Items 3, 4) The SOR alleged that Applicant has three delinquent consumer debts totaling approximately $21,910 and one delinquent $1,495 medical debt. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c; however, I construed his explanations for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as de facto denials, because he indicated these debts no longer appear on his \u201ccredit history.\u201d He denied SOR \u00b6 1.d.

On \nMay 17, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.

He has two sons, ages 15 and \n17, and two adult stepsons. He graduated from high school in 1993. He has worked for \nhis current employer, a defense contractor, since June 2013, and listed no periods of \nunemployment in his June 2021 SCA. He has held a DOD security clearance since \napproximately 2019. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has three delinquent consumer debts totaling \napproximately $21,910 and one delinquent $1,495 medical debt. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.c; however, I construed his explanations for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as de facto \ndenials, because he indicated these debts no longer appear on his \u201ccredit history.\u201d He \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Items 1-2) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems largely to purchasing his home in June \n2011. \n\u201cI bought [a] house [and] couldn\u2019t afford anything else so I started to charge \nthings and before I knew it I was to (sic) far behind to catch up, most of this \nis late fees and interest. I tried to work things out, but they wouldn\u2019t take $10 \na week they wanted $100s and I couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d (Items 3, 7) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was opened in 2004, and it was charged off in the \namount of $12,840 in November 2021. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was opened in \nAugust 2016, and it was placed for collection in the amount of $7,055 in December 2021. \nIn Applicant\u2019s November 2021 response to CAF interrogatories, he indicated he had not \npaid or resolved either of these debts. Neither debt appear on his August 2022 credit \nbureau report (CBR), but he provided no documentation demonstrating he paid, resolved, \nor disputed them. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 3-4) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was opened in October 2017, and it was placed for \ncollection in the amount of $2,015 in November 2021. In Applicant\u2019s November 2021 \nresponse to CAF interrogatories, he indicated that he had not paid or resolved this debt. \nIn his Answer, he admitted the debt, and it appears on his August 2022 CBR with an \noutstanding balance of $2,059. He provided no documentation demonstrating he paid or \nresolved it. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 4) \nThe medical account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was opened in October 2017, and it \nwas placed for collection in the amount of $1,495 in November 2021. In Applicant\u2019s \nNovember 2021 response to CAF interrogatories, he indicated that he had not paid or \nresolved this debt. In his Answer, he denied the debt and claimed the creditor \u201cdid not \nuse the proper medical code.\u201d This debt does not appear on his August 2022 CBR. (Item \n2; Item 4; Item 6 at 2-3; Item 7 at 4) \nIn November 2021, Applicant\u2019s annual salary was approximately $90,200, and he \nwas the sole income earner for his family. His net monthly remainder was $245 and did \nnot include payments toward the debts alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence in the \nrecord that he has received credit counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant has over $23,000 in delinquent debt. There is no evidence in the record \nthat he has experienced unemployment or another hardship, and his only explanation for \nhis financial problems is due to purchasing his home in 2011. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d do not appear on his most recent CBR; however, \naccording to Appeal Board jurisprudence, Applicant is responsible for providing \nreasonably available corroborating documentation to show debt resolution. The record is \nabsent any evidence of an effort by him to resolve his debts or prove that the outstanding \ndebts are not his responsibility. Accordingly, there is insufficient that he has acted \nresponsibly to resolve his financial issues. Nor is there evidence of a good-faith effort to \nrepay or resolve his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve his debts indicates his financial issues are an ongoing \nand continuing concern. Therefore, his behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. For the forgoing reasons, Applicant failed to \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He \ndid not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns or establish his eligibility \nfor a security clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He is 40 years old. He married in 2016 and divorced in 2018. He has one child. He earned his high school diploma in 2000. He served in the National Guard from 2002 to 2011, when he was honorably discharged. He attended college from 2015 to 2016 but did not earn a degree. He has worked for various DOD contractors since 2002, except when he worked part time for a university from 2005 to 2006. He was also unemployed from August 2007 to November 2007, and from July 2018 to October 2018.

He is 40 years old. He married in 2016 \nand divorced in 2018. He has one child. He earned his high school diploma in 2000. He \nserved in the National Guard from 2002 to 2011, when he was honorably discharged. \nHe attended college from 2015 to 2016 but did not earn a degree. He has worked for \nvarious DOD contractors since 2002, except when he worked part time for a university \nfrom 2005 to 2006. He was also unemployed from August 2007 to November 2007, and \nfrom July 2018 to October 2018. As of his December 2020 background interview, he \nhad worked as a desk manager for his employer, a DOD contractor, since May 2020. \nHe was first granted a security clearance in 2006. (Items 1-6) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant had four delinquent student \nloans totaling $11,082 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d); seven delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$6,518 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.k); $251 in child support arrears (SOR \u00b6 1.l); and two judgments, \nfrom 2011 and 2016, for $12,019 and $5,721, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m-1.n). The \nallegations are established by his admissions in his Answer, a March 2018 security \nclearance application (SCA), a December 2020 background interview, his responses to \ninterrogatories from August 2021 and April 2022, court records, and three credit bureau \nreports from October 2020 to February 2022. (Items 1-7, 9-11) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts primarily to his youth. He also incurred \nhis debts while attending school, during his periods of unemployment, or when he \nearned minimal income. He also cited his divorce as a contributing factor. He earned a \nminimal income when he was ordered in 2009 to pay $1,006 monthly in child support, \nand he could not always fulfill this obligation. His tax refunds have been intercepted \nyearly and applied to his child support arrears, and he intended to address his \ndelinquent debts after he resolved his arrears. (Items 2-5) \nA May 2022 payment summary reflects that Applicant has been paying his child \nsupport obligation in SOR \u00b6 1.l since at least July 2021. He stated that he paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.d, 1.j, and 1.n, and that he was paying SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.k, but he did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his claims. He did not provide any information \nabout the status of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, or 1.i. He stated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m are older \nthan seven years, and although he made attempts to address these debts, he did not \nfeel obligated to continue to do so as he expected them to be removed from his credit \nbureau reports given their age. (Items 2-5) \nApplicant\u2019s August 2021 personal financial statement reflects a net monthly \nincome of $3,076, and a net monthly remainder of $537 after expenses. It does not \nreflect payments to any of the SOR debts, except for his child support obligation in SOR \n\u00b6 1.l. The most recent credit bureau report from October 2022 does not reflect any \ndelinquent debts. There is no evidence that he received any credit counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying his \ndebts. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(d) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He has made payments to his child support obligation in SOR \u00b6 1.l \nsince at least July 2021, before the SOR. I therefore find that allegation in his favor. \nAlthough Applicant indicated that he paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.j, and 1.n, \nand that he was paying SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.k, he did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate his claims. He did not provide any information about the status of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.f, or 1.i. Moreover, he stated that he did not feel obligated to resolve the older \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m, and he intended to wait for these debts to fall off his credit \nbureau report. It is reasonable for an administrative judge to expect an applicant to \npresent documentary evidence showing resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). Merely waiting for a debt to drop off a \ncredit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s favor. See, e.g, \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). That some debts have dropped \noff an applicant\u2019s credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. ISCR Case \nNo. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016). He has not received financial counseling. I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old. He married in 2003 and has one child. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2010, except for periods of unemployment for three months in 2013 and from November 2011 to January 2013, when he worked for a commercial business. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since August 2019.

Applicant\u2019s counsel had represented him in the earlier hearing. \nI offered to recuse myself from conducting the present hearing and both sides stated on \nthe record they had no objection to me presiding over the present hearing. (Transcript \n(Tr.) 6) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h with explanations. \nHe denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. He married in 2003 and has one child. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1993. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2010, except \nfor periods of unemployment for three months in 2013 and from November 2011 to \nJanuary 2013, when he worked for a commercial business. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a federal contractor, since August 2019. (Tr. 17) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d alleged alcohol-related conduct from January 2007 \nthrough October 2009, which Applicant testified about during his 2012 hearing. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel stated he did not intend to rehash this information, standing on the \nprior testimony and findings of fact. (Tr. 22) I have incorporated my findings of fact for \nthose allegations from my earlier decision as stated below. They are verbatim from my \ndecision. (GE 6) The SOR allegations in the earlier decision are as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that in about January 2007, Applicant resigned from \nemployment because he had used a company laptop to view pornography while he was \nunder the influence of alcohol and on temporary duty with his employment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that after seven days of inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse in \nabout July 2007, Applicant declined to follow his treatment provider\u2019s advice to enroll in \nan intensive outpatient program (IOP). He did not attend the IOP until March 2008. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that in about September 2009, Applicant received inpatient \ntreatment for alcohol abuse for about 17 days. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged that in about October 2009, Applicant overindulged in alcohol \nduring a business trip to a foreign country and failed to attend any meetings during an \nentire week. He was fired from his job soon thereafter. \nThe following findings of facts below relate to the above allegations that were \naddressed during Applicant\u2019s first hearing and are also alleged on his later SOR. \nApplicant did not struggle with alcohol abuse until approximately 2006. Around that \ntime, his employer initiated an investigation into suspicious activity regarding Applicant\u2019s \ncompany\u2019s laptop computer. He was on administrative leave for six weeks until the \ninvestigation was completed. Specifically, the investigation involved Applicant allegedly \naccessing pornography on the computer. He admitted to surfing the web and accessing \nadult pornography. The investigation also revealed there were seven to eight personal \nphotos of a sexual nature on his computer. \nApplicant was devastated. While he was at home on administrative leave, he \nworried and began to drink alcohol during the mornings and afternoons. He was permitted \nto return to his work facility but could not have access to the government network. He \nbecame frustrated and continued to drink alcohol. In approximately December 2006, the \ninvestigation was completed. In January 2007, the results of the investigation determined \nthat Applicant was surfing the internet for adult pornography on his company computer, \nand there were some private personal photos also on the computer. His employer gave \nhim the option to resign or be terminated. He chose to resign. His wife was aware of his \ninappropriate use of his computer. \nApplicant looked for a new job and continued to drink alcohol. He was hired in \napproximately March or April 2007 and worked until July 2007. In June 2007, he was \nadvised that his security clearance was reinstated. During this period of time, he \ncontinued to drink alcohol, but stated his consumption was reduced. \nApplicant was aware at this point that his drinking had become problematic. He \nthought he needed professional help. He sought help from the county mental-health \ncenter for depression and alcohol consumption. He was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser. \nHe received some treatment but had to leave the facility because his health insurance \nwould not cover the cost of treatment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated he was aware that something in his life had to change, and in July \n2007, he received inpatient treatment at an alcohol treatment center and was diagnosed \nwith alcohol withdrawal and dependence. He voluntarily sought this treatment. The \nnormal course of inpatient treatment is 14 to 28 days. Applicant\u2019s health insurance would \nonly pay for eight to nine days. He was isolated from external factors while he was an \ninpatient, so he progressed through treatment. He was discharged and went back to work \nwith his former employer. He was told by the treatment counselor to participate in the \nfollow-up outpatient program. He attended a couple of Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings and some of the program\u2019s aftercare sessions, but he did not participate \nregularly or consistently in either. He casually began to resume drinking alcohol and did \nnot perceive he was having any problems. He stated he did not consume alcohol for two \nand half weeks after his discharge. \nFrom January 2008 to June 2009, Applicant received treatment from the state \npsychiatric services for depression and alcohol dependence. The treatment consisted of \na six-week IOP, follow-up meetings with a physician and weekly aftercare meetings. \nApplicant admitted he participated only intermittently and discontinued at some point \nbecause he was back at work. \nIn August 2009, Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol began increasing. He had an \nincident at work where he failed to report for two days without telling his customer or \nemployer. He stayed out of work for a couple of more days while he arranged to go back \ninto treatment. His wife was unaware that he was staying home and not going to work. In \nSeptember 2009, he received inpatient treatment again and completed the full course of \ntreatment. He resumed drinking casually around October 2009 when he and his family \nwent on vacation. In November 2009, Applicant and a coworker traveled to a foreign \ncountry to provide two weeks of training to that country\u2019s military. Applicant participated \nin the first week of training. He began drinking alcohol the second week and made \nexcuses to his coworker that he was not feeling well enough to work. He would stay at \nthe hotel during the day and continue to drink alcohol. His employer learned of his actions, \nand he was terminated. \nApplicant was depressed and drinking. In February 2010, Applicant stated he got \nseriously involved in his recovery. He began looking for a job. He resumed his attendance \nof AA meetings and was working with a sponsor a couple of times a week. He admitted \nto himself he had a serious problem with alcohol dependence. Applicant stated he did not \ndrink any alcohol from February 2010 until May 2011. \nIn late April 2011, Applicant\u2019s community experienced a devastating tornado. \nBecause they were without electricity, they cooked on outdoor grills. On May 1, 2011, \nthey learned that the terrorist Osama Bin Laden had been killed. His neighbor brought out \na bottle of alcohol to pass around as a toast in celebration. Applicant stated he took a \nswig from the bottle. He stated he did not really think about it. His old pattern of thought \ncame to him, and he thought perhaps it was okay to have a drink now and again. He \nwrestled with whether to tell his AA sponsor. He decided to tell his sponsor and recommit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto the AA program. He credibly testified at his first hearing that he had not consumed any \nalcohol since May 1, 2011. \nApplicant admitted that he was stubborn about his recovery. He finally got to a \npoint where he got tired of his struggle with alcohol. He chose to live a life of principles \nand sobriety. He had the support of AA, his family, and his friends. It was an ongoing \nprocess. Applicant stated at his first hearing that although he was not consuming alcohol, \nhe had to pay attention every day and be mindful of his recovery. He had accepted that \nhe is an alcoholic. He attended AA meetings a couple of times a week. He talked to his \nsponsor. He helped organize and participated in meetings at the treatment center where \nhe attended. At that time, he attended at least two AA meetings a week sometimes he \nattended three to five meetings, depending on his schedule. He completed the 12-step \nprogram of AA and was continuing to work through the steps again. As he got further \naway from his last drink there was less of a daily struggle, but he continued to be vigilant. \nHe said he was committed to staying sober each day. Applicant stated: \nI\u2019d like to give you 100 percent assurances that I will never take a drink \nagain. And I feel the chances are very close to that if I continue to do what \nI\u2019ve become comfortable with doing on a daily basis and, you know, \npracticing these principles. And I\u2019ve got a good support system both AA \nbased and family and friend based. And I feel confident about that. \nApplicant\u2019s wife became aware that his drinking was becoming problematic and \nhis consumption was increasing. She was supportive in his sobriety and attended a three-\nday program for family members of alcoholics provided by his treatment center to educate \nher on how to help him with his sobriety and recovery. She also attended Al-Anon when \nshe felt she needed the support. She believed Applicant had difficulties believing he was \na good husband and father, and so he would drink. She was convinced her husband was \ncommitted to sobriety. He made a commitment to be employed and was fully vested in \nhis efforts to change his ways. She believed he now realized how much he lost and was \nremorseful about his past actions. She believed because he knew how much he had to \nlose, he would continue to remain sober. She noticed a significant change in him since \nhe acknowledged his problems and committed to sobriety. She and her husband were \ncommunicating better. She supported him when he wanted to go to AA meetings and \nnever questioned him in that regard. (GE 6) \nThe following facts are from Applicant\u2019s recent hearing. In his March 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed his 2007 seven-day inpatient alcohol \ntreatment and his 2008 six-week IOP follow-up for alcohol abuse. He further disclosed \nhis September 2009 inpatient alcohol treatment and counseling for 17 days. He disclosed \nthat in August 2019, he completed a 21-day inpatient alcohol and treatment counseling \nprogram and a follow up IOP for 12 session, each lasting three to four hours. He reported \nongoing attendance at a follow-up continuing care meeting once a week for an hour and \nthat he is participating in a 12-step recovery program.

He said that \nin 2014, his AA sponsor passed away and he did not obtain a new sponsor. In 2016, he \nstarted drinking again. From spring 2016 to October 2018, his alcohol consumption \nprogressed to where he was drinking daily. He testified that he was drinking daily between \na \u00bd pint and a fifth of liquor. He testified that he struggles with his drinking when he has \nchallenges. He would occasionally drink in the morning but would then not go to work. He \nwould sometimes stay away from work for a couple of days. He would occasionally leave \nwork early so he could drink. He would not drink at home. He said things had gotten very \nbad at work because his drinking was affecting his motivation. His wife was not aware of \nhis drinking. He would hide his liquor in the garage. (Tr. 25-27, 79-86; GE 3, 7) \nIn October 2018, he recognized he needed to get back on track with his sobriety. \nHe voluntarily enrolled in a four-day detoxification program. He told the investigator that \nhe was sober for about two months. He said he thought he just needed the detoxification \nprogram and a new AA sponsor, and he would be back on track. Applicant admitted at \nhis hearing that he left the detoxification program early. Post-hearing, he later clarified \nthat it was because his insurance would only authorize payment for four days. He was \nencouraged by the staff to stay, but he left against their medical advice. The discharge \nsummary notes that he did not want to stay in the program beyond the four days. He said \nhe was leaving due to commitments to family, work, and his long-term AA program outside \nof the medical facility. In December 2018, he went on a cruise and started drinking again. \nHe began increasing his alcohol consumption and frequency and by August 2019, he was \nconsuming alcohol daily. He continued to hide his drinking from his wife and lie to her. He \ndid not think there was any specific stressor going on in his life at the time that prompted \nhim to drink. (Tr. 27-31, 76-77, 88-95, 100-101; GE 3, 4, 7; AE K) \nApplicant told the investigator that in August 2019, he decided the four-day \ndetoxification program he participated in October 2018, did not work. Applicant voluntarily \nenrolled in a 21-day inpatient alcohol treatment program. He told the investigator that he \nsuccessfully completed the program and a follow-on outpatient program, which involved \n12 sessions, each lasting three to four hours. He also participated in continuing care once \na week and AA meetings twice a week. He said he had not consumed alcohol since \nAugust 2019. He said he felt like he was back where he needed to be and it was not a \nstruggle or an issue to remain sober. He had not participated in any additional alcohol-\nrelated counseling or treatment at that time. (Tr. 32-33, 87; GE 7) \nApplicant testified that after August 2019 he had an AA sponsor and stayed sober \nuntil November 2020, when he was preparing a meal and one of the ingredients was red \nwine. He took a gulp of the wine. He said within seven days he had progressed to daily \ndrinking. He estimated he was drinking between a pint and a fifth of bourbon daily. He \nwas in a state of depression and despair. He had been participating in AA but started to \nslack off. He entered alcohol treatment and was in a 21-day inpatient treatment program. \nHe did not contact his AA sponsor when he started to drink again but waited until he was \nadmitted into the inpatient program.

He testified \nabout what has changed. He said he is now plugged in with AA and is consistent with his \nattendance. His 2020 treatment was organized differently, and he is now with a group of \nmen around his age. He felt there was a deeper sense of the spiritual side of recovery, \nwhere he is more focused. He is following the 12-step AA program and is being \nresponsible as a trusted servant. He is now more active in the program and serves in \ndifferent positions, including being a chairman for monthly business meetings. He said he \nis also a sponsor for three others who reach out to him. He attends 3 to 5 meetings per \nweek and in the past attended 7 to 12 meetings a week. He provided attendance sheets \nfrom his AA meetings to corroborate his meeting attendance from December 2020 to \nJanuary 2023. (Tr. 39-44, 99, 105; AE J) \nApplicant acknowledged that he cannot give 100% assurance that he will not drink \nin the future. He acknowledged he has a disease and that if he consumes one drink it will \nset off a cycle of destructive behavior. He is not sure if he consumes alcohol again if he \nwill be able to recover and that scares him. He has a responsibility to his family and his \nemployer, which he takes seriously. He said he has the support of his family, friends, and \ncoworkers who know he is working on his sobriety. (Tr. 42-46, 56, 107-108) \nApplicant testified that in 2005 he was prescribed Norco, a painkiller, by his family \ndoctor, due to a sciatic problem with his back. The prescription is to take one tablet twice \na day as needed for pain. In the last five years, he estimated he takes it about two to three \ntimes a week on average and only if Ibuprofen does not work. He will usually take half a \ntablet, but if the pain is severe, he will take the full tablet twice a day, as prescribed. He \ncredibly testified that he does not use it for any other purposes. He knows that as an \nalcoholic it could be dangerous with his brain chemistry. He said that he has never felt a \ncompulsion to attempt to increase its effect. He stated that alcohol is one thing and opiates \nare another. He disputed that when he was admitted for alcohol treatment in 2019 that he \nsaid he took more Norco than was prescribed. He stated what he told the medical staff \nwas that he took more than he usually takes, but not more than was prescribed. He is \naware drugs and alcohol do not mix and he does not use them beyond what is prescribed. \nApplicant has not discussed his alcoholism with his family doctor. Applicant\u2019s doctor who \nprescribes the medication provided a written statement regarding Applicant\u2019s use. He \nconfirmed Applicant has used it for many years, and he does not have any concern that \nhe is abusing it. I found Applicant\u2019s statement credible that he did not exceed the \nprescribed dosage. (Tr. 51-55, 59-74; AE D) \nApplicant participated in a psychological evaluation by a government-employed \npsychologist, Dr. F, in August 2021. The interview lasted approximately eight hours and \nwas conducted in person. Dr. F provided a detailed narrative that for the most part \ncoincides with the facts of Applicant\u2019s past alcohol abuse. Dr. F diagnosed Applicant with \nmajor depressive disorder, recurrent, exacerbated by grief/loss in sustained remission; \nand alcohol use disorder, severe in sustained remission.

His prognosis is good, and Dr. F did not find Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse would \nhave a negative impact on his reliability, stability, judgment, or trustworthiness. (Tr. 47-\n50; GE 3) \nApplicant participated in a one-hour Zoom evaluation by a government-employed \npsychologist, Dr. B, in February 2022. Applicant said he told Dr. B that he had been \nevaluated in August 2021, and she told him that this evaluation must be a follow-up check-\nin conversation. Dr. B described Applicant as evasive. He answered her questions and \nwas not sure how much detail she wanted because he was told it was a wellness check. \nDr. B indicated she gave Applicant the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) test and \nthe validity scales indicated he was consistent in his responding, and did not attempt to \nover or under report symptoms or behaviors that individuals commnly admit to. However, \nshe found that certain aspects of the profile raise the possibility of denial problems with \ndrinking and drug abuse. Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, severe; \nmajor depressive disorder, recurrent, unspecified severity; generalized anxiety disorder; \nopioid disorder; tobacco use disorder; pornography addiction R/O, which means rule out. \nShe did not find Applicant truthful during the interview She derived her diagnostic \nimpressions primarily from her clinical judgment and medical record review. She found \nApplicant may be unreliable or untrustworthy, impulsive, engage in dangerous activities, \nor take unnecessary risks and his prognosis is poor. (Tr. 47-50; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified. She has tried to support her husband. She believes he \nhas been sober for more than two years and is actively participating in AA. His drinking \nhas been stressful on their marriage. In the past, she was confident that he would maintain \nhis sobriety, but believes this time he is dedicated and committed to it. She has never \nobserved him abuse Norco and does not believe he abuses it. She believes he has a \ndisease that only he can control. He is a good man and wants to do the right thing. She \nhas known he is an alcoholic since about 2006. Most of the time he would not divulge to \nher he was drinking. He would not tell her the truth about his drinking. She would bring \nhis drinking to his attention and remove the alcohol from the house, but she could not \nstop him. (Tr. 110-122) \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor testified on his behalf. He has been his sponsor for about \nthree or four years. He said Applicant is doing great and attends a lot of meetings. They \nget together about once or twice a month and see each other at meetings. He believes \nApplicant\u2019s sobriety is solid and he is a man of integrity. Applicant has followed his AA \nplan, but has stumbled when he relapsed in 2020. Since then, he has been in compliance. \nApplicant has sought assistance from his sponsor. (Tr. 123-130) \nA character witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has held a security \nclearance for 25 years. He was Applicant\u2019s supervisor who fired him in 2009 when he was \ndrinking on a work trip in a foreign country. He was offered an opportunity to rehire \nApplicant for a specific contract and chose not to because he wanted to see how he was \nperforming elsewhere. A couple of years later, he noted a change in Applicant and \nbelieved he was in a good spot and was low risk. He rehired him in July 2019.

(Tr. 24, 131-141) \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer testified on his behalf. They have worked \ntogether since 1998. She is aware of the concerns about his issues with alcohol. He has \nbeen upfront with her and self-reported his issues. When he went back into treatment in \nNovember 2020, he talked to her about it. She believes he is a person of integrity. He is \nprofessional and meticulous in his work. She does not have concerns about his \nalcoholism. (143-148) \nCharacter letters were provided from Applicant\u2019s sister and longtime friend. He is \ndescribed as intelligent, reliable, dependable, and beloved. They believe that Applicant is \ntotally committed to his sobriety this time because he is immersed in AA and more active \nand determined. (AE H, I) \nApplicant provided his employee performance evaluations for 2020, 2021, and \n2022. He is consistently evaluated in the different performance categories as excellent \nand outstanding. (AE A, B, C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \nApplicant received treatment for alcohol abuse and was diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence after he received inpatient treatment at an alcohol rehabilitation facility \nseveral times from June 2007 to September 2009. Excessive alcohol consumption \nimpaired his judgment. He failed to show up for work due to his alcohol abuse and was \nterminated. While on a business trip to a foreign country he consumed alcohol and failed \nto do his job. \nIn October 2018, Applicant was hospitalized as an inpatient for alcohol abuse. He \nwas diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. In about August 2019, he was \nhospitalized for 21 days as an inpatient for alcohol abuse treatment and another 12 days \nfor IOP. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. In November 2020, he was \nhospitalized for about 21 days for alcohol abuse. Government psychologists evaluated \nhim in 2021 and 2022. Both diagnosed him with alcohol abuse disorder, severe. Dr. B \nopined that his mental health issues could make him unreliable, untrustworthy, impulsive \nand that he may engage in dangerous activities and take unnecessary risks. His \nprognosis was poor. The other Government psychologist found his prognosis was good \nand did not have the same concerns. There is sufficient evidence to apply all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith nay required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant continues to struggle with his alcoholism. He relapsed after treatment \nnumerous times. He repeatedly commits to his sobriety and abstaining from alcohol \nconsumption only to become lax and fall back into his same pattern of drinking. Although \nhis wife supports his sobriety, he hides his drinking and lies to her about it. He has an AA \nsponsor with whom he has been with for several years, but he has had a sponsor in the \npast and still continued to relapse. Het is an active participant in the AA program, which \nagain he has been in the past. During his 2012 hearing, he said he attended meetings \nand took on leadership roles in AA, which he testified that he is doing again since \nrecommitting to the program. During his first hearing, he explained that he was now fully \ncommitted to his sobriety. I found him credible in 2012, and I believe each time he fails, \nhe recommits himself. I found Applicant credible in his earnest attempt to remain sober. \nAt his first hearing, he had been sober 19 months. He was given a second chance and \ngranted eligibility to access classified information. \nIn 2016, Applicant resumed drinking and in October 2018, he participated in a \ndetoxification program. Shortly after completion, he resumed drinking in December 2018. \nHe participated in a 21-day inpatient treatment program in August 2019, followed with a \n12-day IOP and resumed drinking in November 2020. He is participating in AA and says \nhe has been sober since November 2020. He believes that this time he will be able to \nremain sober. Although alcoholism is a disease and his body reacts to it in a negative \nway, it does not impede Applicant\u2019s ability to make a choice about whether to drink or not. \nHe repeatedly makes the wrong choice. Based on the frequency of Applicant\u2019s past \nalcohol abuse and conduct, not enough time has passed to conclude future problems will \nnot recur. AG \u00b6 23 (a) does not apply. \nApplicant has acknowledged his alcohol use and his actions to overcome the \nproblem. I have no evidence that Applicant is participating in any program except AA, \nwhich is an acceptable program. It appears he is following the program, but again without \na significant long period of sobriety, I cannot find that any of the remaining mitigating \nconditions fully apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder. \nI have considered all of the evidence and conclude that there is insufficient \nevidence that Applicant misused the painkiller he was prescribed. I found Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible that he usually took less than prescribed and when he explained he \ntook more, he meant it was more than he usually took, not more than prescribed. I have \nconsidered the statement from his prescribing physician that Applicant has been in \ncompliance and that of his wife who has not observed him abuse the drug. I have also \nconsidered Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis and did not find it as probative as the totality of the \nevidence. The above disqualifying conditions do not apply, and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor \nunder this guideline.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and H in my whole-person analysis. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. I find in his favor for Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Department Counsel provided a six-page summary of the\nfacts, supported by five Government documents pertaining to Pakistan, identified as HE\nI. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative\nnotice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters \nof general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the \nFindings of Fact. \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born in \nSaudi Arabia to Pakistani nationals. Applicant has been employed with the defense \ncontractor since March 2019. He is married to an American citizen and has no children. \n(GX 1 at pages 5, 14 and 28~29.) Applicant came to the United States in about 2014, \nand obtained a Master\u2019s Degree from an American university. (TR at page 15 line 7 to \npage 17 line 3.) \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n1.a. Applicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Pakistan. His \nmother\u2019s family lives in the United States, and she \u201chas a Green Card.\u201d She has \u201calways \nbeen a housewife.\u201d Applicant\u2019s father has an open visa for entry to the United States. \nHe\u2019s a retired 75-year-old \u201cHuman Resources Manager.\u201d He worked for a government \nagency for about \u201ctwo years before he retired. Before that, Applicant\u2019s father was a \nbanker, and before that he worked for \u201ca construction company.\u201d (TR at page 17 line 6 \nto page 19 line 11.) \n1.b. Applicant\u2019s \u201cmuch older\u201d brother is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. He is a \nLieutenant Colonel in the Infantry. Their contact is limited to about once a year. (TR at \npage 19 line 20 to page 20 line 23, and Answer at pages 6~7.) \n1.c. Applicant has two other brothers and one sister who are citizens and \nresidents of Pakistan. One brother \u201cworks in real-estate,\u201d and the other is unemployed. \nHis sister \u201cis a homemaker.\u201d TR at page 20 line 24 to page 22 line 21.)

(Answer at page 7.) \n1.e.~1.g. In an \u201cabundance of caution,\u201d Applicant listed six cousins on his \nsecurity clearance application (e-QIP), who are all citizens of Pakistan, but two reside \noutside of Pakistan, one in the United Arab Emirates, and the other in Qatar. Applicant \nhas little or no contact with his cousins. (TR at page 25 line 9 to page 35 line 20, and \nAnswer at pages 7~8.) \nNotice \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Pakistan: Pakistan is \nan Islamic Republic. The Department of State has assessed parts of the country to be \nMEDIUM or HIGH-threat locations. During 2021, there was a lack of government \naccountability, and abuses, including corruption, that often went unpunished, fostering a \nculture of impunity among perpetrators, whether official or unofficial. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, five siblings and numerous cousins are citizens of Pakistan. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s mother has a green card, and his father has a standing visa to visit \nthe United States. She is a housewife, and he is 75-year-old retiree. Applicant has little \ncontact with his siblings, and little or none with his cousins. Foreign Influence is found \nfor Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace and in his community. (AppX B.) Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Foreign Influence security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

An SOR was included that reported numerous delinquent debts supported by credit reports. The SOR noted that Applicant was aware of most of the delinquent accounts and was unable to pay them. The DON CAF issued a Final Denial of Eligibility for Security Clearance letter in June 2012. (GE 6) Applicant testified that he resolved his outstanding debts while serving in the military. He said he has held a secret security clearance since approximately 2012. He completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2021.

I have attached \nboth to the record and will refer to AE Q for substantive evidence. There were no \nobjections to the exhibits. They were admitted in evidence and the record closed. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on July 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, and 1.e. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.d. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married in 2012 and divorced in 2021. He has a child \nfrom the marriage and shares joint custody with his ex-wife. He served in the military from \n2011 to 2016 and was honorably discharged. He has taken college courses but does not \nhave a degree. He has worked for a federal contractor since May 2020. (Tr. 21-26, 28, \n80; GE 1) \nIn December 2011, Applicant received a letter of intent to deny eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance from the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON \nCAF). An SOR was included that reported numerous delinquent debts supported by credit \nreports. The SOR noted that Applicant was aware of most of the delinquent accounts and \nwas unable to pay them. The DON CAF issued a Final Denial of Eligibility for Security \nClearance letter in June 2012. (GE 6) \nApplicant testified that he resolved his outstanding debts while serving in the \nmilitary. He said he has held a secret security clearance since approximately 2012. He \ncompleted a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2021. In it, he disclosed he was \ndischarged from the military in August 2016 and started a part-time job the same month \nand worked until June 2017. He then left this employment to accept a full-time position. \nHe disclosed he worked full time until February 2018 and left this position because his \nmother was sick. He worked full time from February 2018 to April 2019 and disclosed he \nleft this position because he was \u201cabout to move after mother died.\u201d He worked part time \nfrom April 2019 to May 2020 before being hired by his present employer. He did not \ndisclose any periods of unemployment on his SCA. (Tr. 11, 25, 29, 46; GE 1) \nApplicant also disclosed in his SCA that as part of a background check to obtain a \nsecurity clearance in 2012 while serving in the Navy, he was investigated by the DOD. \nHe stated \u201cI was in sub school.

He \ntestified he died on the day Applicant started his job. He stayed in the job for about four \nmonths until April 2017. His mother was hospitalized in 2017. In May 2017, he moved \nback home to take care of her. She passed away in March 2018. Applicant testified that \nwhen he moved home, he did not have a job. He said he chose to be unemployed for \nnine months from May 2017 to March 2018. These dates are inconsistent with the \ninformation he provided on his SCA. (Tr. 30-36; GE 1) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his period of unemployment while \ncaring for his mother. At the time, he was receiving $400 to $500 a month from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) for disability. He said when his father died, his mother \nreceived survivor\u2019s benefits and Social Security payments. His father did not have life \ninsurance and they had no savings. He also attributed his financial problems to his \ndivorce, but acknowledged he was responsible for the debts alleged. (Tr. 36-40) \nApplicant testified that after his mother passed away, he started working in April \n2018 as an apprentice aircraft mechanic at a military base. He left federal employment \nwhen he was hired in March 2020 by his present employer where he earns more. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony of his employment dates is inconsistent with his SCA. (Tr. 40-44; \nGE 1) \nAs part of his background investigation, Applicant was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in October 2021. He told the investigator that his financial \nstruggles began when his father passed away in January 2017, and he felt responsible \nto care for his mother and help her continue the lifestyle she had been accustomed to. \nHis financial struggles worsened when his mother passed away in early 2018. He \ninherited his parents\u2019 house, where he was living, and assumed the financial responsibility \nfor the mortgage payments. In his answer to the SOR, he said since his parents passed \naway \u201cI\u2019ve just been trying to maintain what\u2019s back home. I gave my whole life up to come \nback home to try [and] buy [the] house and keep the land looking good just like they \nwanted.\u201d He testified that after his parents passed away, his goal was to buy their house. \nHe continued to make the mortgage payments. He testified that his goal is to purchase \nhis parents\u2019 house and maintain his credit and to do that he must take care of his debt. \n(Tr. 51-54, 79; GE 2; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant disclosed to the investigator that he had a credit-card account that he \nused for daily necessities. He recalled to the investigator that the balance at some point \nwas over $10,000. He said he would contact the creditor to make payment arrangements. \nWhen asked if he had more than one account with the creditor, he could not recall. He \nwas confronted with a second credit-card account, and he confirmed it belonged to him. \nHe said he used both credit cards to pay daily expenses, bills, and necessities.

The two credit card-accounts are \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($18,660) and 1.b ($17,899). \nApplicant testified that he began accumulating credit card debts in about 2017. He \nsaid his wife was using the cards, but he also was using them. The credit cards are in his \nname only. Applicant testified that he made payment arrangements for the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with the creditor. He provided a letter from the creditor dated May \n31, 2023, stating it confirmed a payment arrangement to begin in June 2023 to pay $25 \na month and it referenced the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided undated documents to \nshow he made payments presumably on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b (based on the balance \nowed) in the amounts as follows: $165, $150, $15, $120, $30, $90, and $75. He testified \nthat he had a previous payment agreement from May 2022 and made payments, but he \ndid not keep track of them. He did not provide a copy of this agreement. He said he was \nmaking payments \u201con and off.\u201d He testified that he had been making consistent payments \nonce he received the SOR. He said his agreement was to make two monthly payments \non each account for a total of four $25 payments a month. He provided a document dated \nJune 10, 2023, from the creditor referencing the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a and its receipt of \n$25 with a remaining balance of $18,430. It did not reference a payment agreement for \nthis debt, only a payment. Post-hearing, he provided a document to show the current \nbalance on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b had decreased and was now $17,614. (Tr. 46-52, 8185-\n87, 89-95; AE B, C, S, T, V, W) \nApplicant was confronted with the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,457). He \nexplained to the investigator that this charge was used to purchase furniture and the \noriginal balance was about $4,000. The account became delinquent in 2017 when he was \ntraveling to visit his father in the hospital and sometimes, he was only working three days \na week. He told the investigator he intended to satisfy the balance. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that four years ago he contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c and contacted them again a year before receiving the SOR and made them an offer \nto settle the debt. After receiving the SOR, he contacted the collection creditor but was \nadvised that the statute of limitations had run on the collection of the debt. He said he \ncontacted the collection company and offered to make payment arrangements or settle \nthe debt. He provided a copy of a letter he sent to the creditor. He provided copies of \nthree checks each for $15 paid to the creditor in June and July 2022.1  (Tr. 60-67; AE G, \nJ) \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with the collection account alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($233). He told the investigator this was a utility bill for his residence that he \noverlooked paying when he moved home to be with his mother in 2018. He intended to \n1 In Applicant\u2019s exhibit list he labeled AE G as payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. AE G includes three \nchecks drafted from his credit union that is also the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The checks are made out to the \ncollection creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c not the creditor in \u00b6 1.a.

In his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided proof that the collection account was \npaid in January 2022. (Tr. 67-68; GE 2; Answer to the SOR; AE H) \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with the charged-off account in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e ($2,249). He told the investigator that he had purchased a wedding ring for his wife. \nHe said the original balance for the account was $5,000. He had been paying on the \naccount but when his parents passed his priorities shifted. He intended to satisfy the \naccount. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he has a payment agreement with the creditor for the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e to pay $50 a month on the collection account. The letter he provided states: \n\u201cThis letter is to confirm your offer to make a voluntary payment arrangement and your \nauthorization on 05/06/2022 of recurring transfers from your bank account.\u201d (emphasis \nadded) He provided documents that show on May 10, 2022, and May 23, 2022, his \nautomatic transfers were $23.43 and on June 22, 2022, his transfer was for $23.19. It \nappears these transfers were automatic. He did not provide documents to show he \ncontinued these automatic transfers. He testified he stopped the payments because he \nwas paying other bills. He then provided documents from the creditor beginning in \nJanuary 2023 that do not reference an automatic transfer but reference a voluntary \npayment of $25 that was to be electronically debited. He provided proof he made two \npayments of $25 in January 2023, and then one monthly payment of $25 through April \n2023, and two payments of $25 in May and two $25 payments in June 2023. (Tr. 69-76, \n97; AE D, E, F, Q, R) \nApplicant told the investigator that he was able to make payments on his accounts \nand satisfy his debts. He intended to contact the creditors and make payment \narrangements. At that time, he was not on a payment plan with any of his creditors. He \ntold the investigator that his financial stability improved when his VA disability was \napproved for 100% in March 2021, and he was working full time for his present employer. \n(GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he earns approximately $46,000 annually from his \nemployment. His said his VA disability rating was increased in April 2022 to 100% and he \nnow receives $3,971 a month ($47,652 annually). He also testified his VA disability began \nin January 2022. His testimony as to the date his VA disability increased differs from what \nhe told the investigator, that is March 2021. He provided a document from the VA, but it \ndoes not show the date he began receiving the increased payment. (Tr. 44-46, 87-89; AE \nP) \nApplicant testified he does not have a budget. Post-hearing, Applicant provided a \npersonal financial statement from July 2023. He reports he has $1,300 in expendable \nincome after he pays his bills. He lists two credit cards that are current with a total balance \nof approximately $18,000 that he makes monthly payments of $250 on each. He also lists \nhis mortgage of $1,220 a month.

In 2022, he gave the truck to his teenage son. He \nestimated his monthly expenses for the truck are $180 for the loan, $400 for insurance, \nand $280 for gas. He explained \u201cI got him the truck because I couldn\u2019t get him a new truck \nlike his friends got. So I was able to give him something, though, and things like that just \nso he can be happy.\u201d He pays $540 for child support but anticipates this amount may \nincrease due to the new amount for his disability payments. He also expects his child to \ngo to college. He believes his military benefits will cover many of the expenses, but there \nwill likely be additional ones not covered. (Tr. 54-60, 82-85, 100-103) \nApplicant was asked if he had filed his federal income tax returns on time and paid \nif he owed taxes. He stated he had not filed on time in the past five years but did file late, \nand he was sure he owed taxes. He stated his tax balance had increased. He made two \npayments of $25 to the IRS, and he did not have a payment plan. He said he plans to pay \nhis tax debt and now that he has 100% VA disability he will be able to pay. Post-hearing, \nApplicant provided a document presumably from the IRS website that shows Applicant\u2019s \n2022 tax year balance is $582; 2021 tax year balance is $1,820; and 2020 tax year \nbalance is $806. (Tr.109-115) \nApplicant provided a document to show he took an online quiz from a credit \norganization that tested his current understanding of credit reports. It stated that when he \ncompleted the end of the course, he should take the post-quiz and receive his Document \nof Achievement. It is unclear whether the scores presented in the document are pre-quiz \nor post-quiz. There were ten questions and Applicant answered eight correctly and the \ntime taken to complete it was two minutes and eight seconds. A Document of \nAchievement was not provided. (AE I) \nApplicant provided character letters that describe him as responsible, assertive, \nindependent, hard-working, kind, loyal, mature, reliable, valuable, professional, honest, \nintelligent, disciplined, productive, and a team player. (AE K) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes but may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions, in a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to a period of unemployment when he was \ntraveling in 2016 to see his father before he passed away in January 2017, and when he \nwas caring for his mother before she passed away in March 2018. He also attributed it to \nhis divorce. These were conditions that were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must show he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant stopped paying legitimate bills, lived off of his credit cards, and \nmade the choice not to work for nine months. Although it is understandable that he felt a \ncompelling need to be with his mother, he failed to act responsibly regarding his debts \nafter she passed away. He was made aware that his debts were a security concern when \nhe completed his SCA in May 2021 and when he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator in October 2021. He indicated to the investigator that his VA disability rating \nwas increased to 100%, and he was in a better financial situation. At that time, he \nindicated his intent to contact creditors and make payment arrangements. He did not \nbegin to address most of his debts until after he received the SOR. He made a payment \nagreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e to make recurring automatic payments. He did \nthis for a couple of months then stopped. He resumed six months later. He said he had a \npayment agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to resolve both debts. The \ndocuments reflect that only the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is part of the plan that began in May \n2023 to pay $25 a month. I have considered he made sporadic payments. One of his \ndebts is now barred by the statute of limitation. It has been five years since his parents \npassed away. There is insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant acted responsibly. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) only partially applies. \nApplicant\u2019s debts may have originally occurred under unique circumstances, but \nhis failure to address them and take meaningful action raises a concern. Based on his \nfinancial history, I cannot find they are unlikely to recur. His failure to address his debts \nor contact the creditors when he said he would casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant may have participated in some type of credit counseling, there \nis insufficient evidence to conclude his financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \nhas minimal application. \nApplicant provided proof he has made some small payments to his creditors. He \nprovided proof that he resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d but it was four years overdue. One \ndebt is now barred by the statute of limitations. Based on the minimal amount of his \npayments on large debts despite having expendable income, the short period of time he \nhas made payments, his delay in addressing the debts, and his inconsistent payment \nhistory, AG \u00b6 20(d) has minimal application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and disability. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s devotion to his parents during their last stages of life. However, Applicant has \nan overall poor financial track record, including his failure to timely pay his federal income \ntaxes. Based on his minimal efforts since 2018, I am not confident he is committed to \nresolving his legitimate debts. I find Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has worked for various DoD contractors at an \noverseas location since 2015. He served on active duty in the United States Army from \n2007 to 2010, separating with a general under honorable conditions discharge. He is \ndivorced and has no children. (GE 1-2; Tr. 11, 17-18, 26) \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement \nApplicant admitted using marijuana with varying frequency from October 2009 to \nJanuary 2010. (SOR \u00b6 1.a, Response to SOR) He also admitted using marijuana with \nvarying frequency from July 2014 to February 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.b, Response to SOR) In \nApril 2010, he was discharged from the U.S. Army with a discharge characterized as \ngeneral under honorable conditions due to a positive urinalysis for THC, and marijuana \nuse. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: GE 9) \nAfter his discharge from active duty, Applicant was arrested on three occasions \nand charged with drug-related offenses to include: \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: \nFebruary 2015 arrest for Use/Possession Drug Paraphernalia; \nUse/Possession Marijuana. Applicant failed to appear in court and a warrant was issued. \nThe case was nolle prossed, with prejudice in May 2018.

He failed to appear in court and a warrant was issued for his arrest. \n(GE 2 at 19-20; GE 6) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he first used marijuana at age 12. It was \na one-time experimental use. He did not use marijuana again until he was deployed to \nIraq in 2009. He was deployed to Iraq from approximately July 2008 to October 2009. \nAlthough Applicant admitted the use of alcohol and marijuana was prohibited in Iraq by a \nGeneral Order, several of his fellow soldiers were drinking alcohol to blow off steam. He \nwas a driver and decided it was better to use marijuana instead of alcohol even though \nhe was aware marijuana use was prohibited. He estimated he used marijuana at least \nonce a month while deployed. (Tr. 18-19, 70-71) \nUpon his return from deployment, Applicant continued to use marijuana while on \nactive duty. He smoked marijuana in social settings, at parties, and in the park. He \nestimated his level of use was on a weekly to monthly basis.

In February 2010, he \nwas ordered to attend ASAP (a drug counseling course the Army provided), but was \nseparated from active duty before its completion. (GE 2 at 15. Tr. 19-20) \nAfter his separation from active duty, Applicant did not use marijuana until July \n2014. He smoked marijuana on a monthly basis until February 2021. He stopped using \nmarijuana when he applied for his current job because he did not want to fail the drug \ntest. Between 2015 to 2021, Applicant worked for several DoD contractors. He was asked \nwhether he recalls signing a drug policy document with each employer which states that \nillegal drug use is prohibited. Subject told the background investigator conducting his \nsecurity clearance investigation that he knew marijuana use was against policy, but \nthought his use was not hurting anything since he never used marijuana at work. He \nstopped using marijuana in hopes of being granted a security clearance. He claims he is \nnot dependent on marijuana and is able to stop using it. He testified during the hearing \nthat the last time he used marijuana was in November 2022. I am going to use the \nNovember 2022 date as the last time he used marijuana. (Tr. 22-25, 74; GE 2 at 16) \nApplicant admits that he was arrested in February 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) but was not \nsure what the charges were. He claims the police were looking for his brother. His brother \nwas not home, so Applicant was arrested because the police discovered grinders and \npapers. Applicant denies that he possessed marijuana. He did not appear in court. He \nreturned overseas to work. He claims that he was not aware of the outstanding charges \nuntil he came home on vacation and was arrested for having open arrest warrants. (Tr. \n26 -30; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant admits he was arrested in June 2015, but denies that he possessed \nmarijuana or illegally possessed prescription drugs. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) He was driving with Mr. \nM, a close friend. The car he was driving belonged to his mother\u2019s friend. A police car \ndrove in the opposite direction and noticed Applicant was driving without a seat belt. As \nApplicant pulled into the driveway of Mr. M\u2019s house, the police approached their car. A \nsubsequent search of the car revealed prescription pills. He does not recall marijuana \nbeing found in the car. He and his friend were arrested, booked, and spent 24 hours in \njail. He posted bond. He was given a court date, but went back overseas to work before \nthe court date. He failed to appear and a warrant was issued for his arrest. (Tr. 32, GE 2 \nat 18-19; Answer to SOR; GE 5) \nFinally, Applicant admits he was arrested in May 2018 but was not sure where the \nmarijuana charges came from. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) He was home on leave to attend his sister\u2019s \ngraduation. He had several open bottles of alcohol in the car which were left over from \nthe graduation celebration. He was driving back from the celebration. A woman who he \nhad just met on-line was in the car with him. He believes she may have possessed \nmarijuana. He denies possessing marijuana.

He claims he tried to put the correct information into the e-QIP, but the program \nwould not allow it. He states he never tried to hide his marijuana use. (Tr. 57-61)  During \nhis background investigation interview, Applicant told the investigator that he did not list \nthese events on his case papers because he thought they would reflect negatively on \nhim. (GE 2 at 20)  \nWhole-Person Factors \nApplicant provided several character references attesting to his good character. \nMr. R., Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor, has worked with Applicant over the past two years. \nThey no longer work on the same team, but he describes him as \u201ca trustworthy, motivated, \nand hard-working young man.\u201d (AE A at 1) Ms. N.B. is Applicant\u2019s close friend and \nneighbor. She has known Applicant for the past 14 years. She states Applicant has \nconsistently shown a commitment to \u201cintegrity, leadership, altruism, trustworthiness, \nreliability, accountability, and hard work, as well as being a great friend that always has \nan open ear to listen.\u201d (AE A at 2-4) Applicant\u2019s sister, a former co-worker, and a friend \nwho served with him on active duty also provided favorable letters attesting to his good \ncharacter. (AE A at 5 \u2013 7) Applicant also received a certificate of appreciation for his \nsupport of the Army\u2019s mission. (AE A at 8)  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nan October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws prohibiting \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state can authorize \nviolations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state law (and \nthe laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the national \nsecurity adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law concerning \nthe use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making eligibility \ndecisions for sensitive national security positions.  \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b)  testing positive for an illegal drug; and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession \nof drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant has a lengthy history of illegal marijuana use. He used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from October 2009 to January 2010 and from July 2014 to November \n2022. He was discharged from the U.S. Army because of a positive urinalysis test. \nBetween February 2015 to May 2018, he was arrested three times in the U.S. The \ncharged offenses for each arrest included the charge of possession of marijuana. AG \u00b6 \n25(a); AG \u00b6 25(b); and AG \u00b6 25(c) apply. \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long history of marijuana use continues to be a security concern. He \nused marijuana ranging from a weekly to a monthly basis. He used marijuana although \nhe was aware that it was against DoD policy and unlawful. He decided to stop using \nmarijuana in February 2021 because he was applying for a security clearance, yet he \nused again in November 2022 while his security clearance adjudication was pending. His \ndecision to use marijuana, an illegal drug, on a regular basis over a long period of time \ncannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather a pattern of behavior that \nreflects his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations. Security clearance decisions are \nnot limited to conduct during duty hours. Off-duty conduct, especially where it reflects \npoor judgment, provides a rational basis for the government to question an appellant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. \nDepartment of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed \na disregard for the law, regulations, and the fiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered \ninto with the Government. \nApplicant\u2019s assertions that he has stopped using illegal drugs since November \n2022 are insufficient to overcome the concerns with respect to his past drug involvement. \nAt this time, he did not demonstrate a lengthy enough pattern of abstinence, given the \ncircumstances under which he chose to use illegal drugs. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and \nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant illegally used marijuana from October 2009 to January 2010, and July \n2014 to November 2022. He was arrested on three occasions and charged with \nmarijuana\u2013related offenses in 2015 and 2018. These occurred while he was employed \nas a DoD contractor overseas. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), and 31(b) are established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 describes two conditions that could mitigate security concerns in \nApplicant\u2019s case including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nCriminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure \nto appear in court related to his marijuana-related offenses, resulted in warrants being \nissued for his arrest. The warrants for his arrest remain outstanding. His criminal issues \nare not resolved because of his decision to flee to his job overseas rather than dealing \nwith the criminal offenses in the U.S. While Applicant\u2019s co-workers think highly of him, \nthere is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation because of the outstanding \nwarrants, and Applicant\u2019s decision to continue to illegally use marijuana up until \nNovember 2022. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f. These allegations were \nappropriately considered under the drug involvement and criminal conduct concerns. For \nthis reason, I find SOR \u00b6 3.a for Applicant. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his answers on his June 30, 2021, \nSCA about his criminal arrests in response to Section 22 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b \u2013 3.c) and his \nillegal marijuana use within the past 7 years in response to Section 23. (SOR \u00b6 3.d) I find \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. Applicant deliberately omitted his three arrests and his illegal \nmarijuana use. During his background investigation interview on April 13, 2022, he told \nthe investigator that he did not list any of his arrests because he thought they would reflect \nnegatively on him. Applicant claims the e-QIP program would not let him input the relevant \ninformation. I don\u2019t find this information credible. \nIn response to Section 22, Applicant was required to disclose his illegal use of \nmarijuana within the last seven years. In other words, his illegal marijuana use from June \n30, 2014, to June 30, 2021, the date he completed his security clearance application. He \ndid not do so, even though he later admitted he used marijuana on a weekly or a monthly \nbasis between 2014 to February 2021. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. While Applicant disclosed his arrests and illegal \nmarijuana use during his background investigation interview in August 2021, he did not \nprovide the information until the background investigator asked him about the issues. The \ndisclosures were not prompt. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nfalsifications were not minor and continue to raise doubts about his reliability, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(e) applies. Applicant\u2019s eventual disclosures \nabout his arrests and illegal drug use reduced his vulnerability to be exploited, \nmanipulated or under duress. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his arrests and his illegal drug use within \nthe past seven years raises issues about his honesty and trustworthiness. The security \nconcerns raised under personal conduct are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, J and E in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nI also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, including the \nstatements from his friends and co-workers, and his work history as DoD contractor. The \nunfavorable evidence raises concerns that outweigh the favorable evidence. Applicant \nhas a long history of illegal marijuana use. His illegal marijuana use resulted in his \ndischarge from the U.S. Army. While he stopped using marijuana for several years after \nhis discharge, he resumed using marijuana in 2014 on a regular basis. He only stopped \nusing marijuana in February 2021 because he was applying for a security clearance. He \ncontinued to use marijuana in November 2022. The issues involving his marijuana-related \narrests in 2015 and 2018 are unresolved because of his deliberate failure to appear. His \ncriminal warrants remain outstanding. He was less than forthcoming about these issues \non his June 2021 security clearance application. \nApplicant did not mitigate security concerns raised under drug involvement, \ncriminal conduct, and personal conduct. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b -3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

(Tr. 35-36) When he first sought help, he was drinking four or \nfive days a week and about \u201ca few glasses of wine [and] a half a pint of vodka.\u201d (Tr. 36) \nApplicant said on January 4, 2012, Dr. L advised him to decrease his alcohol \nconsumption. (Tr. 37) She said he was supposed to \u201cslow down at the very least\u201d on his \nalcohol consumption. (Tr. 37) Dr. L did not tell him to abstain completely from alcohol \nconsumption. SOR \u00b6 2.d alleges and Applicant admits that on August 28, 2012, he told \nDr. L that he continued to consume alcohol, and Dr. L recommended he receive \nsubstance abuse counseling. In August 2012, he was consuming a pint of alcohol four \ntimes a week. (Tr. 38; GE 3 at 116) At his hearing, he said he did not remember that Dr. \nL recommended that he obtain substance abuse counseling.

(Tr. 40) Dr. L. prescribed Campral for him; however, he did not continue taking it \nbecause he was worried it would make him sick if he drank alcohol. (Tr. 41) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges and Applicant admits that he received inpatient treatment from \nOctober 14 to October 16, 2013, for renal colic and alcohol abuse.

(Tr. 42) He did not remember meeting \nwith Dr. K; however, he accepted that the meeting and diagnosis occurred because it is \nin his medical record. (Tr. 42-43) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g alleges and Applicant admits that on March 31, 2016, he told Dr. F he \nincreased his alcohol consumption.

(Id.) Dr. F diagnosed him with Alcohol Abuse, encouraged him to join \na substance abuse support group, and advised him to abstain from alcohol consumption. \n(Tr. 45; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6 2.j alleges and Applicant admits that on February 28, 2020, Dr. S diagnosed \nhim with Alcohol Abuse, Acute alcoholic gastritis without hemorrhage, and Hepatomegalia \n(enlarged liver), likely resulting from his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 46; SOR response) \nHowever, at his hearing Applicant said he did not remember the Hepatomegalia \ndiagnosis, and recent tests showed his liver was normal. (Tr. 46) Dr. S encouraged him \nto reduce his alcohol consumption and to join a substance abuse support group. He was \nprescribed benzodiazepines to reduce withdrawal symptoms, until complete cessation. \nAt his hearing, he said he remembered being prescribed benzodiazepines; however, he \ndid not remember being advised to stop drinking alcohol. (Tr. 46) \nIn his SOR response, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.k, which alleges that he continued \nto consume alcohol contrary to treatment recommendations described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.e, \n2.f, 2.g, 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j, supra. For SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant said Dr. L recommended that \nhe reduce his alcohol consumption and not that he cease all alcohol consumption. For \nSOR \u00b6 2.j he did not remember being advised to stop drinking alcohol. \nFrom 1999 to about 2006, Applicant drank alcohol to help him cope with anxiety. \n(Tr. 34) He received medication which helped with his anxiety. (Tr. 34) His alcohol \nconsumption gradually increased, and it peaked around 2015 or 2016. (Tr. 35) He \nstopped drinking alcohol around May of 2021, except for occasional sips from other \npeople\u2019s drinks. (Tr. 47, 49) He completely stopped drinking alcohol in about 2021 or \n2022.

The SCA asked him in the previous seven years: whether \nhe had consulted with a health-care professional regarding an emotional or mental-health \ncondition; and whether alcohol had a negative impact on his professional and personal \nrelationships. His SCA also asked whether he had: ever been ordered, advised, or asked \nto seek counseling or treatment because of his use of alcohol; and ever sought counseling \nand treatment because of his use of alcohol. Applicant answered, no, to these four \nquestions. \nApplicant understood the questions on his SCA. (Tr. 59) He did not disclose his \nhistory of mental health and alcohol treatment on his SCA because he did not think it was \nan issue for him or in the alternative, he said he did not remember why he did not disclose \nthe requested information.

(Tr. 22-23)    \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;   \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f). \nAdditional discussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption contributed to his decision to take about \n10 Xanax in February 2015. He has a history of repeatedly consuming alcohol to \nintoxication. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. He failed to follow treatment \nrecommendations from Dr. L in 2012, from an alcohol treatment facility in 2013, from Dr. \nF in 2016, and from Dr. K in 2017, to reduce or abstain from consumption of alcohol. After \nsome reductions of his alcohol consumption, he resumed his alcohol consumption at \nsignificant levels.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He reduced his alcohol consumption in 2021 to 2022 to \na low level, and he stopped consuming alcohol about one year ago. He has never been \narrested or convicted of any alcohol-related offense. There is no evidence of security \nviolations, use of alcohol or impairment at work, or abuse of illegal drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and the possibility of renewed alcohol \nconsumption to the extent of intoxication and poor decisions casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. More time without alcohol consumption in \naccordance with treatment recommendations is necessary to reduce security concerns. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply, and Guideline G security concerns are not \nmitigated at this time. \nPsychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, \nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, \nchronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c) are established. See also USAF-M Case No. 23-\n00056-R at 5-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2023) (discussing interrelationship between alcohol-\nrelated security events and application of AG \u00b6 28(a)). AG \u00b6 28(d) is not alleged in the \nSOR, and AG \u00b6 28(d) will not be considered as a disqualifying condition. Additional \ndiscussion of the disqualifying conditions will be included in the mitigation section, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant was hospitalized after consuming about a pint of vodka and overdosing \non Xanax in February 2017. On February 1, 2022, a psychologist, Dr. G, diagnosed \nApplicant with Alcohol Use Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, and Depressive \nDisorder, unspecified. He said Applicant was defensive about his alcohol consumption, \nand he concluded Applicant exhibits issues with reliability and trustworthiness which may \nimpair his ability to protect classified information. His evaluation observed that a March \n2017 treatment note states, \u201cHis history of drinking included one pint of vodka daily or \nmore for nine years. He had a history of blackouts. His longest period of sobriety was \nseven days in 2016 due to pain in the abdomen.\u201d (GE 2 at 4) Dr. G said his mental health \nconditions pose a significant risk to his judgment and stability in the future unless he \nobtains treatment and maintains sobriety. \nApplicant did not provide a recommendation from a treatment provider, \npsychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other health-care practitioner that his \nidentified condition: (1) is readily controllable with treatment; (2) is amenable to treatment; \n(3) was temporary and the situation has been resolved; (4) is under control or in \nremission; (5) is not a current problem; or (6) has a favorable prognosis. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) \nthrough 29(e). He is not currently receiving alcohol or mental-health treatment or \ncounseling beyond renewal of prescriptions. There is no schedule of planned \nassessments to determine his current mental-health status. He receives support from \nfamily; however, family and his former spouse\u2019s support are not listed in the mitigating \nconditions for psychological conditions.  \nBecause of the interrelationship between his history of alcohol consumption and \nhis mental health issues, I cannot rule out a recurrence of an episode of poor judgment. \nAs discussed in the previous section, his alcohol consumption raises serious security \nconcerns. Not enough time without alcohol consumption or with responsible alcohol \nconsumption in accordance with treatment recommendations has elapsed. I have \nlingering concerns that Applicant will again be under stress or suffering from anxiety, will \nagain resume alcohol consumption, and then he may make poor security-related \ndecisions. Psychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies and will be addressed in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused\nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with\nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the\nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual\ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone,\ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the\nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.

Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nApplicant admitted that he failed to disclose requested information on his \nDecember 14, 2016 SCA. This SCA asked him in the previous seven years: whether he \nhad consulted with a health-care professional regarding an emotional or mental-health \ncondition; and whether alcohol had a negative impact on his professional and personal \nrelationships. This SCA also asked: whether he had ever been ordered, advised, or asked \nto seek counseling or treatment because of his use of alcohol; and whether he had ever \nsought counseling and treatment because of his use of alcohol. Applicant answered, no, \nto these four questions. \nApplicant said he understood the questions on his December 14, 2016 SCA. He \nwas unsure about his rationale for not disclosing the information; however, he suggested \nthat at the time he completed his SCA he did not consider the information to be a \u201cbig \ndeal.\u201d He failed to honestly and candidly disclose negative information on his SCA. When \nhe answered no, he knowingly and intentionally provided false information with intent to \ndeceive. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines G, I, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old information technology specialist. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer for about one year. In 2003, he received an associate degree in \ncomputer networking. He was married from 2008 to 2017. His former spouse and \nsupervisor positively described his character, and their statements support approval of \nhis access to classified information. There is no evidence of criminal offenses, drug \nabuse, violations of his employer\u2019s rules, or security violations. \nThe evidence against granting Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is more \npersuasive. Applicant has a history of binge-alcohol consumption. In 2017, Applicant \nconsumed an excessive amount of alcohol and overdosed on Xanax. On February 1, \n2022, Dr. G diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol Use Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, \nunspecified, and Depressive Disorder, unspecified. He said Applicant was defensive \nabout his alcohol consumption, and he concluded Applicant exhibits issues with reliability \nand trustworthiness which may impair his ability to protect classified information. More \nimportantly Applicant was not candid and truthful when he completed his December 14, \n2016 SCA. He did not disclose his history of recommendations, treatment, and counseling \nfor mental-health and alcohol-consumption issues. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Guidelines G, I, and E security concerns are not mitigated \nat this time. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

In the Answer, Applicant admitted that her primary care physician works at the \nmedical center and provides refills of the prescriptions she has been given by a \npsychiatrist at the center. She explained further that she has not sought psychiatric \ntreatment or psychological counseling since 2015 due to her psychiatrist\u2019s opinion that \nshe has managed her mental health well since 2015 by complying with her medication \ntreatment. She takes her medications \u201clike clockwork.\u201d She does not currently receive any \ncounseling, but she would not hesitate to seek counseling if she needed it.

In her evaluation of Applicant, the DoD Psychologist diagnosed her with \nMajor Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, in full remission; other specific trauma and \nstressor related disorder; and History of Attention Deficit Disorder, combined type. The \npsychologist concluded that despite Applicant\u2019s current status of being in remission, her \ndiagnosis creates a risk of impaired judgment and reliability.

She wrote: \n[Applicant\u2019s] mental health history was tumultuous for many years with the \nlast bout of psychiatric treatment being in 2013. She relates much of these \ndifficulties to an abusive relationship with her father and to a lesser extent, \nstressors of a failed marriage and raising a child with Asperger\u2019s.\n \n \n \n \n  \n* \n*\n* \nIn 2015, she cut ties with her abusive father. Since then, she has done \nexceptionally well to the point that I have managed her medications since \n2015 and she no longer needs to see a psychiatrist. She has been \ncompletely stable with no exacerbations. She is medically compliant and \ncomes in regularly for her prescriptions. [Applicant] has excelled in her \nemployment with more responsibilities and promotions. Additionally, she is \na single mother and has raised a son, [name deleted], who is now 19. \n \n \n \n*\n*\n* \nI have no reservations in recommending her for reconsideration of her \nsecurity clearance. \n(AE A.) Applicant has also had a recent mental-health evaluation by a psychologist, who \nis a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy Medical Services Corps and holds a Top \nSecret clearance (Evaluator). The Evaluator had reviewed the DoD Psychologist\u2019s Report \nwhen he interviewed Applicant. (Tr. at 38-43, 62.) \nThe Evaluator wrote in his report, dated February 22, 2023: \n[Applicant] appears to have [made] significant efforts in remediating her \npsychological issues such as distancing herself from her parents, applying \nherself in her career, maintaining lawful behaviors, and staying compliant \nwith her treatment recommendations and medication regimen. These \nbehaviors and interventions have resulted in a remission of many of her \npreviously identified issues that appear to have been sustained over several \nyears. The diagnoses below attempt to capture the Subject\u2019s current level \nof functioning as well as acknowledging her history as it pertains to this \nevaluation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Evaluator provided the following diagnosis: \nDIAGNOSIS: \nADHD, combined type (F90.2) \nPersistent depressive disorder, with anxious distress, in full remission (F34.1) \nPosttraumatic stress, resolved (F43.10) \nOpioid use disorder, moderate, in full remission (F11.20) \nAnxiolytic use disorder, severe, in full remission (F13.20) \nIn his conclusion, he wrote: \nThe chaotic presentation that occurred between the years of 1997 and 2016 \nwould certainly have resulted in an adverse outcome, had she been \nevaluated then. However, since that time, it appears that she has made \nsignificant improvements across all major areas of her life; personal, \nprofessional, and relational. As a result of these actions, and her \ncompliance with medical treatment, she appears to have mitigated the worst \nof her symptoms which would have prevented a favorable recommendation. \nThere does not appear to be any current evidence of disqualifying \nsymptoms or behaviors and she has exhibited stability over the \ncourse of at least 6 years. She has maintained compliance with her \nmedical treatment team and does not appear to have any reservations \nabout utilizing them when complications arise. Lastly, there does not appear \nto be any concerns from her professional references about her ability to \nperform in her required duties. As such, this Evaluator believes that the \nSubject\u2019s judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness are currently \nintact. \n(AE O at 8 (emphasis added.)) \nMitigation \nApplicant has received multiple recognitions and new positions since starting to \nwork for her current employer in 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counselling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nThe record evidence establishes both of the above potentially disqualifying \nconditions. This evidence shifts the burden of proof to Applicant to mitigate the security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 29 lists the following three conditions that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from the opinion of the DoD Psychologist and Applicant\u2019s history of \nhospitalizations: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAll of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s condition has proven \nover the last six years to be readily controllable with treatment, and she has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with her treatment plan. She has presented a recent \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by the U.S. Government \nthat Applicant\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation. The record evidence establishes that there is \nno indication of a current problem. Applicant has satisfied her burden to establish \nmitigation of the security concerns raised by her past experiences with mental health \nissues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant\u2019s success in managing her past mental health issues is \nmost clearly evidenced by her successful employment record in recent years, and in \nparticular her success working since 2021 for one of the largest and most important U.S. \nGovernment contractors. She could not have achieved that success had she not taken \ncontrol of her life in 2015 by cutting off ties with her abusive father and begun the journey \nto become her own person with the help of a competent medical team that has found the \nbest medications for her condition. She appreciates the importance of her medication \ntreatment and follows it \u201clike clockwork.\u201d She has overcome her difficult mental health \nissues and is now a living a successful and meaningful life. Overall, I have no questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

He admitted he was aware it was a \nviolation of rules, regulations, and procedure to purchase THC products while possessing \na security clearance. He told the investigator that he knew that he could not purchase any \nillegal drug or have any involvement with illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. \nHe said that when he saw the THC products while in California, his thought process was \nthey were legal in California and legal in the state where he had a layover and legal in the \nstate where he was going, so he thought it would be okay to purchase THC as gag gifts \nfor his friends. He said that the latter part of his thought process overtook the part of him \nholding a security clearance at the time. He acknowledged that he made a poor and wrong \nchoice, and it would not happen again. (Item 5) \nGovernment interrogatories were sent to Applicant, and he was provided a \nsummary of his interviews with government investigators. In June 2022, he made several \nchanges to the summary before indicating it was an accurate reflection of his interview. \nHe did not correct the record or provide an explanation about his failure to disclose to the \ngovernment investigator his prior drug use from 2009 to 2012. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted his marijuana use from 2009 to \n2012 and that he purchased marijuana in November 2018. He stated: \u201cI did something \nthat I was absolutely not supposed to do and that it was dumb and dangerous.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant denied that he failed to provide accurate information to the investigators. He \nsaid, \u201cAt no point did I believe the information I had reported on a previous e-QIP for an \nincident that had occurred more than 7 years prior to the current investigative process \nwas relevant to the investigation.\u201d He further stated, \u201cAt no point did I falsify any \ninformation because I accurately reported that I could not comment on how drugs affected \nmy behavior as my body and mind had matured in the 8 years since the previous incident.\u201d \nHe also said, \u201cI had tried to ask the interviewer to elaborate so that I could more accurately \nunderstand the scope of what he was asking, as I believed it was a trick question designed \nto get a response contradicting the incident in subparagraph 1.b, which I was just \nquestioned about.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant never referenced his inability to understand the question that the \ninvestigator was asking during his previous interviews.

He said: \nI did not immediately think to recall how I felt answering each question \nduring the long and intensive interview. Instead, I opted to mention an \naddress change as I have moved nearby at some point during the \nadjudicative process. Even if I thought that this is what the \u201cadditional \ninformation\u201d was referencing, I would not begin to understand the scope \nbeing asked. . ..\u201d (AE A)  \nApplicant\u2019s FORM response notes that when he completed his 2020 SCA he did \nnot report his 2009 to 2012 drug use because it was outside the seven-year time frame. \nHe decided that because the drug use was outside the seven years he did not have to \ndisclose it in his 2020 SCA or during his subsequent investigative interview. Applicant \nsaid he did not falsify material facts during his October 2020 subject interview. He did not \nprovide an explanation for why when he was specifically asked by the investigator about \nhis prior drug involvement, he said he had ----\nnever used THC and he could not comment \non how drugs affect his behavior.  \nApplicant further stated that \u201cat no point did I contradict any of what was previously \nreported.\u201d He emphasized that he had self-reported the 2018 purchase and transportation \nof THC, which is indicative of his honesty. He said he has been cooperative, and he is \ntrustworthy. He said he is aware that his conduct was \u201cdumb and dangerous\u201d and made \nhim vulnerable to exploitation and there is not an excuse for his actions. He believes he \nis trustworthy because he self-reported his purchase and transportation of THC. He \nindicated this was an isolated incident. He has not been involved in any security violations. \nHe said he is praised for his work performance. \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s statements and explanations credible. I find he deliberately \nfalsified material facts during his personal subject interview on October 10, 2020, with an \nauthorized investigator with the Department of Defense when he stated he had never \nused THC and could not comment on how drugs affected his behavior. \nApplicant stated in his FORM response the following: \nI take my job and national security very seriously. At work I have been \npraised numerous times for my performance on my project that involves \nclassified information. The information that I am in charge of is invaluable \nto the nation and our treaties with foreign nations which I take great pride \nin.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant frequently used marijuana from 2009 to 2012 while in high school. In \nNovember 2018, after being granted a security clearance in October 2018, Applicant \nknowingly purchased, possessed, and transported on a U.S. airline traveling cross \ncountry THC from one state to another and provided it as a gift for his friends. He stated \nhe was aware the transportation on a U.S. airline cross country likely violated state law. \nHis purchase, possession, and transportation of THC violated federal law. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder the drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to over this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . .. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThere is no evidence Applicant used marijuana since 2012. It has been more than \n11 years since his last use, and it is unlikely he will use it in the future. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) \nand 26(b) apply to his past marijuana use. \nApplicant made a conscious decision to purchase, possess, and transport THC on \na plane where he flew cross country and then distributed it as a gift to friends in violation \nof federal law. This occurred a little more than a month after being granted his first security \nclearance. He was on notice when he completed his May 2018 SCA that the possession, \npurchase, and transportation of marijuana violated the rules and regulations he was \nbound to follow while holding a security clearance. He clearly stated in his September \n2020 SCA that \u201c[t]his was trafficking THC from one legal state to another legal state but I \ntraveled on U.S. airlines across state lines which I believe makes this event illegal.\u201d (Item \n4) He also told the government investigator that he was aware his actions were against \nrules and regulations for those holding a security clearance. Applicant stated in his \nresponse to the FORM that he has actual access to classified information and the \nimportance of his work and securing material, which makes his conduct more egregious. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was infrequent and happened in 2018, but it did not happen under \nunique circumstances. To the contrary, he was well-aware of his choice and when asked \nby a government investigator why he did it, he said that he did not think he would have a \nreinvestigation for his security clearance for another ten years, which raises a concern \nabout his thought process in attempting to manipulate the security clearance adjudication \nprocess. His behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe above mitigating conditions do not apply.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress b a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nApplicant told the government investigator when he was interviewed in October \n2020 that he had never used THC and did not know how it would affect him. He did not \ndisclose his prior drug use. Applicant claimed because he previously disclosed his prior \ndrug use on his May 2018 SCA, he did not think it was relevant to the investigator, and \nhe did not believe he had to disclose it. I did not find his explanations credible. I have \nconsidered that he self-disclosed his purchase, possession, and transportation of THC in \nNovember 2018 in his September 2020 SCA. Applicant was aware he was violating rules, \nregulations, and procedures by purchasing THC while holding a security clearance. I find \nthe above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct his falsification. He \nwas first interviewed in October 2020. He was reinterviewed in November 2020. In June \n2022, he was provided a copy of a summary of his interviews. He did not make any \nrelevant corrections or attempts to clarify any misunderstanding. Applicant\u2019s conduct in \nknowingly purchasing, possessing, and transporting THC across the country in a plane \nshows a serious lapse in judgment. When questioned why he would do this, his response \nwas because he did not think he would be reinvestigated for ten years, which essentially \nis saying he did not think he would get caught. He did disclose the information in his \nSeptember 2020 SCA, but then later provided false information to the investigator. It is \nnot for Applicant to make a determination as to what information is relevant or not. His \nonly responsibility is to answer the questions honestly, which he did not. His actions were \nnot minor and did not happen under unique circumstances. Being truthful is at the heart \nof the security clearance adjudication process. The above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 5 at \npage 9.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant smoked marijuana over a period of seven years, ending in May of \n2021, after he began his current employment in March of 2021. He also used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms in April of 2021, and LSD as recently as February 2021. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these applies. His frequent use of marijuana continued after he began \nhis current employment. In his Answer he disavowals future usage, but it is too soon to \nsay his past substance misuse is not of current security clearance significance. \nHowever, in the future, after a period of time of continued abstinence, he may \nsuccessfully reapply for a security clearance. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nis found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~ 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

He was questioned about the incident in 2008, \nand was diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder and suicidal tendencies. (Tr. 25; GX 4) He \nwas prescribed medication for depression, but discontinued it because it caused lethargy, \nagitation, anxiety, and irritability, and made him difficult to focus on his tasks at work.

After Applicant\u2019s father passed away in 2013, he experienced increased \ndepression, and he started having auditory hallucinations of his father\u2019s voice, questioning \nhis worth and telling him to kill himself. His VA health providers diagnosed him with \nparanoid personality disorder and recommended inpatient admission, but he declined. \nEventually, His VA health providers prescribed a medication that reduced his depressive \nmood and auditory hallucinations. (GX 3 at 2; Tr. 29-30) When Applicant\u2019s assigned VA \nphysician was assigned to a different location, Applicant stopped taking his medication \nfor a while, hoping to see his assigned physician again or receive the same treatment \nfrom another VA physician. (Tr. 32) \nIn February 2014, Applicant was at a gas station when another driver accused him \nof cutting him off at the gas pump. Applicant, who was still in his vehicle, rolled up his \nwindow, trying to avoid conflict. The other driver was infuriated and began hitting the hood \nof Applicant\u2019s car. At this point, Applicant exited his car and had an altercation with the \nother driver, which was quickly broken up. \nAfter the altercation, Applicant was upset and heard voices telling him to look out \nfor himself. He went into a Navy Exchange store, attempted to shoplift some expensive \nheadphones and two candy bars, and was arrested. While awaiting trial, he self-admitted \nhimself into a VA mental health facility and was diagnosed with mood adjustment \ndisorder, moderate to severe depression, and borderline bipolar disorder. In June 2014, \nhe was convicted of stealing government property, a misdemeanor, fined $250, placed \non probation for six months, and required to continue mental health treatment as directed \nby his probation officer. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 7) The VA diagnosis is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe court-ordered mental-health treatment is alleged twice in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. \nIn March 2014, Applicant and his wife had an argument as he attempted to explain \nto her that his medications made him feel less social when he was in public. After his wife \ntold him to \u201cjust man up,\u201d he went for a drive in his truck and was beset with negative \nthoughts and hallucinations that told him to drive off the road. He drove into a ditch and \nsuffered minor injuries. Highway Patrol officers saw the vehicle in the ditch and issued \nhim a warning, but he was not charged. This incident is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant notified his VA providers of the March 2014 incident, and they prescribed \na medication that helped alleviate his auditory hallucinations. (GX 3 at 3) During an \nevaluation in June 2014, he told his providers that his angry outbursts began in his early \n20s and were occurring two or three times a week and that he had homicidal thoughts \nabout people who had wronged him. (Tr. 33-36) \nIn April 2016, Applicant stole baseball and football cards from a military exchange \nthat then took them to the customer service office for a refund.

(GX 6) This incident is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant stopped taking medications or receiving treatment for almost three years. \nHe went to a VA medical center in early 2019 and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder \nwith mixed features of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. He attended monthly therapy \nsessions for about nine months, when the funding for the program was cut. (Tr. 43) He \nbegan seeing a VA provider every three to six months until February 2021, when he was \nunable to obtain appointments for further face-to-face treatment. He was offered virtual \nappointments but declined them. (Tr. 44). He continued to have short telephonic sessions \nin which the VA provider confirmed that he had the correct prescription and renewed it. \nHis treatment in VA medical facilities from April 2011 to September 2019 is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. \nAt the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \npsychologist in February 2022. The psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s temperament \nis more stable when he takes his medications, which reduce his depressive mood \nsymptoms and tendency toward aggressive reactions. He noted that Applicant was mostly \ncompliant with his medications but that he occasionally forgot to take them or \nprocrastinated when a refill was needed. Applicant told the psychologist that he stopped \ntaking his medications for long periods of time during 2015 and 2016. The psychologist \nfound that Applicant has mild depressive episodes that may last for several hours up to \nthree or four days, but they are manageable and do not cause functional impairment. He \nalso found that Applicant\u2019s auditory hallucinations were remitted when he was placed on \nmedication. \nThe psychologist considered whether Applicant suffers from a bipolar disorder, and \nhe concluded that Applicant does not have the manic episodes that are an element of a \nbipolar disorder. He noted that Applicant shows insight and awareness of his \npsychological problems and has been able to clearly identify how they have caused \nimpairments in his personal and occupational environments. He diagnosed Applicant with \nintermittent explosive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, mild to moderate. \nAccording to DSM-5, aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have a rapid \nonset and typically last less than 30 minutes. The outbursts commonly occur in response \nto a minor provocation by a close intimate or associate. \nThe psychologist contacted two of Applicant\u2019s supervisors. One has known \nApplicant for 8-9 years and the other has known him for more than 10 years. Both \nsupervisors spoke highly of Applicant\u2019s competence and dependability. Neither was \naware of any interpersonal issues between Applicant and his coworkers. Both believed \nthat Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness were intact and recommended \nthat Applicant be allowed to retain his security clearance. (GX 3 at 6) \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness were currently intact, but that \u201chis emotional stability was highly \nvulnerable to external pressures or circumstances.\u201d He also concluded that Applicant\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nstability was \u201cnot likely to be highly resilient or capable of enduring through significant \nstressors and may result in him either experiencing deepening depression or aggressive \nbehaviors in the future.\u201d (GX 3 at 7) The evaluation by the psychologist is alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e. \nIn March 2023, Applicant visited a VA facility and announced that he wanted to \nrestore his self-confidence, decrease angry thoughts, and have better motivation to stop \nhis aggressive behavior that had been escalating over the past year. (GX 9 at 16) His \u201cVA \nProblem List\u201d reflected treatment for \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood.\u201d His \ntreatment notes for April 2023 stated, \u201cThe patient reported some symptoms of \ndepression; symptoms are not consistent with a major depressive episode.\u201d (GX 9 at 9) \nApplicant testified that the last time he thought about harming himself was in \nDecember 2018. He admitted that he had \u201cat least three\u201d angry episodes, over the past \nyear. He described these episodes as \u201cbeing angry for at least a minimum of 15 to 20 \nminutes.\u201d His angry periods sometimes last three or four days, but they cycle on and off \nrather than run continuously. Many of his angry episodes are prompted by his inability to \nperform to the standards he has set for himself. He testified that during his angry \nepisodes, he stops talking, becomes reclusive, and does not engage with others. He has \nlearned to channel his anger in a different direction by talking out loud, writing, walking, \nand focusing on positive events. (Tr. 48-52) \nApplicant testified that he has decided that \u201csitting and contemplating hurting \nyourself and hurting others is no way to live.\u201d He now focuses on a good marriage, a \n\u201cfairly decent\u201d job, and his \u201cbeautiful granddaughter.\u201d Regarding his granddaughter, he \ntestified, \nIt\u2019s pretty joyous to get to come home and see her. And you know, when I \nsee my granddaughter, no matter what I\u2019ve gone through today, [it] just \nmelts away all that anger and angst for me. She is pretty amazing.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d are supported by the medical records and \nApplicant\u2019s testimony. However, the SOR does not allege any of the underlying conduct \nthat raised questions about Applicant\u2019s mental health. As such, the SOR falls short of the \nspecificity required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3, and the unalleged conduct may not be the basis \nfor denying his application. Therefore, I have considered the unalleged conduct for the \nlimited purposes of determining which adjudicative guidelines are established and in my \nwhole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \nFurthermore, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege the same incident of court-ordered \nmedical treatment. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). For \nthese reasons, I have resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to \ntake prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions \nAG \u00b6 28(a) may not be a basis for revoking Applicant\u2019s clearance because no \nunderlying conduct was alleged. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s two assaults on coworkers, two \ninstances of shoplifting, and one incident of reckless driving are covered by Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established by the psychologist\u2019s report requested by DOD CAF, \nwhich is specifically alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is not established. No hospitalization was alleged and there is no \nevidence of hospitalization in the record. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established by the psychologist\u2019s report and Applicant\u2019s failures to \ncomply with his medication plan, which are specifically alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not fully established.

Applicant\u2019s condition is not temporary \nand he admitted at the hearing that he still experiences depression and angry episodes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service and the favorable testimonials from his current supervisors. He was \ncandid and sincere at the hearing. He demonstrated during his testimony that he is aware \nof his intermittent angry episodes and has devised methods of controlling them. His \ndevotion to his family, especially his granddaughter, have motivated him to adhere to his \ntreatment and medication regimen. However, not enough time has elapsed to determine \nif he will continue to adhere to his treatment plan and will be able to continue controlling \nhis angry episodes. \nThis is a close case, and close cases must be resolved in favor of national security. \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd.

After a careful review of \nthe pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since December \n2019, as an engineer. From February 2019 to July 2019, he was unemployed. From \n2016 to February 2019, he worked for a different federal contractor. He holds two \nbachelor\u2019s degrees in engineering. As of the hearing date, he was single, never married, \nwith no children. (Tr. 5, 23-24, 34; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2015 to 2021 federal and his \n2015-2016 and 2018-2021 state income tax returns, as required. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) \nApplicant\u2019s understanding of his federal and state income tax requirements were \nthat if he had a \u201ccredit\u201d (meaning he was due a refund from his previous year\u2019s tax \nwithholdings overpayment), he was not required to file a tax return. He also claimed he \nfiled extensions with the IRS to file his returns six months after the normal filing deadline \n(typically April 15, with the exception of the COVID years of 2020 and 2021). He also \nclaims he was unable to file his 2016 federal return because, \u201cmy 2016 federal taxes \nwere actually flagged for potential identity theft.\u201d He did not support this assertion with \ndocumentation. He also claimed that assistance from the IRS during 2020 was difficult \nbecause of the pandemic. He further stated that he always planned to file his tax \nreturns, but his life just got busy and he did not get around to doing it in a more timely \nfashion. He documented that he does not owe the IRS or his state for any tax debt. (Tr. \n35-39, 41-43, 49-50; SOR Answer; GE 2 (p. 6-bottom center pagination); AE B, E) \nApplicant was aware as early as 2019, when he completed his security clearance \napplication (SCA), that there was a problem with his 2016 taxes. During his background \ninterview in January 2020, he committed to filing his 2016 federal return \u201cwithin the next \nmonth.\u201d He did not file that return until December 2021. He attributed this delay to the \nIRS being unresponsive during the pandemic. He admitted that he has not sought \nprofessional tax assistance since approximately 2015. He did not consult with a tax \nattorney or CPA about his tax return filings. (Tr. 43, 57; GE 1 (p. 45); GE 2 (p. 10). \nApplicant\u2019s federal and state tax transcripts for tax years 2015-2021, show the \nfollowing: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTax Year \nDate Federal Return filed  \nDate State Return filed \n \n2015  \nApril 2018 (untimely) \n \nApril 2018 (untimely) \n \n2016  \nDecember 2021 (untimely)  \nApril 2018 (untimely) \n \n2017  \nApril 2018 (timely)  \n \nNot alleged in SOR \n \n2018  \nAugust 2022 (untimely) \n \n \n2019  \nAugust 2022 (untimely) \nAugust 2022 (untimely) \n \n2020  \nAugust 2022 (untimely)\nAugust 2022 (untimely) \n \n \n \nAugust 2022 (untimely \n \n2021  \nNot filed as of June 2023  \nJune 22, 2023 (untimely) \nApplicant also admitted that he had not filed his 2021 federal return in his June 20, 2023 \nemail to me (AE A). He filed his 2021 state return after his hearing. (AE 2 (pp. 15-35); \nAE A-B, D) \nApplicant produced two character letters from a former coworker and a friend of \n26 years. The coworker opined that Applicant is a professional and trustworthy person. \nHe believes Applicant is \u201crespectful of privacy, classified information, rules and \nrestrictions.\u201d His friend, who is an employee of defense contractor, also vouches for \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness. Neither indicated that they were aware of his tax return filing \nissues. (AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015-2016 and 2018-2021 federal and state \nincome tax returns. I find that he timely filed his 2017 federal tax return. I further find the \nabove disqualifying condition is raised with the remaining alleged years. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s misunderstanding of his income tax filing requirements is obvious \nfrom his testimony and documentary explanations. He has two bachelor\u2019s degree in \nengineering and is an intelligent person. Despite his knowledge that there were \nproblems with him not filing tax returns as early as 2019 and 2020. He failed to take \nresponsible action to address his tax-filing issues, or learn what his tax-filing \nresponsibilities were. He never consulted a tax attorney or CPA on the matter. He \nclaims he contacted the IRS during the pandemic, but received very little assistance \nfrom them. This is likely the case from early 2020 through mid-2021, but his tax-filing \nissues both precede and succeed that time frame. The evidence does not support that \nhe has taken responsible actions to timely file his federal tax and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. He receives some credit for finally filing his federal and state tax \nreturns, however, that credit is minimized by his extended delay in filing those returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) has some application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s character \nevidence, but I also considered his untimely filing of his 2015-2016 and 2018-2021 \nfederal and state income tax returns. Applicant has not established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility in dealing with his tax issues. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant  \n[Except for tax year 2017] \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

His testimony at the hearing regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 2.b indicated that he admitted that he was arrested but did not admit the conduct alleged. I have treated his answer to these allegations as denials. Applicant is a 38-year-old communications instructor employed by a defense contractor since April 2020. He graduated from a military academy in May 2007 and served on active duty until November 2012, when he received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while on active duty. He married in October 2009 and divorced in August 2013. He has a 13-year-old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife. In January 2003, while Applicant was attending the preparatory school for a military academy, he drank too much beer at an off-base location. He became ill and began to vomit as he and his friends were returning to the base. He and his friends were held by the gate guards until the command duty officer took custody of them and returned them to their quarters. Even though Applicant was underage, he was not cited by civilian authorities for underage drinking. His military superior restricted him to the base for 45 days for underage drinking. (GX 2 at 4; Tr. 18-19) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.

On \nAugust 3, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCAS CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G and J. The CAS acted under Executive Order \n(Exec.

On March 31, 2023, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for April 25, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were admitted in evidence without objection. Department \nCounsel requested that I take administrative notice of the guidance in the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual (5th  ed.) (DSM-5) pertaining to alcohol use disorder. I took \nadministrative notice as requested, without objection by Applicant. Applicant testified, \npresented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, \nwhich was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 15, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. His testimony at the hearing regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.f, and 2.b indicated that he admitted that he was arrested but did not admit the \nconduct alleged. I have treated his answer to these allegations as denials. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old communications instructor employed by a defense \ncontractor since April 2020. He graduated from a military academy in May 2007 and \nserved on active duty until November 2012, when he received an honorable discharge. \nHe held a security clearance while on active duty. He married in October 2009 and \ndivorced in August 2013. He has a 13-year-old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife. \nIn January 2003, while Applicant was attending the preparatory school for a \nmilitary academy, he drank too much beer at an off-base location. He became ill and \nbegan to vomit as he and his friends were returning to the base. He and his friends \nwere held by the gate guards until the command duty officer took custody of them and \nreturned them to their quarters. Even though Applicant was underage, he was not cited \nby civilian authorities for underage drinking. His military superior restricted him to the \nbase for 45 days for underage drinking. (GX 2 at 4; Tr. 18-19) This incident was alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nWhile Applicant was on active duty, he was deployed for about two years and \nbecame intoxicated between missions once or twice a month. He had no alcohol-related \ndisciplinary actions while on active duty. (Tr. 20) \nIn June 2012, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery on a family member \nand violating protective orders. The incident occurred when his wife began screaming at \nhim and trying to hit him, and he tried to fend her off. He believes that his wife\u2019s actions \nwere her reaction to his decision to file for divorce. (Tr. 21) She called the police, who \nrequired that one of them leave the house. Applicant volunteered to leave. His wife filed \ncharges of assault and battery and obtained a protective order to keep him away from \nthe family home where she was living. He violated the order when he went into the \ngarage at night to retrieve some of his possessions. His ex-wife called the police, who \narrested him.

(Tr. 33) These incidents were alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \nand 2.c. \nIn January 2013, Applicant was again charged with violating the protective order. \nHe asked a friend to go to the house and retrieve some of his belongings. His ex-wife \nnotified the police that Applicant had violated the protective order. When Applicant \nlearned that his ex-wife had contacted the police, he turned himself in. (GX 2 at 14, GX \n3 at 16-18) He was convicted and sentenced to 30 days in jail, with 28 days suspended. \n(GX 8 at 10). This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. \nIn March 2013, Applicant was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), first \noffense. He was drinking at a bar with several friends and had parked in an area that \nwas a tow-away zone after a certain time. Even though he realized he was drunk, he \ntried to drive to another parking area. He was arrested and registered a blood-alcohol \nlevel of .14 percent on a breathalyzer. (Tr. 28) He was sentenced to confinement for \none year (suspended) and unsupervised probation for 12 months. His driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for one year. He was required to install an ignition interlock on his \nvehicle and to attend alcohol safety action program (ASAP) classes. (GX 5; GX 6 at 1; \nTr. 27-29) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nIn March 2014, following a positive reading on Applicant\u2019s ignition interlock, he \nwas referred for substance abuse treatment and counseling, and the breathalyzer \nrequirement was extended for one or two months. He was required to attend weekly \ngroup therapy and attend two Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per month. He \ncompleted the program in June 2014. He attributed the positive interlock reading to \nusing mouthwash at work before driving home after work. (GX 7 at 3; Tr. 30) The \ninterlock violation was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nIn July 2015, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public. He was walking \nalone at night after spending the evening drinking with friends. Someone accused him \nof trying to break into cars. The police saw Applicant arguing with a group of people and \narrested him. (GX 2 at 10) At the hearing, he testified that he had consumed about four \ndrinks and was \u201cslightly buzzed\u201d at the time. (Tr. 33) He was found not guilty, but he \nwas ordered to seek counseling and treatment. (GX 6 at 3) He attended weekly \ncounseling from August 2015 to August 2016 and completed the treatment program. \n(GX 1 at 45-46; GX 2 at 15) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nIn March 2017, Applicant was riding his bicycle in a park with friends when he \nwas stopped by police because he and his friends were being loud. (GX 2 at 20) He \nwas charged with being drunk in public. He testified that he had consumed one or two \ndrinks. (Tr. 37) He was found guilty by the general district court. (GX 6 at 5). He \nappealed to the circuit court, pleaded not guilty, and the charge was dismissed. (GX 6 at \n7.)

He and a girlfriend spent an evening drinking wine at her apartment. He left her \napartment late in the evening, decided that he was too intoxicated to drive, and went to \nsleep in his car. A policeman found him sleeping in his car. (GX 2 at 10) He was found \nnot guilty. (GX 6 at 9) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nIn March 2019, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public and fleeing from \nlaw enforcement officers. He went to an after-hours bar with a group of friends who had \ngone to the bar on their bicycles. As the group walked toward their bicycles, policemen \nwho were in the parking lot approached them, and they ran in different directions. The \nrecord does not reflect why the police approached them or why they ran away. \nApplicant ran toward his bicycle but was tackled by a policeman. (GX 2 at 11) At the \nhearing, he testified that he had consumed about six beers but was not \u201coverly \nintoxicated.\u201d (Tr. 40) The drunk in public charge was dismissed, and he was found not \nguilty of fleeing from law enforcement officials. (GX 6 at 11-15) This incident was \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nIn December 2019, Applicant was charged with DWI, 2nd  offense within 5-10 \nyears, and refusing a breathalyzer. He was stopped by police because a taillight on his \ncar was out. The police conducted a field sobriety test, but Applicant declined to take a \nbreathalyzer test. (GX 2 at 11) The results of the field sobriety test are not reflected in \nthe record. He testified that he had consumed three drinks. He was held in jail for a \nweek and then released on bail. While he was awaiting trial, he was required by the \ncourt to abstain from alcohol and seek counseling. (Tr. 49) Both charges were disposed \nof by nolle prosequi. (GX 4; GX 6 at 17-20) This incident was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nIn March 2020, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on a family \nmember. He was sitting in his car with his girlfriend, now his fianc\u00e9e, who had found a \ncondom in his car and suspected him of cheating. She started screaming and hitting \nherself in the face. At the hearing, his fianc\u00e9e testified that she suffers from anxiety and \ndepression, and when she becomes upset, she tends to hurt herself by hitting herself in \nthe face, scratching her face and pulling out her hair. She testified that Applicant was \nshouting at her and trying to stop her from hurting herself. Witnesses to the incident \nheard the shouting, saw her bleeding, and concluded that Applicant had injured her. (Tr. \n60-61) The charge was nolle prosequi in January 2021. (GX 3; GX 8 at 13) This incident \nwas alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nWhile Applicant was awaiting trial for the incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e, he \nattended AA meetings in 2020 and had a sponsor. He is not currently receiving any \ncounseling or treatment. (Tr. 52) \nApplicant testified that he now works in the sensitive area of cybersecurity and no \nlonger associates with his bar-hopping former associates. He now focuses on studying, \ncybersecurity, working out, staying in shape, and adopting healthier habits. (Tr. 54.)

She has known Applicant for \nsix years and they have become close during the last five years. He stays with them for \nabout one week a month because they live close to his work site. He joins them for \nmeals and recreation time, works from their home, and goes on trips with them. Even \nwhen they go to restaurants, Applicant does not drink. She regards Applicant as a \ntalented and dedicated person who has turned his life around. (Tr. 64-65) \nIn February 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist in \naccordance with a CAS request for a psychological evaluation. The DWI and \nbreathalyzer-refusal charges were pending when Applicant was interviewed by the \npsychologist. (Tr. 42-43) The psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder, \nmoderate. The psychologist\u2019s report recites the numerous specific incidents that had \noccurred after Applicant had been drinking. Applicant admitted during the evaluation \nthat while on active duty he would consume 6-10 drinks per incident. He told the \npsychologist, \u201cWhen I drink, I may drink a lot.\u201d He also told the psychologist that he had \nreduced his consumption due to his \u201clegal issues.\u201d The psychologist concluded that \nApplicant had not been able to abstain from alcohol for more than six months at any \ntime in his adult life despite DWI charges, alcohol education courses, treatment \nprograms, a requirement for monthly urinalysis tests, and a court order requiring him to \nabstain from alcohol until his court date for the charges of assaulting his girlfriend. (GX \n7) \nAt the hearing, Applicant disagreed with the psychologist\u2019s statement about his \ncontinued drinking. He testified that he stopped drinking in early 2020, but he admitted \ndrinking a champagne toast at a New Year\u2019s Day celebration, but he did not specify \nwhich year or years that he did so. He believes that the psychologist interpreted his \ncomment about drinking a toast on New Year\u2019s Day to mean that he continues to drink \nregularly. (Tr. 50) The psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol use disorder is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. \nI have taken administrative notice that DSM 5 describes 11 diagnostic criteria for \nalcohol use disorder. At least two of the diagnostic criteria must have occurred within a \n12-month period to warrant a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. The DSM also provides \nthat an alcohol use disorder is considered to be in sustained remission if none of the \ncriteria have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer, except for the \ncriterion of a \u201ccraving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.\u201d The psychologist did \nnot specifically identify which diagnostic criteria he relied on to make his diagnosis. \nIn March 2023, Applicant was offered employment by a defense contractor, \ncontingent on verification of a security clearance. (AX A) The employment offer was still \nopen at the time of the hearing.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden\nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nWashington Metro.

Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive alcohol \nuse. He completed a treatment program in August 2016, attended AA meetings in 2020, \nand has not consumed alcohol since his arrest for DWI in December 2019, more than \nthree years ago, except for a one or more isolated incidents involving a New Year\u2019s \nchampagne toast. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d-\n1.h. It also alleges the assault and battery in June 2012 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), the violations of \nprotective orders (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, and 2.d), and the assault in March 2020. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s multiple arrests and his violation of the interlock program in 2014 are \nsufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to \ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established for the domestic incident in 2012 and the \nrelated violations of a protective order. Applicant has been divorced since 2013 and has \nminimal contact with his ex-wife. He has not been involved in any other incidents of \ndomestic assault. These two mitigating conditions also are established for the alcohol-\nrelated incidents. Applicant has significantly curtailed his use of alcohol, and there have \nbeen no alcohol-related incidents since December 2019. A former supervisor and his \nfuture mother-in-law have known him for many years and hold him in high regard. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the charge of DWI alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and the \ncharge of domestic assault alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e, which were not supported by reliable \nevidence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was sincere, remorseful, candid, and \ncredible. When he was on active duty, he engaged in heavy drinking while off duty. After \nhe left active duty, he associated with a group of men whose social life revolved around \nfrequent bar hopping and heavy drinking. His social life changed after his arrest in \nDecember 2019. Five days in jail apparently gained his attention. He is now involved in \na serious relationship. He has earned the respect of a former supervisor and has been \noffered a demanding and responsible job. He is focused on his work and a healthy \nlifestyle. The strong and favorable testimony of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother, an experienced \nmedical professional who has known him for six years, was compelling evidence of \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines G and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant initially denied, \u201cdue to mitigating circumstances,\u201d that he owed \nback-taxes totaling about $16,875 (GX 3), but now admits the allegation. In the past, he \nfailed to pay sufficient Federal income taxes; that were due after filing his tax returns, \nputting them last on his priorities of debts to pay. He was satisfied with letting his state \ntax refunds go towards his Federal tax debt. Now realizing the gravity of his \ncircumstances, Applicant has initiated a payment plan by which he is making monthly \npayments of $500 towards his back-taxes, as evidenced by documentation from the \nFederal taxing authority. (TR at pages 22 lines 15~20, page 27 line 15 to page 28 line, \nat page 42 line 22 to page 44 line 17, and AppXs B, C and I.) \n1.b. Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March of \n2011; and as a result, his debts were discharged in June of 2011. (GX 4.) As noted \nabove, Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to periods of unemployment, a failed \nbusiness, and to health issues. (TR at page 31 line 10 to page 39 line 4, at page 40 line \n11 to page 41 line 6, and at page 42 lines 15~19.) Having occurred more than a decade \nago, I find that it has no current security significance. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011, and had significant tax \ndelinquencies The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past, financial problems have been rectified. He has initiated a \npayment plan by which his past-due Federal taxes are being addressed, to the \nsatisfaction of the Federal taxing authority. He has demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nrespected in the workplace. He performs well at his job. (AppXs J and K.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until July 6, 2023, to enable \nhim to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough G, which were admitted without objection.

Applicant indicated on the record that he understood \nthe amendments and corrections of the SOR. (Tr. 8) His admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He has been offered a position with a defense contractor, \ncontingent on obtaining a security clearance. He married in December 2014, and they \nhad two children, now ages 6 and 7. He divorced his first wife on a date not reflected in \nthe record. He married his current wife in November 2020, with whom he has a 10-month-\nold daughter.  \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2014 to November \n2016 and received an other than honorable discharge. He received a security clearance \nwhile on active duty. \nIn April 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for assaulting another sailor. The incident \ninvolved a fist fight that occurred when Applicant asked a fellow sailor to help out on a \nproject and the fellow sailor did not respond. (GX 6 at 12) His punishment was restriction \nfor 30 days, extra duties for 30 days, reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his \nbasic pay per month for two months. (GX 8 at 8) \nIn August 2016, Applicant and his wife had an altercation over his text messages \nwith another woman. At the hearing, he testified that his wife choked him, and he slapped \nher to stop her from choking him. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant received nonjudicial punishment \nfor this incident, which consisted of reduction in rate, and forfeiture of one half of his pay \nper month for two months, suspended for six months.

This incident occurred when Applicant was playing a video game \nwhen his wife was talking to him. When he ignored her, she broke the game controller, \nand he responded by smashing the television screen. (GX 6 at 9) His wife claimed that \nhe struck her in the face and head, knocking her to the floor. At the hearing, he denied \nhitting her, but admitted that he pushed her. He was charged by civilian authorities with \nmisdemeanor assault and battery on a family member. The civilian prosecution was \ndeferred in February 2019 to enable Applicant to complete court-ordered counseling. (GX \n7 at 6; Tr. 40-41) \nDuring the November 2016 altercation, Applicant\u2019s wife was holding their baby \ndaughter. A protective order was issued against Applicant, and in January 2017, he was \nlisted as a child abuser in the state child abuse and neglect registry. (GX 11; GX 12) He \nwill remain on the registry until November 2023. (Tr. 41) \nApplicant testified that he did not tell his commanding officer or the police that his \nwife was the aggressor in the domestic incidents. His wife was on active duty in the Navy \nand he kept silent in an effort to enable her to retain her military benefits. (Tr. 43) \nOn the day after the November 2016 altercation, Applicant attempted to commit \nsuicide by overdosing a prescribed muscle relaxant. He called his wife and told her that \nhe had ingested the drugs. His wife called an ambulance, and he was taken to an \nemergency room and then admitted to a military hospital. He received medical treatment \nand was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood. He was \nhospitalized for two or three days and discharged. The medical authorities recommended \nthat he attend outpatient psychotherapy. He testified that he did not obtain psychotherapy \nas recommended, but he began obtaining therapy about six months later and was \ndiagnosed with anxiety. He stopped the therapy when his therapist retired around 2019. \nHe resumed therapy for about six months in 2020 but stopped when his insurance would \nno longer cover it. (Tr. 43-47; GX 5; GX 6 at 9) \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2012 to 2013. He resumed \nhis marijuana use in 2017, after he was discharged from the Navy, using it once or twice \na month. (GX 6 at 20). He testified that he has not smoked marijuana since 2020, because \nmost of his friends with whom he smoked marijuana are married and have children, and \nseveral are DOD employees. (Tr. 66) \nIn April 2017, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of drugs, \npossession of marijuana, tampering with evidence, driving with defective equipment, and \noperation of a vehicle with an expired license tag. The evidence tampering charge was \nbased on a police officer accusing him of attempting to eat marijuana that was in the \nvehicle when he and an acquaintance were stopped by police. (GX 6 at 14) \nThe police report for the April 2017 incident recites that the police were operating \na driver\u2019s license checkpoint, and they observed Applicant\u2019s vehicle turn around in a \nparking lot in an apparent attempt to avoid the checkpoint.

When Applicant exited the car, the piece of marijuana that was on his lap fell onto \nthe ground. The police officer asked Applicant to open his mouth and he saw small pieces \nof marijuana on his tongue, and his tongue was covered with a green film. Applicant \ndeclined to be tested for drugs. (GX 13) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he believed he was innocent of the drug \ncharges, but he was told that his trial would not be until eight months later unless he \npleaded guilty. (Tr. 57-58) In June 2017, he pleaded guilty, was convicted of driving under \nthe influence of drugs, and was sentenced to eight days in jail and community service. \nHe was placed on probation for 60 months. For the marijuana possession, he was fined \n$1,200 and placed on probation for 12 months. For tampering with evidence, he was fined \n$750 and placed on probation for 12 months. (GX 7 at 9; GX 9) \nIn January 2019, Applicant failed to report to his probation officer as required. (GX \n10) At the hearing, he testified that he failed to report because he was unsuccessful in \ntrying to contact the new probation officer who was assigned to his case. (Tr. 60-61) The \nprobation officer\u2019s affidavit, dated January 24, 2019, recited that the probation officer had \ncalled Applicant at least twice at a telephone number that is the same telephone number \nas Applicant provided in his answer to the SOR. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant \nhad not contacted his probation officer. As a result, the running of his time on probation \nhas been tolled since January 24, 2019, and he is still on probation. (Tr. 63) \nAt the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist in \nOctober 2021. The psychologist concluded that Applicant \u201cdoes not appear to have any \nmental health conditions that would negatively impact his ability or willingness to \nsafeguard classified information.\u201d However, the psychologist also noted that Applicant \n\u201chas personality characteristics and behavioral tendencies that could negatively impact \nhis judgment and trustworthiness.\u201d (GX 3 at 8) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCAs in December 2013 and September 2018, he \ndid not disclose that he used marijuana with varying frequency between 2012 and 2013. \n(GX 1 at 30-31; GX 2 at 19) In his answer to the SOR amendment and at the hearing, \nHe admitted intentionally not disclosing it in both SCAs. He testified that a military recruiter \nadvised him not to disclose it. (Tr. 14, 67) \nApplicant admitted that he did not disclose his arrest for assault and battery in his \nSeptember 2018 SCA, because he believed it was not reflected in his record.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

(SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness.

A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; and \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not fully established. After Applicant\u2019s suicide attempt and \nhospitalization for three days, he did not follow the recommendation of medical authorities \nthat he attend outpatient therapy. After about six months, he began some kind of therapy \nnot reflected in the record, but he stopped it when his therapist retired in 2019, resumed \ntherapy for about six months, and then stopped it because his insurance would not cover \nit. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(c) and 29(d) are not fully established.

However, he expressed concern that Applicant\u2019s \npersonality and behavioral tendencies could have a negative effect on his judgment and \ntrustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 29(e) is not established. The psychologist found no mental health conditions, \nbut he expressed concern that Applicant\u2019s personality characteristics could have a \nnegative effect on his judgment and trustworthiness. The behavior alleged under \nGuidelines J, H, and E validates the psychologist\u2019s concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for an assault on \na fellow sailor (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he was charged with assault and battery a family member \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b); that he received nonjudicial punishment for the same assault on a family \nmember (SOR \u00b6 2.c); that he was listed in the state child abuse and neglect registry as a \nchild abuser because his infant daughter was present during the assault and battery on \na family member (SOR \u00b6 2.d); that he was charged and convicted of DUI, possession of \nmarijuana, tampering with evidence, defective equipment, and an expired license tag \n(SOR \u00b6 2.e); and that he violated the terms of probation imposed for the criminal conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e (SOR \u00b6 2.f). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege the same conduct but different consequences. As such, \nthey are duplicative. When the same conduct is alleged more than once in the SOR under \nthe same guideline, the duplicative allegation should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Accordingly, I have resolved \nSOR \u00b6 2.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe registration of Applicant in the child abuse and neglect registry was a \nconsequence of the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, but it was not a separate act of \nmisconduct. Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 2.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.e, and 2.f and are sufficient to establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation; and \nAG \u00b6 31(d): violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to \ncomplete a court-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant used marijuana as recently \nas 2020. He is still on probation and has not complied with the terms of his probation. \nGuideline H, Drug Use and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \napproximately 2012 through 2013 and again in 2017. SOR \u00b6 3.b cross-alleges that he \npossessed marijuana as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. SOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency in 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b mistakenly cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 2.c, which alleges an assault. It \napparently was intended to cross-allege SOR \u00b6 2.e, which alleges Applicant\u2019s arrest for \nmultiple offenses, including possession of marijuana. I have resolved SOR \u00b6 3.b for \nApplicant. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of\nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances\nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner\ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may\nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises\nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established.

Applicant has received counseling and treatment, \nbut none of it was specifically for drug use. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nand \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

Aug. 8, 2011.) \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications were numerous and recent. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I, J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

He has held a security clearance since 2009. (GE 1; Tr. \n31-35, 57-62) \nApplicant attended some college and has earned numerous IT certifications. He \nmarried in February 2022.

(GE 1 at 35-39) In \nApril 2021, an intelligence agency warned Applicant about security concerns raised by \nhis financial problems and granted him a \u201cconditional clearance\u201d for access to certain \nintelligence information. (AE C) The agency concluded he provided evidence of good-\nfaith efforts to resolve delinquent accounts that were later alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c \nthrough 1.h, and that his financial issues were caused by circumstances beyond his \ncontrol.

He said he attempted to file for bankruptcy, but his attorney never \ncompleted the process. After discussing his credit problems with a government \ninvestigator, Applicant started resolving some delinquent debts in 2020 with funds from \nan income tax refund. He said he was paying off his delinquent debts and stated his \nintention to restore his good credit. (GE 1 at 35-39, 41, GE 2 at 8; Tr. 24, 35-40, 49-52, \n59-60) \nThe evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: mortgage account placed for collection for $124,265. Applicant \ndenied the allegation, stated the mortgage account was closed in about February 2016 \nand removed from his credit report in 2022. (Answer) He testified that he accepted a \npayout from the creditor and moved out of the marital home after his 2015 divorce to \nresolve the delinquency. A March 2020 credit report shows the account was closed in \nDecember 2015 with no balance due, but credit reports from September 2021 and March \n2022 erroneously show the account as in collection. He provided documentary evidence \nthe mortgage account was closed in December 2015 with no balance due, \ncorrespondence from April 2022 confirming credit bureaus were provided corrected \ninformation, and credit reports from May 2023. (AE A-C, F; GE 1 at 36-37, GE 1-5; Tr. \n24-28, 38-39, 44) This debt was resolved in December 2015. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit account charged off for $17,544. Applicant denied the \nallegation, said the account was no longer delinquent and that payment arrangements \nwere made on January 8, 2022. (Answer) Credit reports from March 2020 and September \n2021 show a July 2015 balance date and balance of $17,544, and that the account was \ncharged off for $17,544. (GE 4 at 2, GE 5 at 5) In December 2021, Applicant \nacknowledged the debt was unpaid, reported entering a payment agreement and making \nmonthly payments of $100, and acknowledged he had not submitted documentary \nevidence of payment status or proof of payments. (GE 2 at 3-4, 9) \nHe testified this debt was for a line of credit or loan he obtained to start a small \nbusiness in about 2014, that he probably stopped making payments at about the time of \nhis divorce, and that the account had been charged-off. He said after this debt came up \nduring an interview with a government investigator he decided \u201cI need to address this. So \nI did work out at the time with them a payment, an auto-deduction from my account \nmonthly of [$100] . . . . They continue to make deductions from my bank account[.]\u201d (Tr. \n40-41) During the hearing, he acknowledged he had not provided evidence of payments, \nstated his understanding that bank statements showing payments to the creditor could \nprovide such evidence, and stated his intent to keep making payments until the debt was \npaid. (Tr. 39-49, 51-53) \nAfter the hearing, he submitted a letter dated February 26, 2022, showing an \naccount balance of $23,662, and that he authorized the creditor to debit his bank account \nfor $100 monthly from March to December 2022 to apply towards the debt.

He did not submit bank account records or other documentary \nevidence of payments made on this debt. (GE 2-5; AE A, E, G; Tr. 39-49, 51-53) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit account charged off for $7,999. Applicant denied the \nallegation and said he paid the account on February 24, 2021. (Answer) He \nacknowledged he had given his ex-spouse access to this credit-card account and said he \nsettled the account. He said he had correspondence showing the creditor\u2019s willingness to \nsettle the account for about $6,000 and bank records showing he had paid that amount \nin February 2021, but he did not submit that documentary evidence. (Tr. 36, 48-51) A \nMarch 2020 credit report shows the account was charged off for $7,999 in June 2015, \nand in collection for $7,999. (GE 5 at 6) A September 2021 credit report shows a balance \nof $7,999 but indicates the account was \u201csettled for less than full balance\u201d and \u201cpaid \ncharge off.\u201d (GE 4 at 2-3) I resolve this allegation for Applicant because his September \n2021 credit report and AE C corroborate his claim that he settled this debt in 2021. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit collection account for $1,430. Applicant denied the allegation \nand said he paid the account on March 22, 2021. (Answer) A March 2020 credit report \nshows the account with activity in August 2014 and in collection for $1,430. (GE 5 at 6) \nCredit reports from September 2021, March 2022, and May 2023 do not reflect this \naccount. He testified he paid the debt in full in March 2021 and said he had proof of \npayment. After the hearing, he submitted evidence including bank records that he paid \nthe debt in full on July 11, 2023. (Tr. 54-55; AE H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit account charged off for $1,082. Applicant denied the \nallegation and said he paid the account on March 17, 2021. (Answer) A March 2020 credit \nreport showed the account as charged off for $1,082 in February 2015, and as in \ncollection for $931. (GE 5 at 6) In December 2021 and at the hearing, Applicant said he \nhad paid the debt. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 28, 55) After the hearing, he submitted bank records \nshowing he paid the creditor $931 on March 17, 2021. (AE I) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: credit account charged off for $911. Applicant denied the allegation \nand said he paid a collection agency on March 17, 2021. (Answer) A March 2020 credit \nreport shows the account as assigned in April 2010, charged off for $911 in February \n2015, and in collection for $911. (GE 5 at 7) In December 2021 and at the hearing, he \nsaid he had paid the debt but did not provide evidence of payment. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 55-56) \nAfter the hearing, he asserted this debt was transferred to another creditor, that the \ncreditor acknowledged the account was resolved, but that he had not yet received \npromised proof of payment from the creditor, and that his online account was no longer \naccessible. (AE E) He submitted a bank record showing payment of $501 to that creditor \non March 17, 2021, which referenced the original creditor.

(GE 5 at \n7) In December 2021 and at the hearing, he said he had paid the debt but did not provide \nevidence of payment. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 55-56) After the hearing, he submitted documentary \nevidence including a bank statement showing that he paid the debt in June 2023. (AE K) \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation has improved. His gross annual income increased \nfrom about $99,000 in 2018 to about $110,000. In April 2022, he obtained a $373,000 \nmortgage loan and has made timely payments since. In January 2023, he purchased a \n2021 model-year vehicle and has made regular payments since. He said he has about \n$1,500 in the bank, and $26,000 in a retirement account. (AE A, Tr. 23-28, 66, 72-76) \nApplicant has not received formal financial counseling. He provided a written \nbudget in December 2021 and reported a remainder of about $1,900 a month after \nexpenses. He said he had a more comprehensive financial statement and acknowledged \nhis understanding that submission of that document could be helpful but did not do so. \n(GE 2 at 9; Tr. 56-57, 76-77) \nDuring the hearing Applicant was informed of the importance of providing \ndocumentary evidence of debt payments, contact with creditors, and efforts to address or \nresolve his delinquent debts. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 42-46, 55-57, 62-66, 70-72, 76-78, 84) \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from his current supervisor, a \nformer co-worker and friend, and his former spouse that comment favorably on his \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, performance, expertise, security awareness, and \nloyalty. (AE D) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information.

The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to at least 2014. The SOR \nalleges seven delinquent accounts totaling $153,540. In December 2015, he resolved the \nlargest SOR debt, a delinquent mortgage totaling about $124,265. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In \nFebruary and March 2021, he resolved three debts totaling $9,992, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f). \nIn June and July 2023, he resolved two debts totaling $1,739 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g). Applicant \nhas not resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, charged-off for $17,544 and with a \nbalance of $23,662 as of February 26, 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances have \nsignificantly improved. However, his financial problems are longstanding, and he took no \naction to resolve six of seven debts alleged in the SOR until after submitting an SCA in \nJanuary 2020 and discussing his financial problems with a government investigator. Most \nsignificantly, his failure to address a $17,544 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) from at least July 2015 \nuntil February 2022, and his varying and uncorroborated claims of payments on that debt \nsince December 2021 cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s divorce and associated marital debt, \nfailed business venture, underemployment, and unemployment were largely beyond his \ncontrol. However, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) is not established because he has not received financial counseling. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant engaged in a good-faith effort to \nresolve his delinquent mortgage in December 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Although he \nsubsequently resolved five of the six remaining SOR debts, he did so only after submitting \na SCA in January 2020 and after discussing his financial issues with a government \ninvestigator. The timing of an Applicant\u2019s actions, including repayment of delinquent \ndebts, impacts upon the degree to which the mitigating factors apply. ISCR Case No. 08-\n06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Waiting to pay legitimate debts until forced to do so \nby the security clearance process does not constitute good-faith debt resolution. See \nISCR Case No. 10-05909 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). \nAdditionally, he provided insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that he has \ninitiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He \nfailed to address this $17,544 delinquent debt from at least July 2015 until February 2022. \nAfter responding to questions from the DOD CAF about this debt in December 2021, he \nentered an agreement with the creditor to make monthly payments of $100 from March \nto December 2022 on the debt then totaling $23,662. In December 2021 and during his \nhearing he said he had made and would continue to make required monthly payments \nbut provided no documentary evidence of a single payment. That this debt has dropped \noff recent credit reports is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 25, 2015)). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s work history, security clearance history, and that his financial problems were \ncaused, in part, by circumstances beyond his control. I also considered his favorable \ncharacter evidence, improved financial circumstances, and that he has paid most of his \ndelinquent debts. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nHowever, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith a longer track record of financial responsibility, he may be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
