Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 8 July 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nH.  Applicant answered the SOR on 28 July 2008, and requested a decision without\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 19 November 2008. The record in this case\nclosed 19 October 2008, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) was due. Applicant did not respond to the FORM.\nNovember 28, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 24-year-old electrical engineer\nemployed by a defense contractor since May 2007. He has not previously held a\nclearance.\nApplicant began using marijuana in late 2002, during his senior year in high\nschool, in social settings. He estimates he used marijuana monthly from then until his\nMay 2007 graduation from high school. He also estimates buying a $20 bag of\nmarijuana fewer than 10 times. Otherwise, he used marijuana provided by his friends.\nWhile he was in college from August 2003 to February 2007, he estimates using\nmarijuana two or three times per year. He last used marijuana in July 2007, just before\napplying for his security clearance (Item 4). He stopped because was preparing to\ngraduate from college and he knew marijuana use would not be acceptable in the\nworkplace. He disclosed his marijuana use on his clearance application, estimating that\nhe used marijuana 30 times between September 2002 and July 2007.\nDuring a subject interview in October 2007, he described his marijuana use as\nabove, and opined that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, especially while\nemployed by a government contractor, but could not rule out using it again after he\nretired. In March 2008, he confirmed the contents of his subject interview (Item 5). In his\nanswer, he categorically states an intent to not use marijuana in the future.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b625.(a) any drug abuse. . .; (c) illegal drug possession, including. . . purchase. . . ; (h) expressed intent to\n3\ncontinue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinued drug use.\n\u00b626.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b626.(b). a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as; . . . (3) an appropriate period\n5\nof abstinence; . . . (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation;\n3\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H,  and\n3\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant used marijuana casually for\nfive years beginning in 2002, stopping in anticipation of his employment by a\ngovernment contractor. This use was neither distant in time, infrequent, nor under\nunusual circumstances unlikely to recur.  His abstinence from drug use\u2014approximately\n4\none year\u2014is inadequate to demonstrate an intent to refrain from drug use in the future\nparticularly where he equivocated on future use. I cannot conclude Applicant is unlikely\nto use illegal drugs in the future.  Further, a whole-person analysis cannot help\n5\nApplicant in this case because the record contains no favorable evidence about him that\nmight support such an analysis. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n4\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 52 years of age and married. He is employed as an Aircraft Electronic Technician for a defense contractor. He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Kuwait City, Kuwait in 1956, and speaks English and Arabic. In 1974, after graduating from high school, at the age of eighteen, he needed a job and voluntarily joined the Kuwaiti Air Force. A year later, in 1975, during an international assignment, he came to the United States on a student visa while serving in the Kuwaiti Air Force. (Tr. p. 42). He finished the assignment in 1978, and returned to Kuwait. That next year, he was released from his military obligations and decided to return to the United States on a visitor\u2019s visa. In December 1978, while visiting the United States, he met his wife, a native born American citizen. They got married in January 1979, and eventually had two native born American children.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Attorney At Law\nFebruary 4, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire For National Security Positions on August\n22, 2004.  On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nB for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on October 2, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on October 22, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 30, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for December 11, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented four exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 4.  The Applicant called\none witness, presented two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, and\ntestified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on\nDecember 22, 2008, to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.\nApplicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit consisting of seven pages, referred to as\nPost-Hearing Exhibit A.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on January 5, 2009.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Kuwait.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 23).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 52 years of age and married.  He is\nemployed as an Aircraft Electronic Technician for a defense contractor.  He seeks a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Kuwait City, Kuwait in 1956, and speaks English and\nArabic.  In 1974, after graduating from high school, at the age of eighteen, he needed a\njob and voluntarily joined the Kuwaiti Air Force.  A year later, in 1975, during an\ninternational assignment, he came to the United States on a student visa while serving\nin the Kuwaiti Air Force.  (Tr. p. 42).  He finished the assignment in 1978, and returned\nto Kuwait.  That next year, he was released from his military obligations and decided to\nreturn to the United States on a visitor\u2019s visa.  In December 1978, while visiting the\nUnited States, he met his wife, a native born American citizen.  They got married in\nJanuary 1979, and eventually had two native born American children.  At that point, the\nApplicant decided to make the United States his permanent home.      \nSince 1982, but for a short break in service, the Applicant has worked for his\ncurrent employer in the defense industry.  In 1984, he became a United States citizen.\nBeginning in 1988, he has held Secret and Top Secret security clearances for many\nyears.  He has never violated any security policies or procedures in protecting classified\ninformation.  He has never received any violations or infractions of any sort.  Since\n1978, he has never returned to Kuwait for any reason. \nThe Applicant has a number of family members who reside in Kuwait.  His only\nregular contact is with his seventy-two year mother in Kuwait.  When they talk, they talk\nabout family.  His other relatives he knew very little about and is not close to.  As a\nresult of this security clearance investigation, the Applicant contacted his mother to get\nmore information about his relatives in Kuwait to report to the DoD investigators.  The\nApplicant has seven sisters, a brother, and two brother-in-laws who are also citizens\n\n3\nand residents of Kuwait.  His father, before he passed away in 2004, retired years ago\nas a driver for a government ministry.  Applicant believes that his mother receives a\ngovernment pension for her husband\u2019s service.  Other than his sister who came to visit\nin 1982, he has not seen any of his relatives in Kuwait since he left in 1978.  The only\ncontact he has with any of his relatives on any regular basis is his mother.  He contacts\nher once a month or once every two to three months.  Sometimes it goes six months\nbefore he calls her.  (Tr. p 54).  He has refrained from talking with her because he does\nnot want it to jeopardize his security clearance.  At times when he contacts his mother, if\none of his sisters is there, he speaks to them briefly about family matters.  \nHis eldest sister is a retired school teacher.  Her husband, before he retired,\nworked for a government ministry.  Another sister is married to a senior officer in the\nKuwaiti Army.  The Applicant has never met him and has absolutely no contact with\nhim.  (Tr. p. 57).  Applicant\u2019s youngest sister, whom he also has never met, lives with\ntheir mother and works for an automobile insurance company.  (Tr. pp. 55 and 108).\nAnother sister is a kindergarten principal and she is married to man who works for the\nKuwait Oil Company.  The other sisters are either middle school, high school, or college\nteachers.  One of the Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s works for a government ministry.  The\nApplicant has never met or spoken to him.  Another sister is married to a retired police\nofficer.  Another sister is a homemaker and she is married to an Engineer who works for\na government ministry.  Applicant\u2019s only brother works for a government ministry where\nhe is a supervisor.  The Applicant speaks to him about once a year.  (Tr. p. 98).  The\nApplicant has never told any of his relatives including his mother, with whom he is the\nclosest, that he works for the defense industry.  (Tr. p. 58).  None of his family have any\nknowledge as to what the Applicant does for a living or with whom he works.  None of\nhis family in Kuwait is affiliated with any terrorists organization.  (Tr. p. 119).\n           \nAt one time in 2007, the Applicant was planning to visit his mother because he\nlearned that she was very ill.  Her health improved and he did not pursue the issue.\nWhen asked whether he would like to travel to Kuwait in the future, the Applicant\nresponded, \u2018NO\u201d.  \u201cIf there is a security concern.  I had it in my mind I am going to go\nsee my mother.  That was the only thing, but I don\u2019t have no plans to go.\u201d  (Tr. p. 110).\nThe Applicant testified that he contacted his security officer and was told that he could\nperiodically contact his mother by telephone without it presenting a security issue.  (Tr.\npp. 121-122).\nThe Applicant considers himself to be an American, and with honor, dignity and\nloyalty he states that he will protect the interests of the United States.  He states that he\nwould never under any circumstances divulge unauthorized classified information to\nanyone.  If he is ever confronted to do so, he would contact his security department and\npossibly the FBI and DSS.  (Tr. p. 125).  He does not participate in any cultural events\nor activities of middle eastern affairs.  He has no financial assets in Kuwait and has\nnever received any money from anyone in Kuwait.  He does not stand to inherit\nanything from anyone in Kuwait.       \nTwenty-five letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from\nprofessional associates, coworkers, managers, neighbors and friends, attest to his\noverall stature of excellence.  On the job, he is said to be excellent at troubleshooting,\nelectrical modification abilities and at other job requirements in his expertise.  He works\n\n4\nas many hours as necessary in order to get the job done.  Some jobs require that he\ntravel to different locations to complete, and he never complains.  The Applicant is\nknown as a hardworking, responsible, reliable, trustworthy, loyal, dedicated citizen of\nthe United States.  His integrity has never been questioned by the company.  He is\nhighly respected by his management and peers and is considered to be a great asset to\nthe company.  To many, he is a close friend, known as a loyal father and husband, who\nhas been a good provider to his family.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B and Post-Hearing Exhibit\nA). \nApplicant has received numerous awards and certificates of appreciation for his\nexceptional and outstanding performance and contributions on the job.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A).   \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the country of Kuwait.\nKuwait is a small oil-rich constitutional monarchy, ruled by the Al-Sabah family.  The\ndispute between Iraq and Kuwait\u2019s borders and the subsequent invasion of Kuwait by\nIraq, led to the first Persian gulf war between Iraq and a UN mandated coalition of\ncountries led by the United States in 1991.  The Government of Kuwait is an important\npartner in the ongoing U.S. led campaign against international terrorism, providing\nassistance in the military, diplomatic and intelligence arenas and also supporting efforts\nto block financing of terrorist groups.  In terms of dealing with terrorists, Kuwait still lacks\nthe strong legal provisions to deal effectively with those engaged in conspiracy to\ncommit terrorist acts.  The Kuwaiti government continues to strengthen its legal regime\nfor combating money laundering and terrorist financing, but problems persisted,\nparticularly with enforcement.  Although money laundering was a criminal offense,\nterrorist financing was not specifically prohibited.  Kuwait engaged in Human Rights\nabuses, including granting no right to change government or to form political parities,\nrestrictions of freedom of speech and the press, assembly and association of religion;\ncorruption; trafficking in person and the unequal rights of women.  Kuwait is a\ndestination for trafficked women and instances of trafficking were reported during the\nperiod.  Kuwait is a Sunni Islam dominated society.  Shi\u2019s are free to worship however,\naccording to their faith without government interference, and the overall situation for\nShi\u2019s remain stable.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n5\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (b) the is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal or the\nindividual has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n6\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence and has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S., 8(b) there is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal or the individual has deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest, and 8(c) contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant has many family members who are residents and citizens\nof Kuwait, the Applicant is not close to any of them.  The exception is  his mother with\nwhom he has minimal contact by telephone, that ranges from once a month to once\nevery six months.  The other relatives, include seven sisters, a brother and three\nbrother-in-laws.  Some of them he has never met, and others with whom he has never\ntalked or has superficial conversations with about once a year when they are at his\nmothers house when he calls her.  Although some of his relatives work for the Kuwait\ngovernment in some capacity, none of his relatives have knowledge of what the\nApplicant does for a living nor who he works for.  Furthermore, they do not have any\ncontact with the Applicant and therefore do not pose a security risk.  \nHere in the United States, the Applicant has a wife and two sons who are native\nAmerican citizens.  He has spent the last thirty years of his life working hard to establish\nhimself as a responsible, educated, productive United States citizen.  He has made\ngreat contributions to the Defense Department as evidence by his many awards and\ncommendations.  He has adopted the American way of life as his own as evidenced by\nhis many favorable recommendations from American comrades who speak so highly on\nhim.  Clearly, his deep and abiding ties are here in the United States.  His employment\nwith the DoD and his assets are all in the United States.  He has never returned to\nKuwait since coming to the United States in 1978.  The Applicant essentially cut all ties\nfrom Kuwait when he moved to the United States at the age of twenty-one and made it\nhis permanent home.  \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Kuwait elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond and\naffection with her foreign family members or to any foreign individual or to Kuwait in any\n\n8\nway that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, there is no possibility of\nforeign influence that exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.e.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.f.:  For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.g.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 24 October 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F.  Applicant answered the SOR 11 December 2008, and requested a\n1\ndecision without hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 12 March 2009. The record in\nthis case closed 9 March 2009, the day Department Counsel entered no objection to\nApplicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nMarch 30, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. She is a 55-year-old, thrice\ndivorced, principal quality engineer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since June\n2007. She has not previously held an industrial clearance, but had a clearance while\nshe was in the military from 1978 to 1995.\nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and government exhibits substantiate, 18\ndelinquent debts totaling over $16,000. Applicant accrued these debts after filing for\nchapter 7 bankruptcy protection in July 1995, and receiving a discharge of her\ndischargeable debts in November 1995. \nApplicant married her first husband in February 1976, and they divorced in\nJanuary 1978. They had no children. She married her second husband in July 1978,\njust before she entered the military. They had two children together, a boy born in\nDecember 1980 and a girl born in December 1983. They divorced in August 1985. She\nmarried her third husband in October 1994, retired from the military in January 1995,\nfiled for bankruptcy in July 1995, received her bankruptcy discharge in November 1995,\nand divorced in May 1996. They had no children.\nApplicant served in the military from December 1978 to January 1995. Although\nthe record does not reflect the circumstances under which she achieved retired status,\nshe proved her entitlement to retired benefits, including medical benefits until she\nreaches age 65. She has established that debts 1.a., b., f., h., I., j., and o. are medical\nexpenses and claims the military medical benefits program should have covered these\nexpenses. However, there is no evidence indicating the providers submitted the claims\nto the program, indicating Applicant ensured they were submitted to the program, or\nindicating whether the amounts alleged as past due represent amounts owed by the\nprogram or co-payments required to be paid by Applicant. Applicant is encountering\ndifficulty trying to get information from the providers or the medical program.\nApplicant proved that debt 1.l was paid no later than January 2008, when the lien\nholder released the lien. She claims to have paid debt 1.g., but provided no\ncorroboration. She asserts that debt 1.n. is a joint credit card she held with her father,\nwho died in July 2002. She states that she is seeking to have the account removed from\nher credit report, but it is not clear on what legal basis she can do so. Whether she\nmade the charges or not, she is as legally responsible for the debt as her father (or his\nestate). She has made additional claims regarding the status of other debts, but\nprovided no corroboration. She alleges that debt 1.c. was due to identity theft. She\nalleges that the debt at 1.p. is not hers. She alleges that she has paid the debt at 1.q.\nShe proved that she had received a settlement offer from the creditor holding debt 1.d.\nfor a lump-sum payment of half the outstanding balance. She was unable to pay the\nlump sum, and has been unable to arrange either a reduced balance or a repayment\nschedule.\n\nThe government alleged the amount of this debt as $2,904, a number found nowhere in the record. The credit\n2\nreport documenting two timeshares (Applicant admitted buying two) shows two repossessed timeshares\ntotaling over $18,000.\n3\nApplicant states that debt 1.r. is for repossessed timeshares she bought in 2002.2\nShe claims she \u201cgave\u201d them to her ex-husband when she moved to a different state to\ntake her current job. He allegedly promised to pay the promissory notes on both\nproperties but did not. The record does not reflect which ex-husband she entrusted the\nproperties to, or why he would agree to the arrangement. The properties are listed as\nApplicant\u2019s individual obligation, she bought them six years after her most recent\ndivorce, and the arrangement with her ex-husband was apparently unwritten. The\nrecord contains no evidence of Applicant\u2019s military performance, employment\nreferences, or character references.\nIn her August 2007 subject interview, Applicant acknowledged living beyond her\nmeans for several years, largely because of her children. She also acknowledged that\nshe was overwhelmed by her debts, but was determined to satisfy them. In her March\n2009 response to the FORM she clarified that her debts were attributable to her\ndivorcing her husband shortly after retiring from the military. He became addicted to\npain medication after an accident, and left her and the children, forcing her to cope with\ntwo houses, two cars, and four credit cards. She ultimately filed for bankruptcy as\nabove. However, except for the joint card with her father, all the delinquent accounts\nlisted in her credit reports are listed as individual accounts.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM appears to conflate the circumstances of her\nlast two divorces in attributing her living beyond her means to circumstances beyond\nher control. After her divorce from her second husband in August 1985, she was a\nsingle mother with two small children to raise. There is no evidence of a child support\nobligation for the second husband. Debts incurred between August 1985 and October\n1994 would appear to have been her sole obligation. The opportunity for joint debt with\nher third husband was limited to a fairly short period after their October 1994 marriage,\nand in any event should have been discharged as to her in her November 1995 single\ndebtor bankruptcy discharge. The youngest of Applicant\u2019s children reached the age of\nmajority in 2001. Applicant consulted with a bankruptcy attorney in April 2008. He\nrecommended a chapter 13 repayment plan, but Applicant decided to try to resolve as\nmany debts as she could before proceeding with that course of action.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n4\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n5\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620 (c)the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n4\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties, which are ongoing.  She received a complete discharge of her\n4\ndischargeable debt in November 1995, six months before she was divorced from her\nthird husband. Yet, she has continued to accrue delinquent debt. Right now, her\nfinances are a shambles, and appear likely to remain so for some time.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  She has not established how the\n5\ndebts were due to circumstances beyond her control, and she has not acted responsibly\nin addressing her debts.  Her credit counseling has been limited to consulting with a\n6\nbankruptcy attorney, and she has not otherwise brought the problem under control.7\n\n\u00b620 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n5\nOnly one of her debts has been paid in a timely, good-faith effort.  Further, given that\n8\nshe has not sought or used effective financial counseling, there is nothing in the record\nto suggest that Applicant will put her financial problems behind her. I conclude Guideline\nF against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is field engineer for a\ndefense contractor.  He was honorably discharged from the Air Force in 2000.

In October 2005, after his retirement\nfrom active duty, Applicant was arrested on an Air Force base for the offenses of invasion of privacy\n(looking into the window of a female\u2019s on-base guestroom without her knowledge) and resisting\narrest.  He pled guilty to invasion of privacy and the second charge was dropped.  He was fined $375.\nAfter the case, Applicant attended a fellowship sponsored by his church, the content of which\nwas sexual contact temptations.  It did not specifically address voyeurism, nor was it part of a court-\nordered treatment program.  Among other things, the program addressed ways of avoiding such\ntemptations.  Applicant discussed his misconduct with his fellow attendees.  Applicant\u2019s supervisors\nand fellow workers rate his job performance highly.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s documentary\nevidence of good character, the Judge stated that these documents do not reflect that the persons\nwriting them were aware of Applicant\u2019s misconduct.    \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Applicant argues that the Judge mistakenly believed that the\nchurch program he attended was mandatory rather than voluntary.  However, neither the record nor\nthe Judge\u2019s decision provides a basis to conclude that the Judge erred in his treatment of this matter.\nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s testimony concerning this program was confusing, citing, for\nexample, Applicant\u2019s apparently contradictory statements as to whether he had informed his fellow\ncongregants of his conviction.  The record provides no basis to conclude that the Judge mis-weighed\nthe evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 08-07005 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009) (\u201cAs the trier of fact, the\n\n3\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa\u201d). The facts and circumstances of the fellowship meeting,\ncontradictory testimony by Applicant concerning it, and Applicant\u2019s demeanor while testifying are\nproper matters for the Judge to consider, both as to a credibility determination and to the question\nof rehabilitation.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32 (The Board defers to the Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations); and Directive \u00b6 E2.32 (d) (Guideline J security concerns can be mitigated by an\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrating that \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation\u201d).  \nThe record demonstrates that the Judge has considered the entire record, including the matters\nsubmitted by Applicant.  The Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found and his\nultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as regards the mitigating conditions and the whole-\nperson factors.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

On May 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under criminal conduct\n(Guideline J). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant furnished his answer to the SOR on May 30, 2008.

Applicant testified. Applicant\u2019s exhibits\n(AE) A through F were admitted in evidence without objection. After the hearing,\nApplicant submitted a character statement from his supervisor (AE G). On October 2,\n2008, the government indicated they did not object to AE G. DOHA obtained a copy of\nthe hearing transcript on September 18, 2008. The record in this case closed on\nOctober 2, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRulings on Procedure\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits have been reorganized as follows:\nAE A:\n2007/2008 performance evaluation\nFive year certificate of Recognition, undated\nThreat System team award, March 21, 2006\nAE B:  \nTwo character statements, dated January 17, January 23, 2006\nAE C:\nBachelor of Science degree, May 12, 2006\nAssociate of Science degree, May 12, 2006\nDean\u2019s List, January 20, 2006\nDean\u2019s List, (twice in 2002)\nHonor Roll, April 20, 1999\nAE D:\nCertificate of recognition to position of Deacon, July 27, 2008\nA religious play (one page)\nCertificate of Appreciation for membership with Team, 2007\nService Award for church Team Leader\nCertificate of Training, April 15, 2007\nAE E:\nDD 214, August 31, 2000\nUSAF, Certificate of Appreciation, February 18, 1998\nLetter of recognition, November 27, 1995\nCertificate of Appreciation, September 14, 1995\nCertificate of Achievement, May 8, 1995\nAF Commendation Medal, 32 month period ending in November\n1991\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted both criminal conduct (Guideline J) allegations. Applicant is 41\nyears old. In September 2000, Applicant received an Honorable discharge from the\nUnited States Air Force (USAF) (AE D). He has been employed as a field engineer for a\ndefense contractor since November 2000. He married his current wife in February 1989,\nand has one child. His nephew lives with him too. \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nDuring the months of May and June 1987, Applicant was 26 years old, and in the\nUSAF. On two or three occasions (Tr. 51) during those two months, he entered the\nshower area of the female barracks (SOR 1.a.) for the purpose of secretly watching\nwomen take showers. On September 13, 1987, Applicant received non-judicial\npunishment as follows: (1) reduction in grade to Sergeant; (2) forfeiture of $200.00 in\npay for 2 months; (3) 30 days correctional custody effective August 31, 1987. Applicant\nrecalled taking a battery of tests following this non-judicial punishment, but never\nreceived therapy (Tr. 89).\nOn October 24, 2005, Applicant was arrested for invasion of privacy and resisting\narrest, after entering a military installation about 6:30 A.M., and looking in the window of\na female\u2019s guestroom, unbeknownst to the female (GE 3). Applicant had some difficulty\nproviding a chronological account of his conduct before the offense. He did recall the\noffense occurred about 6:30 A.M. because he had just dropped his nephew at the\nairport, and was on his way to the dining facility (Tr. 71). He estimated he was at the\nwindow from three to five minutes when the building manager surprised him, and asked\nhim for identification. (Tr. 67-68). Not wanting to show his identification, Applicant began\nto run away, but then stopped, and the police placed him under arrest. \nApplicant pled guilty to invasion of privacy and the second charge was dropped\n(Tr. 61). On May 1, 2006, Applicant was fined $375.00 (Id.).\nSome time after Applicant was fined, he participated in two-month fellowship\nsponsored by his church, with meetings once a week. The fellowship had nothing to do\nwith Applicant\u2019s May 2006 conviction. Rather, the church leaders decided to sponsor\nthe program. The topic of discussion was sexual contact temptations (Tr. 73), and the\nsituations in which temptation can arise. The fellowship did not specifically deal with\nvoyeurism. Later in the meetings, the topic switched to ways to avoid temptation. \nThe solutions to the sexual temptation included promising not to look at\nsomething a person is not supposed to look at, reading the bible, and praying more (Tr.\n74). Applicant prays more and reads the bible more (Tr. 74-75). \nApplicant agreed that voyeurism involves the act of looking at unsuspecting\nfemale strangers in some stage of undress (Tr. 77). Applicant claims he never engaged\nin sexual gratification, i.e., masturbating, while watching these women because he was\nalways on his way somewhere (Tr. 78). He also claimed he never thought about the\nwomen later to arouse sexual excitement because he was again on his way somewhere\n(Id.). Later in his testimony, he was asked whether he deferred sexual gratification of\nthe incident to a subsequent time, He stated:\nIt wasn\u2019t so much that, you know, saying that I didn\u2019t have time like I was\noh I don\u2019t have time to do this no it\u2019s just I was, I would do what I was\ndoing and then keep on going, it wasn\u2019t, so much later on that I was by\nmyself or anything because I had, because I was not in a room by myself I\nwas, you know, I had a roommate (Tr. 107).\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nApplicant surmised that his voyeurism in 1987 was triggered by his military\nlifestyle at his temporary duty location during the period. A substantial part of the time\nhe and other soldiers were involved in sexual activity characterized by gathering at bars\nand picking up women (Tr. 80), and an activity that was not a part of his teenage years\nin his religious household. \nThe activity in 2005 was the only other time Applicant claimed he engaged in the\nvoyeuristic behavior. He blamed the 2005 offense on his lifestyle with his wife becoming\ntoo routine (Tr. 81, 126). \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about informing other members of the two-month fellowship\nis confusing. He initially stated that one person became aware of his conviction in 2005\n(Tr. 82), but then he testified that he explained the activity generally to the group in the\nlast week of the fellowship. He stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t describe a conviction, I just told them\nabout the incident as far as voyeuristic type of behavior stuff like that, I didn\u2019t talk about\ncourt cases or anything like that (Tr. 84).\u201d Applicant did not feel he had to tell the entire\ngroup about his behavior because he was satisfied that his accountability partner knew\nthe full details. There is no additional information in the record about what he told his\naccountability partner.\nWhen asked again to explain why he did not provide the whole story to the\nfellowship participants rather than a general account of his behavior, Applicant stated:\nI don\u2019t remember the exact wording but I did talk about, I wouldn\u2019t say\ngeneral, I\u2019d just say I talked about two incidents that happened in my life\nand I didn\u2019t talk about, you know, what happened in, you know, like a\nparticular day or anything like that I didn\u2019t go into that much detail. I just\ntalked about the two incidents that had happened in my life (Tr. 86). \nApplicant regrets he engaged in the sexual activity. He is also remorseful for his\nconduct (Tr. 87).\nApplicant considers that he does not meet the diagnosis of voyeurism because\nhe is not having significant stress in social, occupational or other areas of functioning,\nas demonstrated by his excellent performance evaluations (Tr. 95-96).\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s performance rating for 2007 to 2008 is 3.85 on a 4-point rating\nsystem. He received a monetary reward in April 2008 for his support of the a project. He\nalso received a certificate for five years of service with his employer. \nA, Applicant\u2019s friend of 12 years, stated that while in the military, Applicant was\nrecognized for his leadership ability. According to A, Applicant\u2019s competence in trouble\nshooting and monitoring of telecommunications make him a real asset. A was not aware\nof Applicant\u2019s behavior in 2005 when he wrote this character statement in January 2006\n(Tr. 93).\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nB, Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, who has known him for five years, believes\nApplicant does good work in programming life saving equipment used in the USAF\naircraft. B believes Applicant is a devoted family man and very active in his church. The\ncharacter statement does not indicate whether B was aware of Applicant\u2019s behavior in\n2005 when he wrote his character statement in January 2006. \nApplicant received his Bachelor of Science and Associate of Science degree in\nMay 2006. Applicant\u2019s scholarship has been recognized. Applicant\u2019s contributions to his\nchurch on July 27, 2008 were recognized with his appointment as deacon. Applicant\nreceived several acknowledgments for his contribution to the church drama production,\nand in completing certain religious courses. \nBetween 1991 and February 1998, Appellant received five letters and/or awards\nfrom the military appreciating his job performance and service. \nHaving weighed and balanced the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s demeanor\nat the hearing, I find his confusing testimony describing his fellowship experience\nundermines his overall credibility. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\n30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \nIf the offense in August 1987 and the one in October 2005 had been two\ncompletely different types of crimes, whatever security concerns that were generated by\nthe 1987 conduct may have been mitigated by the passage of 18 years. However,\nApplicant committed the same offense in October 2005 by secretly viewing a woman at\nsome state of undress. Applicant\u2019s commission of the two offenses falls within the scope\nof Criminal Conduct (CC) disqualifying condition (DC) 31.a. (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) and CC DC 31.c. (allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted).\nThere are two mitigating conditions (MC) potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case. CC MC 32.a. (so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment). Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior in 1987 generates continuing security concerns\nbecause he employed the same modus operandi in the 2005 offense. In each offense,\nApplicant viewed women in different stages of undress. The recency of the 2005\noffense engenders continuing concerns about his judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. CC MC 32 a. is not applicable.\nCC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) In assessing the significant evidence in rehabilitation, I find\nmost of the Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is directed at his military performance, job\nperformance and his church affiliation. Though Applicant talked at length about how the\nfellowship was an illuminating experience for him in terms of how to avoid sexual\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\ntemptations, he equivocated about what he told the fellowship participants and his\naccountability partner.\nApplicant\u2019s apparent inability to be forthright with members of his church about\nhis criminal behavior is important because it suggests that he has not come to grips with\nhis criminal conduct. His lack of frankness discredits his assertions of remorse for the\ncriminal behavior. The limited mitigation Applicant receives under CC MC 32.d. is\ninsufficient to prevail over the disqualifying evidence under CC DC 31.a. and 31.c.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors define the WPC\nare: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nWhile Applicant presented an abundance of evidence showing a praiseworthy\nmilitary and civilian job career, and impressive contributions to his church, his claim of\nhaving modified his criminal conduct is not supported by the record. Though friend A\nfurnished a great character statement for Applicant, friend A was not aware of\nApplicant\u2019s 2005 criminal behavior when he wrote the statement. Applicant\u2019s ambiguous\nexplanations for his conduct in 1987 and 2005, together with his lack of forthrightness\nwith fellow parishioners during the fellowship and at the hearing, preclude successful\nmitigation in this case. I cannot say with complete confidence there will be no\nrecurrence of his adverse conduct in the future. Upon consideration of this case in light\nof the whole person model, Applicant\u2019s security clearance application is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant\nand the other two witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact: \nApplicant is 48 years old. She is currently unmarried, and she has four children.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 14 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.n., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the debts will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $201.\nApplicant testified that this debt has been paid, and Exhibit E confirms that this debt has\nbeen paid. The most current credit report (cr) also confirms that this debt has been paid\n(Exhibit 8). \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $62.\nApplicant testified that this debt has been paid, and the most current cr also confirms\nthat this debt has been paid (Exhibit 8). \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $770.\nApplicant testified that this debt has been paid, although she had no documentation to\nprove it. While it is not clear, it appears that Exhibit 8 also shows that this debt has been\nresolved.  \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $68.\nApplicant testified that she has contacted the collection agency for this debt, but they\ndid not have a record of her owing this debt. She indicated that she was planning to pay\nthe debt, but has been unable to do so.  I conclude that this debt has not been paid in\nfull, but not as a result of Applicant\u2019s wrongful action.   \n \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $233 for\na medical bill. In her RSOR, Applicant stated that she had paid this bill, and she was\n\n3\nwaiting for a proof of payment to be sent to her. Exhibit 8 shows that a payment of $233\nwas made for a medical bill, so it appears that this debt has been resolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $12,222\nfor a judgement for child support. In her RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant\nreiterated that this debt has been paid. Her attachment to the RSOR, and Exhibit 8\nconfirm that this debt has been paid.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $427. In\nher RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant reiterated that this debt has been paid.\nHer attachment to the RSOR, and Exhibit 8 confirm that this debt has been paid.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $164. In\nher RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant reiterated that this debt has been paid.\nHer post hearing submission confirms that this debt has been paid (Exhibit L).\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,460.\nThis debt arose, because a vehicle owned by Applicant was towed and stored. She did\nnot remember that the vehicle had been towed, and the fee for the towing and storage\ncontinued to grow. Applicant estimated the value of this old vehicle at either $600 or\n$700. She has contacted this creditor, but thus far they refuse to negotiate a more\nreasonable amount for settlement, even though the creditor has retained the vehicle.\nShe indicated that she will attempt to renegotiate the debt again so that she may\nresolve the debt.   \n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $491. In\nher RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant reiterated that this debt has been paid.\nHowever, no documentation was introduced to confirm that this debt has been paid.\n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $713.\nIn her RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant reiterated that this debt has been\npaid. Her attachment to the RSOR, and Exhibit B confirm that this debt has been paid.\n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$21,116. In her RSOR and during the hearing, Applicant testified that this debt is for a\nvehicle that is in the possession of her ex-boyfriend. While they were together, she and\nthis boyfriend had made an agreement that he would use the vehicle that had been\npurchased in her name, as long as he made the payments on the vehicle. After they\nseparated, he stopped making the required monthly payments, but he refused to return\nthe vehicle to her, and as far as she is aware, the vehicle is still in his possession. While\nshe is still legally responsible for the payments of this debt, she has contacted both the\ncreditor and the police to attempt to explain and resolve this debt. She testified that she\nwas informed by the creditor that they would attempt to work out a payment plan with\nher ex-boyfriend, but apparently they did not do so. Applicant indicted in her RSOR that\nshe intended to file a civil suit against her ex-boyfriend to recover the amount owed  for\nthis debt. \n\n4\n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $200.\nIn her RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant reiterated that this debt has been\npaid. No documentation was introduced to confirm that this debt has been paid.\nHowever, since this debt is not included in the most current cr, it may have been\nresolved (Exhibit 8).\n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $373. \nIn her RSOR and during her testimony, Applicant reiterated that this debt has been\npaid. Exhibits I and 8 confirm that this debt has been paid.\n1.o. This allegation was amended at the time of the hearing, and struck from the\nSOR, with no objections raised from either party. I find that the allegation regarding\nwhat evidence Applicant introduced about each debt, is a question for me to resolve,\nand that is how it has been addressed.  \nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. In 1997, Applicant was charged with fraud to obtain over $400, perjury, and\ngrand theft over $400, for her failure to inform her social worker that she had become\nmarried.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she had initially left telephonic messages\nto the social worker to inform her that she had become married, but the social worker\ndid not contact her, and Applicant simply never followed up to inform her of the\nmarriage.  She appeared in court and pled no contest to a lesser charge, and she was\nordered to repay public assistance benefits that she had wrongfully received in the\namount of $400. She was not sentenced to any other restrictions or punishment.\nApplicant testified that she was not aware that she received a payment to which she\nwas not entitled. \n2.b. In 2004, Applicant was sued and found liable for unpaid child support.\nApplicant explained that her daughter had lived with her until she was 13 or 14, and\neventually she moved in with Applicant\u2019s ex-sister-in-law. Applicant was providing some\nmoney for her daughter\u2019s support, but the ex-sister-in-law requested additional child\nsupport from the court, which Applicant was ordered to pay. As reviewed in paragraph\n1.f., above, Applicant has resolved this debt. \n2.c. Applicant executed a signed SCA on May 9, 2007 (Exhibit 1). Question 28.a.\nasks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nQuestion 28.b. asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both of these questions, and she listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed as 1.a. through\n1.n., discussed above in the SOR.\nApplicant testified that she was confused about these questions, and she is not\ncertain why she answered \u201cNo\u201d to both of these questions. She testified credibly that\n\n5\nshe had no intention of hiding information from the Government when she completed\nthe SCA (Tr at 78-82).\nApplicant explained that she and her fianc\u00e9e drive a long distance truck together.\nThey have been together for two years, and he has helped her to resolve her finances.\nThey pay their debts together, and they are not overdue on any of their current debts.\nThey each submitted post hearing income and expense statements that show a\nremainder of approximately $2,000 a month each after net income and expenses are\ntabulated (Exhibit N). Applicant testified that her previous financial difficulties were\nincurred primarily because as a mother of four children she did not have sufficient funds\nto pay all of her debts. She also conceded that at times she was not as thorough as she\nshould have been to make sure the debts  were resolved.   \nTwo witnesses testified at the hearing on Applicant\u2019s behalf, her daughter and\nher fiance.  Applicant\u2019s daughter, who is now 25 years old, testified that she lived with\nher aunt (Applicant\u2019s ex-sister-in-law) for eight or nine months and that during that time\nher mother continued to give her aunt $200 a month for her and to pay for her clothes\nand food.  There was no explanation for why the court ordered Applicant  to pay her ex-\nsister-in-law the $12,222, as reviewed in paragraph 1.f., above. She also confirmed that\nApplicant\u2019s ex-boyfriend has retained the vehicle, of which the purchase agreement was\nin Applicant\u2019s name, and he has not returned it. \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 testified that they have driven a truck together for the last two\nyears, and they also pay their bills together. He reiterated that together they are able to\nresolve all of their debts, and they do not have any current overdue bills. They plan to\nmarry in December 2008. \nFinally, Applicant submitted four character letters from individuals who have\nknown Applicant in a variety of settings (Exhibit M). They were all very positive\ndescribing Applicant as \u201cdependable,\u201d and \u201chard  working.\u201d  She also submitted a letter\nfrom the minister of her church, who wrote that Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 were enrolled in\na pre-marital counseling program with the stated intention of being married in December\nof 2008. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n6\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting financial\nobligations and her previous inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts. \nHowever, I find that Mitigating Condition (MC) (d) applies as Applicant has\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay the overdue creditors and resolve her debts. She\n\n7\nalso is not overdue on any of her current debts. I, therefore, hold Guideline F for\nApplicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, I find that Applicant testified credibly that she did not\nknowingly provide incorrect material information to the Government on the SCA that she\nexecuted on May 9, 2007. I also find that the $400 that she wrongfully received in 1997\nwas not due to any illegal or improper conduct. Finally, it is not clear why the court\nordered Applicant to pay such a substantial amount of child support in 2004, which\nbased on the testimony of Applicant and her daughter, appears to be unwarranted.\nRegardless, Applicant has paid the full amount of child support that was ordered by the\ncourt and fulfilled her legal requirements.  \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against\nApplicant. I therefore, resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including the testimony of her two character\nwitnesses and her significant attempt to resolve her overdue debts, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.: For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Lawrence Hicks, Esq. \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record as a whole, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn March 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 2, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on June 4, 2009, and \nissued a Notice of Hearing on June 16, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 9, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing on said date. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 4 into evidence, which were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B into evidence, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJuly 20, 2009.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nMotion to Amend \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend Paragraph 1.c of the \nSOR to read as follows: \u201cYour half-sister is a citizen of Afghanistan and a resident of \nPakistan.\u201d Applicant had no objection. The motion was granted. (Tr. 49) \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The request and the attached \ndocuments pertaining to Afghanistan are included in the record as Afghanistan Hearing \nExhibits (AHE) I through VIII. The request and the attached documents pertaining to \nPakistan are included in the record as Pakistan Hearing Exhibits (PHE) I through VIII. \nThe parties stipulated to the introduction of said documents. (Tr. 8) Hence, the facts \nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He was born in Afghanistan and attended high school \nthere. In 1977, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He later took \nadditional courses in management training and sales. While in college, he became \nfriends with some of his American professors and tutored their children in Dari. As \nrequired by the Afghanistan government, he served in its army for six months after \ncompleting his college education. Applicant speaks Dari, Pashto, Urdo, and Arabic, all \nMiddle Eastern languages. (Tr. 57) \n \n \nAfter the Afghanistan government was toppled by the Russian government in \n1979, Applicant left Afghanistan in May 1980 and immigrated to the United States. He \ninitially stayed with his brother, who had left in 1968 and had become a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. In 1984, Applicant married his wife, an American citizen.  He became a \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in October 1985. They have two children who were born in the \nUnited States. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Afghanistan. They are deceased. He has a \nsister and brother, two step-sisters, and one step-brother from his father\u2019s previous \nmarriage. All were born in Afghanistan. His sister is a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan. His brother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1987 and resides in the \nUnited States. This brother is a translator for the U.S. Coalition Forces (Forces) and has \nbeen deployed to Afghanistan at least five times. One of his step-sisters is 83 years old \nand lives in Pakistan, but remains a citizen of Afghanistan. His other step-sister was \nliving in Pakistan when she died in 2006. Both step-sisters fled to Pakistan when the \nwar broke out in Afghanistan. (Tr. 55) His step-brother became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 1979 and resides in the United States. He has nieces and nephews who are \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan. \n \n \n  \nAfter arriving in the United States in 1980, Applicant worked for an electronics \ncompany for three years. He then joined an insurance company as a sales \nrepresentative. He has since become a licensed insurance agent and works as an \nindependent broker. (Tr. 59) \n \n \n \nApplicant learned of translator opportunities with the Coalition Forces through his \nbrother. In October 2004, he applied for a position with a federal contractor and \ncompleted a security clearance application. (GE 2) He was hired with an interim \nclearance and served the Forces in Afghanistan from July 2005 to March 2006. He then \nreturned home and resumed his work in the insurance industry. (GE 4 at 2) \n \n \nApplicant speaks with his sister, residing in Afghanistan, once or twice a year by \ntelephone. She is a housewife and her husband is a construction worker. Their children \nare students.  None of the family members work for the government. He has not seen \nher since 1997. She is aware of his work with the Forces.  (Tr. 40; GE 4 at 4) He speaks \nto his step-sister and their families once or twice a year by telephone. (GE 4 at 4) He did \nnot speak to or visit them while he was deployed to Afghanistan because he does not \nwant to jeopardize their well-being. (Tr. 46-47) He visited his sisters in Pakistan in 1991 \nand 1997, who were living in refugee camps at the time. He continues to speak to his \nstep-sister once or twice a year. (Id.)  Sometimes he and his brothers send money to \ntheir  sister and step-sister. (Tr. 49) \n \n \nApplicant owns a home in the United States and has U. S. bank accounts. (Tr. \n57-58)  His two children attend college. (Tr. 19) There is no derogatory information in \nthe record concerning his police or financial records. He has never been fired from a \njob. He has never been arrested. He has never used illegal drugs or been involved in an \nalcohol-related incident. (GE 1 and 2) \n \n \nApplicant submitted two exhibits, setting forth his accomplishments while working \nin Afghanistan. His team leader for seven months wrote: \u201cMuch of our mission is \ndependent on the translation skills of our interpreters. I have [Applicant] to thank for my \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nsuccesses in my role in tracking down and capturing insurgents, whose goals were to \nupset the fine balance of the new transitional government of Afghanistan.\u201d (AE A)  \nApplicant\u2019s Commanding Officer from November 2005 to March 2006 believes Applicant \nis one of the best interpreters with whom he has worked. He stated that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cwork in an extremely sensitive position has been nothing short of spectacular. He is \ntrusted by the chain of command and more importantly by the citizens of two provinces.\u201d \n(AE B)   \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship.  He stated: \n \n I left Afghanistan. I\u2019m not a citizen of that country. I don\u2019t have any loyalty. \nI have nothing left there except my two sisters. I have my family here, \nback in America. And as you can see, the size of my family here in \nAmerica, and I\u2019m proud of my family. And I\u2019m proud to be an American \ncitizen. And I will uphold the law and the Constitution of the United States \nof America. (Tr. 62) \n \nAfghanistan \n \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Afghanistan Hearing \nExhibits.  Afghanistan is a country in southwestern Asia. Pakistan borders it on the east \nand the south.  Iran borders it on the west and Russia in the north.  It is a rugged and \nmountainous country which has been fought over by powerful nations for centuries. It \nhas about 18 million people. Afghanistan is presently an Islamic Republic that has had a \nturbulent political history, including an invasion by the Russians in 1979.  After an \nAccord was reached in 1989 and Russia withdrew from the country, fighting continued \namong the various ethnic, clan and religious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban \nrose to power and controlled 90% of the country, imposing aggressive and repressive \npolicies. In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in \nthe country, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The new democratic \nGovernment took power in 2004 after a popular election. Despite that election, terrorists \nand the Taliban continue to assert power and intimidation within the country. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record remains poor and violence is rampant. According to \nrecent reports from the U.S. Department of State, insurgents continue to plan attacks \nand kidnappings of Americans and other Western nationals. Travel warnings are \nongoing. No section of Afghanistan is safe or immune from violence. (AHE V)  \n \nPakistan \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Pakistan Hearing Exhibits.  \nPakistan is a parliamentary federal republic, created in 1947 after British India was \npartitioned when the British government granted India its independence.  Pakistan was \ncreated for the Moslem population of the Indian sub-continent. Its population is about 60 \nmillion. It has a coalition government led by a prime minister and president elected in \n2009.  After September 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed it relations with the Taliban and \nsupported the U.S. and international coalition in its efforts to remove the Taliban from \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npower.  Many Islamic extremists and terrorists are known to inhabit parts of Pakistan, \nleading to a growth of their insurgency.  Although Pakistan has intensified its efforts to \ndeal with the violence and terrorists, the country continues to experience serious \nproblems. The U.S. Department of State confirms that many borders are known as safe  \nhavens for terrorists. Numerous suicide bombings and kidnappings have taken place \nover the past couple years. Human rights violations continue to be a significant problem, \nas killings, torture, and disappearances remain prevalent. The Pakistani government \nmaintains domestic intelligence services.  The U.S. government warns Americans \nagainst travel to Pakistan.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n6\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for foreign influence are set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and, \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nSince leaving Afghanistan, Applicant periodically telephones his two sisters, one \nresiding in Afghanistan and the other residing in Pakistan. Both are citizens of \nAfghanistan. He also speaks to his nieces and nephews periodically.  One of his sisters \nknows that he worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s connections \nto his family in Afghanistan and half-sister in Pakistan could create a potential conflict of \ninterest between his security obligations and desire to help them, only in a situation \nwherein they were taken hostage or otherwise threatened with harm if he did not \ncooperate with terrorists or their governments. None of his family members have \npositions in which they could otherwise benefit from his access to sensitive information \nor technology. However, under either disqualifying condition, security concerns in this \ncase could arise in connection with the potential that hostile forces might seek protected \ninformation from Applicant by threatening harm to his family members in Afghanistan or \nPakistan.  \n  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifying conditions, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the \nresulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Those with potential application in this case are:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe current positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family members in Afghanistan \nand Pakistan do not involve the government or military and they would have no interest \nin acquiring protected information. Only their physical presence creates the potential \nthat their interests could be threatened to the point that Applicant would confront a \nchoice between their interest and those of the United States. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) has \nsome application.   \n \nApplicant produced significant evidence establishing AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his \nrelationship and depth of loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. He has lived in the United States since \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n1980 and did not return to Afghanistan until his employment with the U. S. Coalition \nForces in July 2005. However, he did visit Pakistan in 1991 and 1997. His wife and \nchildren are U.S. citizens, residing in the United States. He owns property and holds \nbank accounts in the United States. He is a licensed insurance agent and has owned \nhis own insurance agency for a number of years. There is no evidence that he owns \nproperty in Afghanistan or Pakistan.  He has limited contact with his two sisters and \ntheir families, living in Pakistan and Afghanistan. While in Afghanistan, he has willingly \nrisked his life to support the U.S. efforts. There is no evidence that he has connections \nor contact with any people other than his family members. He refers to himself as an \n\u201cAmerican.\u201d \n \nApplicant maintains ongoing, albeit sporadic, communication with his sisters and \nother relatives in both countries. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(c) cannot apply, as those contacts are \nsufficiently frequent and not casual.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The Appeal Board \nrequires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his [or \nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, \n2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Three circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Afghanistan and Pakistan. More importantly for security \npurposes, terrorists are hostile to the United States and actively seek classified \ninformation. Terrorists and friendly governments could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nsiblings and family to obtain such information. Second, he had numerous connections to \nAfghanistan before he immigrated to the United States in 1980. Following his birth, he \nspent his formative years there. He was educated at an Afghanistan college. Third, one \nsister and her family are citizens and residents of Afghanistan, and his step-sister is a \nresident of Pakistan.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 29 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen for almost 24 years. His spouse and children are U.S. \ncitizens. Both of his brothers are naturalized U.S. citizens and residents. Out of his \nsense of patriotism for the United States in its endeavors in Afghanistan, he worked for \nthe U.S. Forces as a translator. His brother holds a similar position. His ties to the \nUnited States, which he refers to as his country, are much stronger than his ties to his \nsiblings or families living in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is no evidence he has ever \ntaken any action that could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes his \nloyalty to the United States seriously, and he has worked diligently and impressively for \nthree years in an important capacity for the U.S. efforts. His supervisors and colleagues \nassess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and responsible, giving him excellent \nevaluations and praising his dedication to the cause of freedom in Afghanistan. He is a \ngood family member and U.S. citizen. After leaving Afghanistan in 1980, he never \nreturned until he worked with the U.S. forces in 2005.  \n \n No witnesses recommended denial of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no \nderogatory information about him in the record. There is evidence that he has \nsuccessfully worked in high-risk circumstances and made significant contributions to the \nUnited States in its efforts in Afghanistan. He credibly asserted his allegiance to the \nUnited States. \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during his tenure in Afghanistan \nwithout any indication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact \nis not normally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board \nnoted in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the national security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s commendable \nperformance as a translator and advisor in Afghanistan, I conclude Applicant has fully \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.2 Overall, the record \nevidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising under Guideline B.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                             \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                            \n2I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security \nclearance. Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person \nanalysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges 29 debts totaling more than $23,000.00 under the financial considerations guideline. SOR 1.i. through cc. (22 debts) are delinquent medical accounts representing treatment costs following Applicant\u2019s stroke in 2005, and periodic blood tests to ensure the proper blood density in her system. Applicant admitted all allegations except for SOR 1.a. and 1.f. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant, 50 years old, divorced, has twin daughters 25 years old, whom she no longer supports. She has been employed as a quality control production clerk since 2001. She also is a manager of a military community services organization. She seeks a public trust position. Applicant opened two credit card accounts in 2001 or 2002. She was making timely payments on them. Suddenly, she noticed the creditors were charging her late fees and claiming that her payments were delinquent (GE 3). Some time later in 2001 or 2002, Applicant discovered that her former husband took her credit cards out of state, and used them to pay company bills. He told her the company would repay her, but never did (Tr. 21-22).

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on June\n11, 2007. On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on August 22, 2008. Her\nanswer did not include responses to the last six allegations of the SOR. On August 29,\n2008, she submitted an addendum with responses to the last six SOR allegations.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5, 2008 for a hearing on November 20,\n2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4)\nwere admitted in evidence without objection to support the government\u2019s case. \nMarch 3, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant testified and submitted three exhibits. (AE A through C) In the time\nallowed for Applicant to furnish additional documentation, she submitted AE D through\nJ. The additional documentation provides an additional character statement, payment of\ntwo medical bills on December 5, 2008, correspondence from the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS), and updated requests for payment from several of the creditors listed in\nthe SOR. DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.) of the proceedings on December\n8, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges 29 debts totaling more than $23,000.00 under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. SOR 1.i. through cc. (22 debts) are delinquent medical\naccounts representing treatment costs following Applicant\u2019s stroke in 2005, and periodic\nblood tests to ensure the proper blood density in her system. Applicant admitted all\nallegations except for SOR 1.a. and 1.f. After a thorough review of the record, I make\nthe following findings of fact.\nApplicant, 50 years old, divorced, has twin daughters 25 years old, whom she no\nlonger supports. She has been employed as a quality control production clerk since\n2001. She also is a manager of a military community services organization. She seeks a\npublic trust position. \nApplicant opened two credit card accounts in 2001 or 2002. She was making\ntimely payments on them. Suddenly, she noticed the creditors were charging her late\nfees and claiming that her payments were delinquent (GE 3). \nSome time later in 2001 or 2002, Applicant discovered that her former husband\ntook her credit cards out of state, and used them to pay company bills. He told her the\ncompany would repay her, but never did (Tr. 21-22). Knowing her social security\nnumber, Applicant believes he opened two new credit card accounts and withdrew\nmoney from her bank account (Tr. 44). No additional information was provided. In 2003,\nApplicant received divorce paperwork in the mail from her former husband (Tr. 35).\nThe delinquent medical accounts were posted in Applicant\u2019s credit report when\nshe could not pay for medical services to treat her stroke in 2005. The cost of inpatient\ntreatment in July 2005 was $5,494.00 (GE 4). See also, SOR 1.h. The follow-up blood\ntests for her blood disorder amounted to $28.00 to $31.00 per test. (Tr. 16, 27-28). GE 4\nreflects that inpatient treatment for her stroke occurred in July 2005, followed by 20\nmedical bill entries reflecting blood tests since then. The most recent medical debt fell\ndelinquent in October 2007. During the time she had the stroke she was working for an\ninterim government contractor, and did not have medical insurance (Tr. 15-16). No\nadditional information was provided. Applicant did not indicate why she has not obtained\nother medical insurance since then. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s dispute with SOR 1.a. is that the state tax lien is her former\nhusband\u2019s responsibility. She received no correspondence from the state tax authority.\nSecondly, her state refund was never seized (Tr. 16-18), nor were her wages ever\ngarnished. In September 2005, she told the investigator she believed the tax problem\nwas caused by her former husband failing to pay the taxes for year 2002 (GE 3). In her\npost hearing submissions, she presented tax documentation from the IRS (AE F). She\nalso provided a one-page document which appears to be a printout from one of the\nthree credit agencies. It shows a state tax lien that was filed in November 1996 (AE J2).\nWhile I see an entry for a 1996 tax lien in GE 4 and AE J2, with the same dollar amount\nas in SOR 1.a., I am not persuaded this lien is Applicant\u2019s responsibility. I find for\nApplicant under this allegation.\nRegarding the credit card accounts alleged in SOR 1.b. through 1.d., and SOR\n1.g., GE 4 shows the credit cards became delinquent in 2003. Applicant has not been\nable to repay the credit card accounts because she has not had the money. When she\nlearned she was responsible for all the debts in 2005, she initially tried to avoid the\ncreditors because she was trying to make ends meet (Tr. 36-37). \nApplicant has never had counseling (Tr. 37), and could not establish payment\nplans with her creditors because they wanted their delinquent accounts repaid in a few\nlarge payment amounts Applicant did not have (Tr. 38). She indicated she was going to\nenroll in a credit counseling service in the week following the hearing, but was waiting\non her check so she could pay the enrollment fee of $60.00 (Tr. 39). Applicant\u2019s debt\ncounselor reported that she was trying to set up a debt plan for Applicant, and that the\nprocess would take time (AE H).\nApplicant denied SOR 1.f. because she claims in her government interview in\nJuly 2005 that she sold the car to the dealer for $9,300.00 (Tr. 22-23; GE 3). Further,\nshe indicated the lender agreed that the dealer\u2019s sale price of the car was sufficient to\nrelease the lien against her (Id.). I have reviewed her interview (GE 3) with the letter\nfrom the lender (AE J1). The $9,300.00 was supposed to be paid to the lender, not\nApplicant. Then, title to the car was to be released to the dealer, not Applicant.\nHowever, the government\u2019s only evidence to support 1.f. is a credit bureau report (GE\n4). I acknowledge the SOR 1.f. collection agency is listed in the exhibit, and that\nApplicant surmised the collection agency was trying to collect for the car. But,\nApplicant\u2019s speculative testimony is not enough to establish the connection between the\ncollection agency and the car. There is no evidence that ties the collection agency to the\ncar Applicant returned to a dealer in July 2005. Lacking the sufficient quantum of\nevidence to support the allegation, I find for Applicant under this allegation. \nHaving weighed and balanced the evidence as a whole, including Applicant\u2019s\ndemeanor and candor while testifying, the believability of her testimony is weakened by\nthe fact that the only documented payments of any of the SOR debts occurred on\nDecember 5, 2008, about 15 days following the hearing. Yet, at the hearing, Applicant\nprovided the impression that she had been making monthly payments to the medical\ncreditor\u2019s collection agency. She stated, \u201cMonthly payments every payday. I make sure\n\n4\nthey get paid off the same amount every pay (Tr. 16).\u201d Her personal financial statement\n(PFS) dated April 2008, appearing in GE 2, reflects that she has $170.00 remaining\nevery month after deducting her expenses ($1,370.00) and two monthly debt payments\n($410.00) from her net income of $1,950.00. Documented payments of only two debts in\nthe SOR undermines Applicant\u2019s credibility.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided several character references and certificates of recognition for\nher favorable work as a production clerk since 2000. The quality assurance leader\nindicated in a statement dated November 19, 2008, that based on working with\nApplicant since 2000, he considers her a valuable asset to his team (AE A). On\nDecember 5, 2008, the business manager at Applicant\u2019s employer extolled Applicant\u2019s\ndedication to team objectives (AE C). \nApplicant submitted 16 certificates of recognition for training and/or a good job\nperformance between February 2005 and July 2008. \nPolicies\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of\nDefense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I), entered\ninto a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which gave DOHA the responsibility to\nprovide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel working on unclassified\nInformation Systems Positions as defined in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated January 1987.\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the\nsecurity guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for ...\nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability and trustworthiness are such that ... assigning the person to sensitive\nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d The Regulation sets\nforth personnel security guidelines, disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline. In determining whether the applicant qualifies a sensitive position under the\ntrustworthiness standard, the applicant must be provided the due process procedures\ncontained in DoD Directive 5220.6.\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of each security\nguideline, the general factors of the whole person concept should be applied in deciding\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant an applicant eligibility\nfor assignment to sensitive duties. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. These guidelines are\nflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The\nadministrative judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense\ndecision. According to the AG, the entire process is a careful, thorough evaluation of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship is not restricted\nto normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock responsibility\nbetween an applicant and the federal government. The government reposes a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\n\n6\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nThe SOR lists a delinquent state lien, five credit card creditors, an unknown debt,\nand 22 medical accounts totaling more than $23,000.00. FC disqualifying condition (DC)\n19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies due to Applicant\u2019s inability to\npay the debts. FC DC 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) applies as the\ncredit report shows that the debts fell delinquent between 2003 and October 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition\n(MC) 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances); FC MC 20.c. (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control); and, FC MC 20.d. (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nFC MC 20.a. does not apply due to the number of debts and Applicant\u2019s failure to\ntake action much earlier than she actually did. FC MC 20.b. is applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case because Applicant suffered a stroke in July 2005 without\nmedical insurance. Since then, she also has had to obtain regular blood tests without\nmedical insurance. However, the mitigating weight that Applicant receives under FC MC\n20.b. is reduced by the passage of three years revealing that Applicant has paid only\ntwo of the medical debts. Her PFS reflects she had monthly funds available after\npayment of her expenses and debts. Yet, she decided not to use the funds to pay even\nsome of the smaller delinquent accounts. \nFC MC 20.c. does not apply. Applicant has had no financial counseling, and still\nowes most of the listed debts. Even though Applicant has not incurred any new\ndelinquent debt, there is no evidence showing her present financial problems are under\ncontrol. The same conclusion is made regarding FC MC 20.d. as payment of only two\ncreditors from the SOR is very little evidence of a good-faith effort to satisfy overdue\ncreditors, or to conclude Applicant is really serious about paying of her remaining\ncreditors. In sum, the mitigating evidence under FC MC 20.b. and 20.d., specifically the\ncharacter evidence disclosing Applicant\u2019s favorable job performance and teamwork\nattitude, does not overcome the negative evidence presented under FC DC 19.a. and\n19.c.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FI guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\n\n7\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the whole\nperson concept. Applicant was abandoned by her husband in 2001 or 2002 while she\ntrying to raise two children. He absconded with her two credit cards, and seriously\ndamaged her credit over the next few years. In July 2005, she had a stroke requiring\ntreatment and regular follow-up blood tests. Throughout the medical ordeal, she had no\nmedical insurance. However, three years have passed since her stroke. While the cost\nof the inpatient treatment following the stroke was more than $5,000.00, the cost for the\nblood test visits have not exceeded $31.00 a visit. \nApplicant was placed on notice in September 2005, June 2007, and April 2008\nthat her financial difficulties were a concern to the government. At the hearing, she\nstated she was making monthly payments to the collection agency for the medical\ndebts. Yet, the only documented evidence of payments is the two medical debt\npayments on December 5, 2008. With documented evidence showing that only two\naccounts in the SOR have been paid off, and the lack of any plan in place to address\nthe remaining creditors, Applicant\u2019s outstanding employment record is not sufficient for\nme to find in her favor under the FC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. through aa.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph bb.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph cc.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines G and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 26, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 22, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 2, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on February 18, 2009. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant offered exhibits (AE) that \nwere marked AE 1 through 7. Department Counsel had no objections and they were \nadmitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 23, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR on January 22, 2009, by withdrawing \nallegations 2.a, 2.b and 2.e of the SOR, and adding the following allegation under \nparagraph 2:  \n \n \n2.g. That information set forth under paragraph 1, above.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged the amendment and circled the response that referred to the \nanswer he previously provided.  \n \n \nAt the hearing I renumbered the allegations in paragraph 2 of the SOR in \nsequential order, reflecting the withdrawals and addition. Subparagraph 2.c is now 2.a; \n2.d is now 2.b; 2.f is now 2.c; and 2.g which was added is now 2.d.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. \nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \n1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and denies the remaining allegations. In addition, after a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and works as an information systems security officer for \na federal contractor. He was married in 1999 and divorced in 2004. He has an 11-year-\nold son from a prior relationship. After years of a custody dispute he was awarded full \ncustody of his son in April 2007. Applicant is a high school graduate and has earned \nsome college credits. He also earned different certifications as an information specialist. \nApplicant served in the Marine Corps from 1994 to 1999 and was honorably \ndischarged.1  \n \nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he consumed alcohol, at times \nto excess and to the point of intoxication from 1993 to June 2007. At his hearing he \ntestified that after 2005 he reduced his consumption of alcohol and has not been \nintoxicated since then. He now drinks one to three times a week; usually it is a drink \nwith dinner.2  \n \n \n \n \n1 Tr. 140-142. \n \n2 Tr. 79-80. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nIn 1993 Applicant was charged with Minor in Possession of Alcohol. He paid a \nfine.3 \n \nIn 1994 Applicant was charged with Public Intoxication of a Minor. The charge \nwas dismissed.4  \n \nIn September 1998 Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol (DUI) and Driving While Having a Measurable Blood Alcohol in his system. He \npled guilty to a reduced charge of Reckless Driving. He was sentenced to three years \nprobation. At the time he was in the Marine Corps and after this arrest he was \nspecifically ordered not to drink and drive and not to let this happen again.5 Applicant \nwent to an Article 15 Non-Judicial Punishment Hearing under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) in December 1998 for unauthorized absence and DUI. He \nreceived a reduction in rank, restriction, extra duties, and forfeitures.6  \n \nIn November 1998 Applicant was charged with DUI, Driving with a Blood Alcohol \nof .08% Alcohol, and Driving with a Suspended License DUI. He was found guilty and \nwas sentenced to 10 days of community service in lieu of confinement, five years \nprobation; attend an 18-month Multiple Conviction Program, revocation of his driver\u2019s \nlicense for a year, and fines and fees totaling approximately $2,500. Applicant explained \nthat this offense occurred the day after his grandfather died.7  \n \nApplicant received Non-Judicial Punishment from the Marine Corps in 1999 for \noffenses related to his November 1998 DUI charges. Specifically he was charged under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) at an Article 15 Hearing with Failure to \nReport to Appointed Place of Duty, Failure to Obey a Lawful Order, and Wrongfully \nOperating a Vehicle Under the Influence of Alcohol. He was ordered to be reduced in \nrank, forfeiture of pay, and restriction. Applicant acknowledged that there is a standing \norder in the Marine Corps not to drink and drive. Applicant was also directly ordered, \nafter his September 1998 DUI, not to drink and drive, which is the basis for the orders \nviolation. His Failure to Report to Duty was because he was being held by the police on \nthe DUI charge.  \n \nApplicant was attended alcohol counseling through the Marine Corps after this \nincident. He also attended court ordered alcohol treatment and counseling through the \nstate from November 1998 to June 2000. He completed the required alcohol programs.8  \n \n3 GE 1. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Tr. 84-86. \n \n6 GE 2. \n \n7 Tr. 89; AE 6. \n \n8 Tr. 86-88. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant made a sworn statement on May 20, 2004. He references \u201cDUI 98.\u201d He \ndoes not mention the September 1998 Reckless Driving conviction. Applicant explained \n\u201cI was drinking beer for a good part of the afternoon and evening when I then decided to \nstop drinking so that I could take a friend home. I stopped for about 2 hours and thought \nthat I was ok[ay] to drive.\u201d He was stopped by a police office while at a stop light \nbecause he threw a cigarette out of the window. He was pulled over and given a \nbreathalyzer and blew a .08%. He further stated: \u201cI have no future intentions o[f] driving \nwhile under the influence.\u201d9 \n \nIn 2004 Applicant was at a bar when a fight occurred outside. There were \napproximately 11 to 13 men assaulting one man. Applicant knew some of the men were \nMarines and attempted to break up the fight. Applicant had been drinking alcohol. The \npolice were called and Applicant was arrested along with others. Applicant stated that \nduring the fight he noticed that a ceramic \u201cdolphin\u201d figurine fell on the ground. He picked \nit up and put it in his pocket for safe keeping. After his arrest, he was searched and it \nwas determined the \u201cdolphin\u201d was a marijuana pipe. Applicant was charged with Public \nSwearing/Intoxication, Disorderly Conduct, and Possession of Marijuana. Appellant \nentered into a plea bargain. The plea deal consisted of the case being Nolle Prosequi in \nJune 2005.10 Applicant stated:  \n \nSo I was told that if I did the nolle prosequi that it would go off my record in \na year, and that I could have this expunged, and my attorney at the time \nbasically told me that this was not a concern to my clearance, because I \nasked him. I\u2019ve always been concerned about-I always want to do the right \nthing. So I asked is this going to affect my clearance. And he said, no, this \nshouldn\u2019t. We are going to get it expunged. It goes off your record.11  \n \n \nIn October 2005 Applicant was drinking alcohol with friends. He and his friends \nmoved their activities to another friend\u2019s place. He had more drinks while there and it \nwas about 2:00 to 3:00 a.m. He knew he had to drive home so he stopped drinking for a \ncouple of hours and went home about 5:00 a.m. While driving home Applicant had a \none vehicle accident and his vehicle ended up on its side in the ditch facing the wrong \ndirection. When the police arrived he was arrested and charged with DUI. He was \nconvicted and sentenced to 60 days, which was suspended, a fine, ordered to attend \nalcohol awareness education, and probation. Applicant testified he successfully \ncompleted the terms of his sentence. He attended and completed a 10-week court \nordered alcohol treatment program as was required. He did not attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous because he considered his latest DUI to be an isolated incident. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended, but has been reinstated since 2006.12  \n \n \n9 GE 5. \n \n10 Tr. 70-73, 91-105. \n \n11 Tr. 73-111. \n \n12 GE 8. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant believes his alcohol-related incidents relate to his private life. Applicant \nattempted to gauge how much he had to drink before he would drive. He would try and \nlimit his consumption to approximately one alcoholic beverage an hour before driving.13 \nApplicant referred to his September 1998 and November 1998 DUI\u2019s as isolated \nincidents with alcohol.  \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on February 28, \n2001.14 In response to question 24 which asked if he had ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs, he divulged the November 1998 \nDUI conviction. He did not divulge his September 1998 arrest and charge of DUI, which \nwas later reduced to Reckless Driving, for which he was convicted. Applicant admitted \nhe was drunk when he was arrested in September 1998. He admitted he was driving \nunder the influence of alcohol at the time of this arrest.15 In his answer to SOR, he \nstated:  \n \nI did not list the 9/98 incident because I was convicted of a Reckless \nDriving not an alcohol related conviction. Since going through this periodic \nreinvestigation I\u2019ve learned from the Security Investigators that I probably \nshould have listed the charges and explained the outcome even though I \nthought I was correct in only listing the conviction because the question \nasks, \u201cHave you ever been charged with OR convicted of any offense(s) \nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\u201d [T]herefore since the question used \u201cor\u201d I \ndidn\u2019t list this non-alcohol related conviction.16 \n \nApplicant testified he made a mistake when he did not list the September 1998 \nReckless Driving conviction, or he was not paying attention to detail, but he did not \nintentionally fail to report the offense. \n \nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to question 26 in his 2001 SCA, which asked him if in \nthe last seven years he had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any \noffense(s) not already listed.  \n \nQuestion 25 asked if he had been subject to court martial or other disciplinary \nproceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the past seven years. \nApplicant listed that he went to an Article 15 UCMJ Hearing on December 15, 1998. He \nlisted he was charged with disobeying an order. He listed no other offenses or any \nadditional Article 15 Hearings.17 In addition to the orders violation, he was also charged \n \n \n13 Tr. 81-83, 88-91, 123-127. \n \n14 GE 3. \n \n15 Tr. 113. \n \n16 Answer to SOR; Tr. 117-121. \n \n17 GE 3. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nwith unauthorized absence and operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. \nAll of these offenses occurred on September 2, 1998. Applicant failed to divulge these \noffenses. He also failed to divulge he went to a second Article 15 Hearing on July 1, \n1999, for failing to report to his appointed place of duty on November 12, 1998; failing to \nobey a lawful order issued by the Squadron Executive Officer; and wrongfully operating \na motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.18  \n \nNowhere on his SCA application did Applicant divulge the September 1998 DUI \ncharge and subsequent conviction of Reckless Driving. Applicant stated he made an \nhonest mistake and does not know why he left out the Reckless Driving charge. This is \ninconsistent with the systematic way the charge was not divulged in answering any of \nthe questions where it would have been appropriate. I find Applicant intentionally and \ndeliberately failed to divulge his Reckless Driving conviction. He was aware that he was \noriginally charged with an alcohol-related incident in September 1998 and was ordered \nby his Marine supervisors not to drink and drive after the incident. His attempt to explain \naway why he did not list this offense under question 24 might be reasonable if he had \nlisted in under question 26, which he did not.  \n \n \nApplicant completed another SCA on September 9, 2003. In response to \nquestion 24 requesting information about any alcohol or drug related arrests, charges or \nconvictions, Applicant only listed the November 1998 DUI conviction. In response to \nquestion 25 requesting information about any court martial or other disciplinary \nproceedings, he answered \u201cno.\u201d In response to question 26, asking if he had been \narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense not already listed, he answered \n\u201cno.\u201d In this SCA Applicant continued to be dishonest. He again only listed his \nNovember 1998 DUI conviction and not his September 1998 Reckless Driving \nconviction or either of his Article 15 hearings.19 His explanation was that he merely \ncopied his answers from his 2001 SCA. He also believed the question was \u201cout of \nscope\u201d. His explanation is not credible because he failed to provide the same answers. \nApplicant testified he made a mistake by failing to list the above mentioned required \ninformation on his 2001 and 2003 SCA. I find Applicant intentionally and deliberately \nfailed to divulge the required information.20 \n \nApplicant stated he contacted his attorney to see if had to divulge the 2004 \nmarijuana/disorderly conduct/public intoxication swearing arrest before he completed \nhis SCA in 2007. He stated his attorney told him the charge was not on his record and \nwas expunged. He asked his attorney if the Nolle Prosequi would affect his security \nclearance and he testified the attorney told him it would not. Applicant did not disclose \nthis arrest on his 2007 SCA. He stated he did not think he had to disclose it and he was \nfollowing the advice of his attorney. I do not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. \n \n \n18 GE 2.  \n \n19 GE 4. \n \n20 Tr. 128-135. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nQuestion 23(d) states: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) \nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d but only listed his 2005 DUI \nconviction. He did not list his 1998 DUI conviction or his 1998 Reckless Driving \nconviction, or any of his other alcohol-related arrests. 21 He also did not list his arrest for \nmarijuana possession/disorderly conduct/public swearing. Although he stated he was \nfollowing the advice of his attorney for why he did not list this arrest, I find his \nexplanation inconsistent because he failed to list his 1998 DUI and his 1998 Reckless \nDriving convictions. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23(f) which asked if he had been \narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed. He clearly was \naware he was arrested and charged with the 2004 drug and disorderly conduct \noffenses, even if the ultimate disposition was Nolle Prosequi. Applicant has exhibited a \ncontinuing course of deception beginning with his 2001 SCA continuing through his \n2007 SCA.   \n \n \nApplicant provided documents with his answer to the SOR and additional \ndocuments at his hearing regarding his Marine Corps service. Also included were a \npsychological evaluation, an alcohol treatment certificate, and character statements that \nwere considered. Those providing character statements expressed that Applicant is \nconsidered a model employee and has many admirable personal and professional \ncharacteristics. His work ethic, discipline, and motivation are exceptional. He is \nconsidered a dedicated professional and a person of integrity. He was recommended \nfor a position of trust.22  \n \n \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. A former office director of \nApplicant noted he is very thorough and is attentive to detail. He trusts Applicant and \nhas confidence in his character and judgment. He has seen him mature and grow \nintellectually and considers him a man of integrity.23  \n \n \nA former supervisor testified on behalf of Applicant. He considers Applicant to be \nvery professional, hard working, and trustworthy. Applicant has worked in positions of \ntrust in the past and has always been compliant with security guidelines. Applicant told \nhis supervisor about his 2004 arrest for marijuana possession shortly after it occurred. \nThe supervisor would recommend Applicant for a position of trust. 24 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n21 Id. \n \n22 AE 1-7. \n \n23 Tr. 30-40. \n \n24 Tr. 49-69. \n\n \n8 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 including:  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant has numerous alcohol-related incidents beginning as a minor in 1993. \nHe has three alcohol-related convictions, one a reduced charge to Reckless Driving and \ntwo DUI convictions, in 1998 and 2005. The above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 and \nespecially considered: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \n \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s testimony that since his 2005 DUI conviction that \nhe has reduced his consumption of alcohol. He is now the custodial parent of his son \nand has focused his attention on being a good father. It has been more than three years \nsince his last alcohol-related offense. I am somewhat concerned that Applicant attempts \nto gauge his consumption of alcohol and then attempts to drive. His estimations have \nbeen inaccurate and resulted in his last arrest. However, under the circumstances it \nappears Applicant has changed his lifestyle and with now having the responsibility as a \nfull-time parent, I find enough time has passed and further alcohol-related incidents are \nunlikely to recur. I find AG \u00b6 23 (a) applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which , if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant deliberately failed to divulge his 1998 Reckless Driving conviction on \nhis 2001 and 2003 SCA. I did not find his explanations credible.25 Applicant consistently \nand deliberately failed to divulge important required and requested information. I am \nconcerned that Applicant repeatedly attempted to hide damaging information from the \ngovernment that was required to conduct a background investigation. His testimony was \nnot believable.  \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct related to alcohol beginning in 1993. \nHe was arrested six times for alcohol-related offenses. Two of his alcohol-related \noffenses occurred within two months of each other. He has attended alcohol education. \nHe was on probation for five years after his first DUI conviction and was on probation for \na year after his 2005 DUI conviction. Applicant\u2019s personal conduct and his attempts to \nconceal it are causes of concern. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17. I have especially considered \nthe following: \n \n25 I have not considered Applicant\u2019s other omissions for disqualifying purposes, but did consider \nthem when making a credibility determination and evaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significant contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nApplicant did not make an effort to correct the omissions and falsifications on his \n2001 or 2003 SCA before being confronted. His actions can not be considered minor \nbecause he failed to divulge information that was pertinent to his security clearance \ninvestigation thereby casting doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nApplicant has a history of questionable personal conduct. He has been arrested \nnumerous times and has two DUI convictions and an alcohol-related Reckless Driving \nconviction. He was on probation twice, attended alcohol awareness classes. Applicant \ncontinues to believe that these were isolated incidents. He has demonstrated a pattern \nof misconduct and does not seem to grasp its significance. I do not find sufficient \nevidence has been presented to convince me he has taken action to reduce his \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Based on all of the evidence I find \nnone of the above mitigating conditions apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n12 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has a good work record and is considered a very good employee. His \ncharacter witnesses and references believe he has matured and grown. He actively \npursued obtaining custodial custody of his son who now lives with him. Applicant has a \nhistory of alcohol-related offenses. It appears at this time that he is focusing on being a \ngood father and has minimized his consumption. He has not had an alcohol-related \nincident since his last DUI conviction in 2005. Applicant had two alcohol-related \nincidents in a two-month period in 1998, both DUIs, but one was reduced to Reckless \nDriving. He failed to divulge all of his misconduct as was required. I find these were not \noversights or simple mistakes, but rather were deliberate omissions with intent to \nmislead the government. Applicant has established a pattern of rules violations. I have \nconsidered the totality of the events and circumstances and conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, but \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He visited his family living in Iran in 2003, 2006 and \n2007, and communicates with his mother and/or sisters about twice a month. Security \nconcerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence are not mitigated. \nEligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 31, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 4). \nOn June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him (Item 1), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \nOctober 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign Preference). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 8, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated August 8, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did not provide additional documents within the 30 \ndays. On October 21, 2008, the case was assigned to another administrative judge and \non October 22, 2008, the case was transferred to me.    \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel asked me to take administrative notice concerning materials \nrelated to the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) summarized in the FORM at pages 3-9, as \nwell as the contents of the attachments listed at pages 8-9. The attachments are \nprovided to provide elaboration and context for the facts in pages 3-7. Id. at 1. Applicant \ndid not object to Department Counsel\u2019s request.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.

Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice is granted.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n2Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated August 11, 2008; \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated September 5, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations concerning \nthe security concerns raised in the SOR (Item 4). His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old (Item 4 at 4). He was born in Iran and became a U.S. \ncitizen in 1997 (Item 4 at 1). He received a U.S. passport in 2005 (Item 4 at 1). A \ngovernment contractor has employed him since 1997 as an associate technical fellow \n(Item 4 at 7). He married in 1983 (Item 4 at 8) His spouse was born in Iran and she \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1998 (Item 4 at 8, Item 5 at 3). His spouse has an Iranian \npassport (Item 5 at 3). His children were born in 1987 and 1997 in the United States \n(Item 4 at 9). He received a bachelor of science degree in 1980 and a masters degree \nin computer science in 1985 both from U.S. universities (Item 4 at 6).  \n \nApplicant has never served in the U.S. military (Item 4 at 11). He has not left \nemployment under adverse conditions or been fired in the last seven years (Item 4 at \n12). He has no prior felony convictions, offenses involving firearms or explosives, or \noffenses involving drugs or alcohol (Item 4 at 12). He does not use illegal drugs (Item 4 \nat 12).  He has not had any financial problems such as seriously delinquent debts, \nbankruptcy, garnished wages, property repossessions and unpaid judgments (Item 4 at \n12-13). \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 84-years-old, is a citizen of Iran and lives in Iran (Item 4 at \n8; SOR \u00b6 2.a). He calls his mother about every two weeks and visits her when he goes \nto Iran (Item 5 at 3). His mother-in-law is 80-years-old, is a citizen of Iran and lives in \nIran (Item 4 at 10, Item 5 at 4; SOR \u00b6 2.c). His father and father-in-law are deceased \n(Item 4 at 9-10). His sisters are 55 and 60-years-old and both are Iranian citizens and \nlive in Iran (Item 4 at 9-10, Item 5 at 3; SOR \u00b6 2.b).  One sister works for an agency of \nthe Iranian government (Item 5 at 3, 5). Applicant does not have any property in Iran \n(Item 5 at 3). He maintains regular contact with his sisters using email (Item 5 at 3).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response emphasized his strong connections to the United \nStates and his very limited connections to Iran (Item 4). He owns a home in the United \nStates (Item 5 at 4). He gave up his Iranian inheritance to his family living in Iran (Item 3 \nat 2). He promised that he would resolve any conflict that might develop in favor of the \nUnited States.   \n \n \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. Items 3 (response to SOR) as well as Items 5 and 6 \n(responses to Interrogatories) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise.  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nIranian Passport \n  \n \nAfter becoming a U.S. citizen in 1997, Applicant renewed his Iranian passport in \n2006 (Item 4, Item 5 at 3; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c).  He used his Iranian passport to travel \nto Iran in 2003, 2006 and 2007 (Item 4, Item 5 at 3, 5-6; SOR \u00b6 2.d). He travels to Iran \nto visit his family (primarily his mother) (Item 6 at 14). In 2006, he stayed in Iran for \nthree weeks (Item 5 at 3-4). In 2007, he visited Iran for 2 \u00bd weeks (Item 5 at 6). His \nIranian passport will not expire until 2011 (Item 4; SOR \u00b6 1.b). In his response to an \nApril 2008 DOHA interrogatory, Applicant said he intended to renew his Iranian passport \n(Item 6 at 12).   \n \nIn the FORM, dated August 8, 2008, Department Counsel suggested to Applicant \nthat he could mitigate security concerns about Guideline C, Foreign Preference, for \npossession of a current Iranian passport by destroying it, surrendering it to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidating it. Id. at 11; See Adjudicative \nGuideline (AG) \u00b6\u00b6 11(d). Applicant did not turn-in his Iranian passport to his security \nofficer, destroy it in the presence of his security officer, or otherwise invalidate it.   \n  \nIran4 \n \nIran is a \u201c\u2018constitutional, theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy \ndominate the key power structures\u2019 and \u2018ultimate political authority is vested in a learned \nreligious scholar.\u2019\u201d (FORM at 4) (internal citations omitted). Iran engages in clandestine \nefforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), \nsponsors international terrorism, intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq, undermines \nthe Middle East peace process, and violates the human rights of the Iranian people. The \nUnited States and its allies are attempting to block Iran\u2019s goals of obtaining nuclear \nweapons and other WMD and to counter Iran\u2019s efforts to destabilize Iraq and other \nMiddle East countries.   \n \nIran is one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism. The United States is \nconcerned about the possibility that terrorists could eventually obtain WMD from Iran. \nIran supports terrorists who attack Israel and Shiite militias who have encouraged, \nfacilitated and engaged in sectarian violence in Iraq. \n \nIranian born, naturalized U.S. citizens, should carefully consider the risks of \ntravel in Iran because they are still considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities. \nIran does not recognize dual citizenship. The Iranian government has harassed and \ndetained dual citizens of the United States and Iran.       \n \n \n4 The FORM and its attachments are the sources for the facts in this section. See also \nAdministrative Notice, supra. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n \n5See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines C (Foreign \nPreference) and B (Foreign Influence).  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1) describes one condition that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case, \u201c(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation \nof foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a \nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign \npassport.\u201d Applicant renewed his Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. He \ncontinues to possess an Iranian passport that will continue to be valid until 2011, \nestablishing AG \u00b6 10(a). \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. He did not invalidate or relinquish his \nIranian passport prior to receipt of the FORM. Department Counsel reminded him in the \nFORM that he could mitigate Foreign Preference concerns through AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and \n11(e), however, he did not take action to effectuate these provisions.7    \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \n7 In the decretal paragraph, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.c because it essentially \nreplicates or duplicates the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. SOR \u00b6 1.b is amended to add, \u201cYou became a U.S. \ncitizen in 1997.\u201d      \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s two sisters and mother are citizens and residents of Iran. He visited \nhis family in Iran in 2003, 2006 and 2007. He has contact with his mother every two \nweeks and with his sisters by email. He continues to possess a valid Iranian passport. \nHowever, foreign influence as a security concern is not established with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law (SOR \u00b6 2.c). There is not enough information in the record \nabout Applicant\u2019s contacts with her, or his spouse\u2019s contacts with her.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated, \nsometimes hostile relationship of Iran with the United States places a heavy, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship \nwith his family members living in Iran does not pose a security risk and that he is not in \na position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his family \nmembers living in Iran.8 With its poor human rights record, and political and military \nadversarial relationship with the United States, it is conceivable that Iran would target \nany Iranian citizen or former citizen living in the United States in an attempt to gather \nvaluable information from the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his family living in Iran create a potential conflict of \ninterest because this relationship is sufficiently close to raise a possible security \nconcern about his desire to help his family living in Iran and Iranian authorities\u2019 potential \nattempt to pressure or coerce him through his family living in Iran to provide classified \ninformation.    \n \n8An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in most other countries. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security \nconcerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. \n4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); \nISCR Case No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (stating \u201cBetween January 9, 2007 and January 18, \n2008, the Appeal Board decided 36 appeals involving Iran under the old guidelines, and it reversed 20 \ndecisions granting clearances and affirmed 15 decisions denying clearances\u201d and listing at 9 n.1 the \npertinent cases). The Appeal Board\u2019s trend of denying clearances for Applicants with Iranian connections \nhas continued into October 2008. See ISCR Case No. 07-13209 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2008) (holding Iranian \nclearance denial affirmed); ISCR Case No. 07-07928 (App. Bd. Oct. 1, 2008) (same); ISCR Case No. 07-\n07635 (App. Bd. Aug. 22, 2008) (same); ISCR Case No. 07-06030 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008) (reversing \ngrant of clearance to U.S. citizen from Iran). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nfamily living in Iran, his relationship with them, and his travel to Iran in 2003, 2006 and \n2007 to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith his family members living in Iran because he has an emotional bond with them. He \ncommunicates with them regularly and frequently. His relationship with them requires a \ncloser examination because of those contacts and his evident care and concern for \nthem, especially his mother. Although Applicant\u2019s close relationship with them is an \nimportant positive reflection on his character, the same close relationship raises security \nconcerns for possible foreign influence.     \n \nThere is no evidence that his family members living in Iran have been a political \nactivist, challenging the policies of the Iranian Government. There is no evidence his \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nsister\u2019s work for the Iranian Government is substantial enough to aggravate the security \nconcern. There is no evidence that terrorists or the Iranian Government have \napproached or threatened Applicant or his family in Iran because of his work in the \nUnited States. There is no evidence that his family living in Iran currently engages in \nactivities which would bring significant attention to them or that they or other Iranian \nelements are even aware that Applicant works for a government contractor or might \nhave access to classified information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that these \nrelatives would be targets for coercion or exploitation. But see n. 8, infra (discussing \nlimited weight that can be given to the absence of such information). \n \nApplicant deserves some credit because of the reduced possibility that Iran will \nexploit his family living in Iran because of the low profile they have in Iranian society. \nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his mother and other Iranian family members, his \nfrequent contacts with them, and the nature of the Iranian Government and its \ncomplicated, and contentious relationship to the United States, all weigh against \nmitigating security concerns. See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, \n2007) (finding contacts with siblings in PRC \u201conce every two or three  months\u201d not to be \ncasual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per year \nnot casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent).9     \n \n \n9In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 1, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005))  and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with his wife and children and his strong \nconnections to the United States tend to mitigate foreign interest security concerns. \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d His wife \nand children are U.S. citizens, and reside in the United States. Applicant has lived in the \nUnited States for most of his life. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant, his \nspouse and his children are fully inculcated with U.S. values. All of his property and \ninvestments are in the United States, and he has no property or investments in Iran. He \nhas many friends and colleagues in the United States. He is a loyal, dedicated and \ntrustworthy U.S. citizen.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant stated that he did not have a preference for any country over the \nUnited States (Item 3 at 1). He promised to be loyal to the United States (Item 3 at 1). \nHe said he loved the United States and would never do anything to harm the United \nStates (Item 3 at 1). I found these statements and promises to be sincere and credible. \nHowever, in ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007), the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a PRC Applicant\u2019s clearance \nbecause he gave too much weight to the Applicant\u2019s \u201cstrong ties to the U.S.\u201d and \ndetermined there was insufficient evidentiary support for the conclusion that he \u201ccan be \ntrusted to resolve any conflict of interest . . . in favor of the U.S.\u201d The Applicant in ISCR \nCase No. 06-24575 said he would not act against the U.S. if faced with the choice. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nHowever, the Appeal Board gives such promises little weight in their review of the \nevidence,10 stating: \n \nAn Applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what he would do in the future is of \nrelatively little weight, given the record in this case. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09053 at (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s stated intention \nabout what he or she might do in the future under some hypothetical set of \ncircumstances is merely a statement of intention that is not entitled to \nmuch weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted \nin a similar manner in the past under similar circumstances.\u201d) \n \nId. at 4. See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) (criticizing the \nadministrative judge\u2019s reliance on PRC-Applicant\u2019s promise to choose the U.S. over \nPRC should a conflict arise, and reversing the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a \n \n \n10 The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are met: \n \nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such relevant \nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light \nof all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board \nshall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge; \n \nE3.1.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865 \n(enclosure 1) and this Directive; or \n \nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. \n \nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination,\u201d recognizing they have no \nopportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United \nStates v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \"de novo determination\": \n \n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent \ndetermination of a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the \nsame controversy. Thus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, \n23 [(1974)], the Court had occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \n\"unfettered by any prejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim \nthat the [agency's] determination is supported by substantial evidence.\" And, in United \nStates v. First City National Bank, 386 U.S. 361, 368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \n\"review de novo\" means \"that the court should make an independent determination of the \nissues\" and should \"not . . .  give any special weight to the [prior] determination of\" the \nadministrative agency.  \n \n(internal footnotes omitted). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2007), the Appeal Board \ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, \nand then decided the case itself. Judge White\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility \ndeterminations and ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the \njudge who makes witness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-\n11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006) (Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to \nreverse hearing-level judicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial \nerror). \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nclearance). I respect the Appeal Board\u2019s position and give little weight to Applicant\u2019s \npromises. \n    \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iran must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Iran, as well as the dangers existing in Iran.11 Iran\u2019s relationship \nwith the United States has significantly changed over the decades and is likely to \nchange again in the future. Iran was an important U.S. ally after World War II until \nremoval of the Shah, but is now in an adversarial relationship with the United States. \nIran currently has a poor human rights record. Iran seeks weapons of mass destruction, \nand supports terrorism.  \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant has lived in the United States for most of his life. He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1997. His wife and children are U.S. citizens and residents of \nthe United States. His property and assets are in the United States and he has no \nassets in Iran. Applicant is a law-abiding U.S. citizen, and there is no evidence of any \nperformance or work-related problems. He compellingly described his loyalty to the \nUnited States, rather than to Iran. I found his statements to be honest, candid and \ncredible.    \n \nOne element increasing the foreign influence security concern is Applicant\u2019s \nfrequent contacts with his family in Iran, and his visits to Iran to see them. He frequently \ncommunicates with his mother and sisters. Applicant clearly has a close relationship \nwith his elderly mother living in Iran. She is vulnerable to Iranian coercion and non-\ncoercive measures because of her Iranian citizenship and where she lives. His sister, \nwho is employed by an agency of the Iranian government is vulnerable to pressure and \nindirectly such pressure could be applied to Applicant by the Iranian government \nthreatening to stop or stopping her pay. Because Iranian government and intelligence \npersonnel may violate Iranian or international law, they are more likely to use improper \nand/or illegal means to obtain classified information through his family living in Iran.  \nAdditionally, Applicant has retained a currently valid Iranian passport, and visited Iran in \n2003, 2006 and 2007. \n \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of his connections to Iran and to the United \nStates, I conclude Applicant has failed to carry his burden of mitigating the foreign \ninfluence and foreign preference security concerns.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.    \n \n11 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n12See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

She lives with her mother, who is retired, and her 16-year-old daughter. Applicant is solely responsible for the support of her daughter. (Ex. 1; Tr. 37, 46-50.) Applicant is employed by a government contractor as a network data engineer. She has worked for her current employer for approximately four years, and she has worked in the network computer field for approximately 15 years. She seeks a security clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 37-40.) Applicant was unemployed from January 1996 to April 1999, and during that period she attended college. She accrued student loan debt, which at the present time totals about $16,000.

Her eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on March 3, 2006. On May 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nSeptember 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 1, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 1, 2009. \nApplicant, Department Counsel, and I agreed to a hearing date of August 10, 2009. A \nNotice of Hearing was issued, and Applicant reported for her hearing as scheduled. \nHowever, I was unable to convene the hearing at the appointed time because I was \nconducting another hearing that ran overtime. Applicant was unable to take part in a \nlater hearing on that day because she had a travel assignment. We went on the record \nand identified an alternative time for the hearing. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s hearing was \ncontinued and rescheduled for August 17, 2009, and, on that date, I convened a hearing \nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance for Applicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified \non her own behalf and called no witnesses. She introduced five exhibits, which were \nmarked as Ex. A through Ex. E. Applicant\u2019s exhibits consisted of letters of character \nreference. Only one of the five letters of character reference, Ex. E, was signed and \ndated. I left the record open until close of business, August 31, 2009, so that Applicant \ncould, if she wished, submit signed and dated copies of the letters of character \nreference conditionally marked as Ex. A through Ex. D. Applicant timely filed signed  \ncopies of the letters identified as Ex. A and Ex. B. She timely submitted two additional \nletters of character reference, which I marked as Ex. F and Ex. G. Ex. F was signed but \nnot dated. Ex. G was neither signed nor dated. Applicant\u2019s seven letters of character \nreference were admitted to the record without objection for whatever probative value \nthey might have. \n \n DOHA received two transcripts (Tr.) related to this hearing. The first transcript, \nreceived August 13, 2009, identified the hearing scheduled for August 10, 2009, \nmemorialized the continuance, and identified the date and time of the rescheduled \nhearing. The second transcript, received August 21, 2009, was made from the recording \nof the rescheduled hearing conducted on August 17, 2009.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 18 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.r.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthe 14 allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n. She denied four allegations at \u00b6\u00b6 1.o. through \n1.r. The government conceded that the SOR allegation \u00b6 1.o. duplicated SOR allegation \n\u00b6 1.n. and that the alleged debt could not be further identified with specificity. The \ngovernment also conceded that it was unable to identify the medical debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.p. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as findings of fact. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and separated from her husband. She lives with her \nmother, who is retired, and her 16-year-old daughter. Applicant is solely responsible for \nthe support of her daughter. (Ex. 1; Tr. 37, 46-50.) \n \n \nApplicant is employed by a government contractor as a network data engineer. \nShe has worked for her current employer for approximately four years, and she has \nworked in the network computer field for approximately 15 years. She seeks a security \nclearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 37-40.) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from January 1996 to April 1999, and during that \nperiod she attended college. She accrued student loan debt, which at the present time \ntotals about $16,000. The loans were in delinquent status in the past, but Applicant has \nrehabilitated the loans and now pays $185 per month to reduce her student loan debt. \nThe loans are in current status. Applicant was also unemployed between May 2001 and \nFebruary 2004. During this second period of unemployment, her husband supported her \nand she drew money from her savings. (Ex. 1; Ex. 3 at 10; 42-43, 69-70.)  \n \n \nDuring her periods of unemployment, Applicant began to fall behind in paying her \ndebts, and she continues to have financial difficulties. She admits she owes \napproximately $110,000 in delinquent debt, including two tax liens to the Internal \nRevenue Service. The two tax liens together total approximately $88,000, and they date \nto 2001. The tax liens remain unsatisfied. Applicant has been in contact with the Internal \nRevenue Service, but she has not yet worked out a payment plan or made an offer in \ncompromise. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k. and 1.l.; Ex. 5; Ex, 6; Tr. 62-66.) \n \n \nApplicant owes a judgment creditor a debt of approximately $13,871 for an \nautomobile she purchased in 1993. The automobile was repossessed in 1996. Applicant \nlast contacted the creditor in 2007. The judgment has not been satisfied. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.; \nEx. 5; Ex. 6; Tr. 66-69.)    \n \n  \n \nIn addition to the judgment and the two tax liens, Applicant admitted \nresponsibility for ten debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.i, 1.j., and 1.m. These \ndelinquent debts totaled $6,708. She denied the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q. and 1.r. \nShe disputed the amount of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.q. and claimed she owed a \nlesser amount. However, she failed to provide documentation to corroborate her \nassertion. She also asserted that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.r. had been settled; her \ncredit report of April 14, 2009, corroborated that the debt had been settled. (Ex. 6 at 2; \nTr. 52-62.) \n \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant enrolled in a debt consolidation program. She agreed to \npay the debt consolidation company $129 a month for 28 months to assist her in \ncontacting her creditors and resolving her delinquent debt. At her hearing, she \nexpressed dissatisfaction with the services provided by the debt consolidation company. \nShe estimated that the company had paid off about 30% of the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b. through 1.l. Applicant agreed to provide a statement from the debt consolidation \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \ncompany showing how much of her delinquent debt had been satisfied through its \nefforts. However, she failed to provide this information. (Ex. 4; Tr. 55-60, 93.) \n \n \nApplicant is a contract employee. Her federal and state income taxes are not \ndeducted from her pay by her employer, and she is responsible for paying those taxes \ndirectly to the taxing authorities. (Tr. 72- 73, 87-89.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income, before she pays her taxes, is $6,000. After \nApplicant pays her taxes, she has a net income each month of approximately $4,000. \nShe pays her own health insurance. Her monthly rent payment is $1,6651 and her \nmonthly payment on the automobile she purchased in May 2006 is $498. After paying \nher other fixed monthly expenses, Applicant has a net remainder of approximately $300 \nto $400. In determining her net monthly remainder, she did not include her payment to \nthe debt consolidation program. She does not have a savings account. She reported the \nbalance in her checking account as $58.46. (Tr. 75-82.) \n \n \nApplicant reported that she had not yet paid her federal income taxes for tax year \n2008. She reported that she had requested and received from the Internal Revenue \nService an extension until October 2009 to pay her 2008 income taxes. Applicant has \nnot enrolled in consumer credit counseling. She is reluctant to consider bankruptcy \nbecause she feels she is responsible for paying her debts. (Tr. 33, 70, 82-83.)   \n \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s supervisors and co-workers provided letters of character \nreference on her behalf. They praised Applicant\u2019s professionalism, technical skills, and \ndedication to mission. One of her supervisors had this to say about Applicant: \n\u201c[Applicant] distinguished herself by her consistent hard work . . . and her ability to adapt \nto task changes at a moment\u2019s notice. [Applicant] is an intelligent, capable [and] \ndedicated . . . person.\u201d (Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. E; Ex. F.)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \n1 Applicant stated that she planned to reduce her monthly expenses by moving to a less expensive \napartment. (Tr. 31, 33-34.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns.  Additionally, under AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s \nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash \nflow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d may raise security \nconcerns. \n \nApplicant is financially overextended, has accumulated substantial delinquent \ndebt, and was unable to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. If the \nfinancially delinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might \napply.  If \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies began several years \nago and continue to this day. Applicant\u2019s current financial delinquencies involve \nsubstantial sums of money in proportion to her income and resources, occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur, and cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nThe record does not include facts that suggest protracted conditions beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control that would explain her failure over a period of years to meet her \nfinancial obligations. While she experienced unemployment in the past, she has been \nsteadily employed with her current employer for the past four years. To her credit, \nApplicant sought to consolidate her debts, and she is current in paying her student loan \nobligations. She has contacted the Internal Revenue Service to negotiate a payment \nplan for her $88,000 tax liens dating to 2001. However, all but one of her debts remain \nunresolved. She has not enrolled in consumer credit counseling, and she does not have \na plan in place to avoid financial overextension in the future. While Applicant\u2019s intention \nto satisfy her creditors in the future is laudable, she has failed to demonstrate a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. She has not yet demonstrated that she will repay her \ncreditors and avoid financial delinquencies in the future. I conclude that none of the \nfinancial considerations mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s supervisors and \nco-workers respect and appreciate her professionalism and strong technical skills. She \nworks hard and is a reliable employee. She has been steadily employed with her current \nemployer for four years.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies date to the late 1990s and early \n2000s, and she has addressed them only recently. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nwhen she was a mature adult, and she failed to address her delinquent debts for a \nsignificant period of time, a decision that raises concerns about her judgment and \nreliability. Applicant is responsible for approximately $110,000 in delinquent debt. She \nhas failed to demonstrate that she understands her financial problems, and she has not \ndeveloped a plan to satisfy her creditors.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n           Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n. through 1.p.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On August 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on September 16, 2008, and she requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on October 16, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 30, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for December 11, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented two exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 and 2.  The Applicant\npresented six exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F, and testified on\nher own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on December 23, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\n\n2\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Taiwan.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 16).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 45 years of age and has a Masters Degree\nin Computer Science.  She is employed as a NT Administrator for a defense contractor.\nShe seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nindustry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 1963.  She moved to the United\nStates in 1988 to pursue higher education.  After obtaining her Masters Degree and\nlearning that she loved the American culture, she decided to make the United States her\npermanent home.  In 1995, she married a United States citizen.  They have two children\nwho are native born American citizens.  She established friends, neighbors, and assets\nin the United States.  In 2000, she became a United States citizen and obtained a\nUnited States passport.  On June 24, 2008, she physically destroyed her Taiwanese\npassport in front of her Facility Security Officer.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  She does not\nconsider herself a dual citizen, only a citizen of the United States.  She attends church\nand volunteers in her community by visiting the elderly in convalescent homes and\nhelping the homeless.  She and her husband are currently going through a divorce.\n(Government Exhibit 2). \n       \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother and father were born in and are citizens and residents of\nTaiwan.  Her mother is and always has been a homemaker.  Her father is a retired\nbusinessman who was in the import/export business.  Other than her father\u2019s two year\nmandatory military service, he has had no other associations with the Government of\nTaiwan.  The Applicant communicates with her parents in Taiwan about twice a month\nor so.  The Applicant\u2019s parents are financially self-sufficient and the Applicant provides\nthem with no financial support.  Her parents own a house in Taiwan that upon their\ndeath will be inherited by the Applicant\u2019s brother.\n         \nThe Applicant\u2019s brother, who is 43 years old and self-employed as an interior\ndesigner, is a dual citizen of Taiwan and Canada.  He currently resides in Taiwan.  The\nApplicant\u2019s only contact with him is about three times a year.  He is not affiliated with the\nTaiwanese Government in any capacity.    \n\n3\nIn November 1999, November 2003 and March 2004, the Applicant traveled to\nTaiwan for a vacation and to visit her parents.  On two of those occasions, she took her\nchildren with her to allow them the opportunity to visit their grandparents.  During her\nvisit in March 2004, the Applicant\u2019s parents asked her if she wanted to vote and so she\ndid.  During these visits the Applicant has never been approached by anyone seeking\nprotected or sensitive information from her.  In the event that she is ever confronted with\nthis situation, she testified that she will report it to her company\u2019s security department.    \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother purchased two properties in Taiwan and placed them in\nthe Applicant\u2019s name when she was a child.  One of the properties was an apartment,\nthe other was a resort room in a resort hotel.  Applicant explained that she has never\nseen the properties and this was done simply to avoid taxes in Taiwan.  Applicant has\nsince transferred these properties back into her mother\u2019s name, since she is the true\nowner.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nThe Applicant has no assets in Taiwan.  Applicant\u2019s financial records indicate that\nshe owns a house In the United States worth approximately $870,000.00, with\napproximately $670,000.00 in equity, several IRA\u2019s, with almost $100,00.00, and a\nchecking and savings account with approximately $28,000.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\nApplicant has received numerous certificates for her contributions to the work\nenvironment, including Excellence in Action awards with monetary compensation, and\nfor courses she has successfully completed.  A Performance Review of the Applicant\ndated August 26, 2008 reflects \u201cexceptional performance\u201d in the implementation and\nsuccessful execution of a system upgrade.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Direct Manager, her fourth level\nManager, a coworker, and a friend, attest to her competency, conscientiousness,\nprofessionalism and hard working attitude.  She is considered to be responsible, mature\nand trustworthy.  She consistently exhibits good judgment, is well organized, extremely\nefficient and willing to do whatever task is needed to get the job done.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit D). \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Taiwan.  Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one of the most\nactive collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.  Numerous\nindividuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and or prosecuted for\nillegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United States technology to\nTaiwan.  One United States official was recently convicted of crimes relating to his\nimproper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\n\n4\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n\n5\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence and has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S, and 8(c) Contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s parents and brother are residents and citizens of\nTaiwan, the Applicant has limited contact with them.  There is no evidence of a close\nbond or strong evidence of affection.  She may speak with her parents twice a month\nbut the conversation is casual.  She only communicates with her brother three times a\nyear.  Clearly, the Applicant\u2019s deep and abiding ties are here in the United States.  She\nhas lived in the United States for the past twenty years.  Although she is going currently\ngoing through a divorce, she has two young children that she is responsible for.  She\nhas worked hard to establish herself as a responsible, educated, productive United\nStates citizen.  Her employment with the DOD and her significant assets, that include\nher home, a checking and saving account and retirement account, are all in the United\nStates.  The Applicant essentially cut all ties from Taiwan when she moved to the\nUnited States in 1988, and made it her permanent home.  \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Taiwan elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond and\naffection with her foreign family members or to any foreign individual or to Taiwan in any\nway that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, there is no possibility of\nforeign influence that exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn October 9, 2004, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On May 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 19, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 19, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on May 21, 2008. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on June 10, 2008, and I received the case assignment on August \n27, 2008.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 20, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on November 7, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 15, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthrough 8, which were received without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nExhibit A, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nNovember 21, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). (Tr. at 13-15.) The \nrequest and the attached documents were admitted into evidence and were included in \nthe record as Hearing Exhibits 3 to 8.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in \nthe Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b61.b, to 1.j of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor in the \ncomputer industry.  He came to the United States in 1987, and became a United States \ncitizen in July 1999.  His wife was born in the PRC, married Applicant in the PRC in \n1986, and became a United States citizen in 2006.  Applicant came to the United States \nin January 1987 to pursue a doctorate program in electronic engineering.  He withdrew \nfrom the program in 1988 because his English was poor and he could not afford to pay \nthe tuition for the program.  He received his undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees in the \nPRC in 1983 and 1987, respectively.  Between 1998 and 2007, Applicant took pleasure \nand business trips to Japan (six times), and to the PRC (eight times).  He worked for an \nelectronics company when he took the business trips.  He traveled to the PRC to visit \nhis mother on any pleasure trip there. His last trip there in 2007 was for two weeks.  \nAfter he became a U.S. citizen, Applicant used his U.S. passport for these trips.  He \nkeeps his expired PRC passport as a souvenir.  He cut the corner of the passport to \nshow it is no longer effective. He wants a security clearance to increase his job security.  \nHe had an interim security clearance for about three years, with no violations, until the \nissuance of the SOR terminated it. (Tr. 19-26, 29, 30, 33, 34, 39, 52, 71, 81; Exhibits 1, \n2 and A) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother was the Director of the China Central Television station in \nBeijing, PRC.  She worked there from 1985 to 1991 when she retired.  Later, she was \nthe manager of the Central Television Tower in Beijing from 1994 to 1998, when she \nretired again.  She is a member of the PRC Communist Party.  She is 77 years old.  His \nmother helped him obtain his first engineer\u2019s job in the United States in 1992 because \nshe knew someone at the computer company.  Applicant worked there for 12 years \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbefore being laid off in 2004.  He telephones his mother weekly.  His mother knows he \napplied for a security clearance.  Applicant told the Government investigator that his \nmother and father were on an FBI data base file. (Tr. 31, 39-41, 45, 58, 83; Exhibits 1 \nand 2) \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s father is deceased, having died in 2003.  When alive, he was \nemployed by the Chinese Academy Lab, specializing in sonar development.  He retired \nas the Director of the Lab, overseeing about 2000 staff members.  The PRC Navy used \nhis lab for research and development of sonar equipment.  He was a member of the \nPRC Communist Party.  Applicant traveled to the PRC in 2003 for his father\u2019s funeral. \n(Tr. 42, 43, 45, 58, 71; Exhibits 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a Senior Colonel in the PRC People\u2019s Liberation Army \n(PLA).  He joined it in 1975 and remains an officer in the PLA.  He is involved in the \ninternational inspection of chemical warfare production and land mine issues.  Since \n1987, Applicant has seen his brother three times in the United States when he traveled \nhere for conferences.  Applicant visited him on his trips to the PRC. He emails his \nbrother every couple of months.  He telephones him annually. His brother knows he has \napplied for a security clearance.  His brother\u2019s wife lives in the PRC. (Tr. 44-49, 70, 83; \nExhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of and resident of the PRC.  His wife calls \nher twice a year.  She is 87 years old and lives in Beijing.   Her husband died in 1996.  \nHe was a roadway engineer.  Applicant sends his mother-in-law about $1,000 annually, \nand has for the past 10 years to support her. (Tr. 34-37; Exhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s half-brother-in-law and half-sister-in-law are citizens of the PRC, and \nlive there.  They worked for the PRC national railway system.  Applicant\u2019s wife has little \ncontact with her siblings because they have a different mother and she had little contact \nwith them growing up. (Tr. 49-51; Exhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nApplicant has two aunts and one uncle who are citizens of the PRC, and live \nthere.  He also has five adult cousins who are citizens of the PRC and live in the PRC. \n(Tr. 49-51; Exhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nApplicant was a member of the Communist Youth League from 1977 to 1986.  \nApplicant joined voluntarily, wanting to be a good Communist and a model PRC citizen.  \nHe joined at age 15 (in 1976) and remained a member through college until 1987 when \nhe became 26 years old, the maximum age for this youth league. It was the same year \nhe graduated with a master\u2019s degree and came to the United States.  Applicant believed \nin the communist doctrines and programs when young, but as he grew older came to \nrealize that the PRC government was not a perfect example of communism.  After \ncollege he began to question the entire idea of communism.  He claims he is not a \ncommunist today. (Tr. 27, 58-70; Exhibits 1 and 2) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant owns his own home in the United States.  He has no property in the \nPRC or outside the United States.  He has bank accounts in the United States and \nowns mutual funds for his investment portfolio. (Tr. 56, 57) \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning the PRC.  The PRC \nis a one-party Communist totalitarian state.  It has an economy growing at 10% \nannually, and expanding military forces, including its naval forces.  It engages in \nindustrial and military espionage on a regular basis against the United States and other \ncountries.  The United States and the PRC have been rivals since 1948, when the \nCommunists took control of mainland China, and the Nationalist government fled to the \nisland of Taiwan.  Taiwan remains an issue of contention between the two countries.  \nThe U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission=s 2006 report to the U.S. \nCongress found the PRC has a large and aggressive intelligence gathering operation in \nthe United States, particularly in the scientific and military fields.  The PRC engages \nregularly in military, economic, and industrial espionage, including stealing nuclear \nweapons technology, missile design information, and commercial technology. The PRC \nalso obtains commercial information through the use of front companies, buying dual-\nuse technologies, and the direct collection of technology by non-intelligence agencies \nand individuals. The PLA is integrated into the civil industrial base in the PRC, known as \nthe \u201cdigital triangle.\u201d  The 2007 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and \nSecurity Review Commission (Exhibit 5 at page 102) states the linkages between the \nmilitary and Chinese commercial information technology companies and the R&D \ninstitute are longstanding, \u201cas telecommunications and information technology in China \nwere originally under military auspices and the commercial relationships with state and \nmilitary research institutes remain important.\u201d  Additionally, the U.S. State Department \nreported the PRC has a poor human rights record, including but not limited to, denial of \nfree speech and press, fair and open trials, and other basic rights recognized by the \ninternational community.  It also suppresses political dissent, using arbitrary arrests, \nforced confessions, and mistreatment of prisoners as part of its operational methods to \nmaintain control of its population. (Exhibits 3 to 8) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, aunts and uncles, wife\u2019s relatives, and his cousins \nare citizens and residents of the PRC. His mother was involved in the television industry \nand the Communist Party controlled news organization at a high level of management.  \nShe is a member of the Chinese Communist Party.  His brother is a senior colonel in the \nPRC PLA, and is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. He pays his mother-in-\nlaw $1,000 annually in support payments, and has for a decade.  He contacts his \nmother weekly and his brother several times a year by various several communications \nmethods.  His mother and brother are or were involved in the organizations in the PRC \nwhich are closely controlled by the Communist Party and its government, according to \nthe 2007 Report to the Congress cited in the administrative notice. His parents were on \nan FBI database list at some point in time, according to Applicant, indicating they were \nof some concern to the FBI. This situation creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential \nconflict of interest. AG \u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Two conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \nApplicant did not establish the application of AG \u00b6 8(b) and 8(c).  Based on his \nrelationship with his mother and brother, which is not casual or infrequent, and the \nnature of their work experience, membership in the PRC Communist Party, Applicant \nshowed insufficient evidence and persuasive presentation that his loyalty to the U.S. is \nparamount over his close connections to his mother and brother. Instead, there is a risk \nof exploitation or influence because of these familial connections. Therefore, he cannot \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests, especially \nsince he appears to maintain a strong sense of loyalty and obligation to his mother \nabove all other interests except his own. He came to the United States for his own \npurposes, education and to make money, and not out of a sense of love or commitment \nto the United States and its democratic form of government and individual liberties.  He \nwants a security clearance to increase his job security.  He did not flee the PRC to \nescape persecution, but was a member of a family which were members of the ruling \nCommunist Party, and had high-level positions in the communications and military \nestablishments.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Five circumstances weigh heavily \nagainst Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First, he has close contacts with his \nmother, a confirmed member of the Communist party. Second, he maintains contact \nwith his brother, the PLA Senior Colonel who is a committed Communist. Third, he was \na member of the PRC Communist Party, or its Youth League, until age 26, when he \nclaims he turned away from communist beliefs and toward a desire for economic and \npolitical freedom.  He continued to assert his loyalty to that party into adulthood. His \ndiscussion of his progressive movement away from a Communist philosophy to a \ncapitalist perspective was not persuasive, especially when he espoused the idea that \nthe Communist ideal is good, but the execution of it in China was imperfect.  In his case, \nhe seemed more motivated by personal interests than any commitment to the United \nStates and its democratic ideals.  He was interested in earning more money and getting \nmore education than he could in the PRC, so he came to the United States. His \npersonal selfish needs predominated.  He wants a security clearance to increase his job \nsecurity in private industry. Fourth, throughout the hearing, I did not hear him express a \nstronger sense of dedication or gratitude to the United States, than to a desire for his \npersonal economic success and an underlying loyalty to his two family members and his \nwife.  Here, Applicant\u2019s close connections to his family in the PRC and his personal \nmotivations for a security clearance, as a tool to guarantee his job security in the future, \nare countervailing persuasive issues which weigh against Applicant.  Fifth, he maintains \nsome contact with his mother-in-law and sends her $1,000 annually in support money. \nIn his favor, Applicant held an interim security clearance without any indication \nthat he breached security policies or procedures.   He held that clearance for about \nthree years.  It does not counterbalance the security concerns stated in the previous \nparagraph.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from foreign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b. to 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On April 10, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 31, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative\n\n2\nJudge Rita C. O\u2019Brien denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are erroneous and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant was discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002.\nSubsequently, Applicant acquired significant delinquent debts for such things as consumer\npurchases, credit cards, utility bills, child care, and medical expenses.  Applicant was treated for\ncancer in 2006.  Her child also had medical problems beginning at birth, with treatment lasting until\n2002.  Applicant was not able to pay the medical bills for that treatment.\nApplicant has been arrested twice on charges of credit card fraud.  On one occasion, the\ncharge was dismissed.  On the other, Applicant entered into a plea agreement, with the result that\nthe felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.  \nThe Judge acknowledged that Applicant had experienced both medical problems and\nunemployment, which contributed to her financial difficulties.  However, she also stated that\n\u201cApplicant has not contacted creditors, reported perceived duplicate debts to credit reporting\nagencies, or established a plan to resolve her many remaining debts.\u201d  Decision at 9.  Accordingly,\nthe Judge concluded that Applicant had not acted responsibly with regard to her debts.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings concerning her plea agreement contain errors.\nSpecifically, she challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she pled guilty to credit card fraud pursuant to\nthe plea agreement.  She states that she never admitted that she was guilty and entered her plea of\n\u201cno contest\u201d only to avoid the hazards of trial.  However, the Judge\u2019s finding is supported by\nGovernment Exhibit 8, State Case Information, which characterizes Applicant\u2019s plea as one of\n\u201cguilty.\u201d  Even if the Judge\u2019s finding were in error, it would be harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 01-\n23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No.\n01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s statement that her discharge\nin bankruptcy provided her with a \u201cclean slate.\u201d  The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s comment is\na reasonable characterization of the legal consequences of bankruptcy.  Applicant also disagrees with\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that she does not have a plan to pay off her debts.  However, the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion, viewed in light of the record as a whole, is sustainable.  Applicant has not identified any\nharmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole,\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025\nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not give appropriate weight to evidence favorable to\nher, for example her good work performance.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the\nevidence unless the record demonstrates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App.\nBd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\n\n3\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).

Accordingly, her request for a position of public trust is denied. \n \n \nApplicant signed and submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) on \nAugust 3, 2006. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, \nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \n  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nAugust 31, 2009\n\n \nOn April 10, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nspecifying that its decision was based on concerns addressed in the Directive under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 In \nher Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on April 30, 2009, Applicant admitted all \nSOR allegations except the following: 1.d., 1.e., 1.i., 1.l., 1.p., 1.q., 1.aa., 1.ff., 1.gg., and \n1.ii. She also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 28, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 5, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 25, 2009. During the hearing, \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified and did not present witnesses. She also offered one exhibit, which was marked \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. I held the record open to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted two \ndocuments, which Department Counsel forwarded without objection. I admitted them as \nAE B and C. DOHA received the transcript on July 6, 2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to \nthe evidence by deleting two allegations. The following allegations are struck from the \nSOR: \n \n1.i. \nduplicate of 1.f. \n \n1.i.i. \nThis debt was included in Applicant's 2002 discharged bankruptcy. \n \nThe remaining allegations retain their original numbering. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement \nof Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 41 years old, married in 2005, and separated the same year.

The three youngest \n                                            \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications of trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n2\n\n \nchildren live with her, and she receives no child support. Applicant is currently working \npart-time toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration, specializing in \ninformation technology. She has been employed by a defense contractor since August \n2006. She began as an administrative assistant, and after two promotions, she currently \nholds the position of operations and support analyst. (GE 1; Tr. 18-22). \n \nApplicant has had medical issues over the past several years. In 1988, her first \nchild was born with a birth defect. He had surgeries and frequent hospital stays until his \ntreatment ended in 2002. She was unable to pay the resulting medical bills. During her \nlast pregnancy in 2001, she was unemployed for approximately five months because \nshe was required to be on bed rest. Applicant received some funds from the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, as well as short-term disability \npayments that began approximately four months after she started bed rest and covered \nthe last two months of her confinement. The income was insufficient and she relied on \ncredit cards and help from friends to pay her expenses. In June 2002, Applicant filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition, with liabilities of approximately $120,000. The bankruptcy \nwas discharged in October of the same year. In March 2006,3 Applicant was diagnosed \nwith cancer, and underwent surgery in July 2006. Between March and June, she \nworked part-time, 10 to 15 hours per week. She did not receive unemployment \ncompensation or disability payments during this period (GE 2; Tr. 22-25, 63). \n \nThe SOR alleges approximately $30,000 in delinquent debt. Applicant denies the \nfollowing allegations: \n \n1.d. - $11,511 \u2013 voluntary repossession. Applicant appeared in court about one \nyear ago and reached an agreement with the creditor to pay $150 per month. She \nprovided a document showing a November 2008 payment. She estimates the current \nbalance is approximately $8,550 (GE 2; Tr. 26-27). \n \n1.e. - $1,540 \u2013 unemployment compensation. Applicant applied for and received \ncompensation after she was fired. Her employer informed the state unemployment \ncommission that she left the job. The compensation was found to be unwarranted. She \nstates that she has been making payments of $50 per month, and estimates the current \nbalance is approximately $900. She did not provide supporting documentation (GE 3, 4; \nTr. 27-29). \n \n1.i. \u2013 Deleted by the government. \n \n                                            \n3 Applicant was initially confused and testified that her diagnosis occurred in 2005; she later corrected \nthe date to 2006. \n \n3\n\n \n1.l. - $440 owed to a collection agency \u2013 Applicant cannot find the company that \ncurrently holds the debt, or the original creditor. She has not received any \ncorrespondence concerning this debt (GE 6; Tr. 34-35). \n \n1.p. - $204 owed to a collection agency \u2013 Applicant testified that she has made \npayments on the debt, the last payment being about one year ago, and that she now \nowes $40. She did not provide supporting documentation (GE 6; Tr. 37-38). \n \n1.q. - $203 owed to a retail store \u2013 Applicant stated that she paid this bill in full \ntwo years ago. She contacted the store to have it removed from her credit bureau report \nand was told it would be. She filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency \napproximately 1 \u00bd  years ago. She did not provide supporting documentation (GE 2, 4; \nTr. 39-40).  \n \n1.aa. - $2,085. Applicant testified that this debt was originally owed to a bank for \nan overdraft on her checking account and that it is a duplicate of the debt alleged in 1.z., \nwhich lists the same original creditor and collection agency. When Applicant reviewed \nher records, however, she discovered that allegations 1.aa. and 1.z. relate, instead, to \nstudent loans, and she believes that they are duplicates of the debts alleged at 1.ff. and \n1.gg. Applicant provided evidence to support her claim that she paid the two student \nloans, 1.ff. and 1.gg., in March 2009 (AE B; Tr. 45-47; 50). \n \n1.ii. \u2013 Deleted by the government. \n \nAmong the debts Applicant admits are several that she states she has paid or \nare duplicates of other allegations: \n \n1.g. - $439. Applicant believes that this unpaid debt is a duplicate of the $158 \ndebt alleged at 1.y., which is owed to the same creditor. She has not contacted any of \nthe listed creditors to determine if they are duplicates (Tr. 44-45). \n \n1.n. - $350, owed to a payday loan company. Applicant testified that she paid this \ndebt around December 2008. Applicant provided no documentation to support her claim  \n(Tr. 36). \n \n1.w. - $528. Applicant believes that this is a duplicate of the unpaid debt alleged \nat 1.k., a debt owed for a class for which her son registered. The amounts owed are the \nsame, and the debt at 1.w. refers to an education-related debt (GE 4; Tr. 43-44). \n \n1.ee. - $25 owed to a tax preparation service. Applicant testified that she paid it \nin 2007, and that she contacted the creditor about it. She provided no documentation to \nsupport her claim (Tr. 49-50). \n \n \n4\n\n \nThe remaining 20 delinquencies include two judgments and debts owed for credit \ncards; telephone, cell phone and electric bills; child care; and medical debts. These \ndebts are unpaid, with no arrangements or payment plans in place. Applicant sought \nfinancial counseling in 2007, but was informed that, with her large amount of debt, she \nshould try to pay off a few of the debts at a time on her own rather than put them in a \nconsolidation program (Tr. 57-58). \n \n \nApplicant's monthly net income is $2,684. Her rent, including utilities, is $859; \nhome phone/cable/internet services $129; cell phone $50; car payment plus insurance \nis $527; groceries $300; gas about $70; entertainment $15 per month; and after-school \ncare $279 per month. She pays $200 per month for two delinquent debts (allegations \n1.d. and 1.e.). She contributes to a 401(k) and has a balance of approximately $3,000. \nNow that she has finished paying her student loans, she plans to use the money she \nhad paid on those debts to start paying on a few other debts. Applicant estimates that \nshe has about $20 monthly net remainder after paying her expenses and debts (Tr. 51-\n57). \n \n \nApplicant was arrested twice on fraud charges. In October 2003, she was \narrested in relation to a May 2003 felony charge of credit card theft. The charge was \ndismissed. In February 2004, Applicant was arrested again related to a March 2003 \nincident. She was charged with two felonies: credit card theft and credit card fraud. On \nthe advice of her attorney, Applicant signed a plea agreement. In exchange for pleading \nguilty to credit card fraud, the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and the felony \ncredit card theft charge was not prosecuted. Applicant was sentenced to 12 months in \njail, suspended; and ordered to serve three years supervised probation, pay restitution \nof $162 and costs of $207; and complete community service. Applicant believes her \nprobation ended approximately three months after sentencing, when she completed her \ncommunity service, because the probation officer told her that she did not have to return \nany more (GE 7, 8; AE C; Tr. 58-62). \n \n \nApplicant testified that the offenses charged in March 2003 and May 2003 \nactually relate to only one incident. She and a few co-workers bought season passes for \nan amusement park. The monthly payments of approximately $50 were to be charged \nautomatically on Applicant's credit card account. Two payments for Applicant's pass \nwere charged to another person\u2019s credit card. Applicant believes that the amusement \npark company mistakenly charged the two payments to her card. The company accused \nApplicant of fraudulently using the other person\u2019s card to pay for her pass. Applicant \nand the other card holder did not know each other, and initially the charge was \ndismissed for lack of evidence.  (Tr. 58-60). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she did not plead guilty to the charge of \ncredit card fraud. She explained that she signed a statement saying she was not guilty \nbut was only taking the plea based on circumstances and on the advice of her attorney: \n \n5\n\n \n \nQ: And then the thing I wanted to clarify then about the credit card \nfraud charge, you said that you signed a statement that you were \nnot guilty? \n \nA: Yes. It was a statement you sign stating that you're not pleading \nguilty to the charges, that you had done anything but you're taking a \nplea because of circumstances, I'm trying to remember this \nstatement, I'm sure my lawyer has it.  But you're taking the plea \nbecause of being advised by your lawyer that it is to your best \ninterest. (Tr. 66-67). \n \nApplicant provided a copy of the statement that she signed. She hand-wrote \u201cYes\u201d or \n\u201cNo\u201d responses to a number of statements. Among the statements are the following: \n \n5. Have you discussed with your lawyer whether you should plead \nguilty or not guilty? \n \n[Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d] \n \n6. After the discussion, did you decide for yourself that you should \nplead guilty? \n \n[Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d] \n \n8. Are you entering the plea of guilty because you are, in fact, \nguilty of the crime(s) charged? \n \n[Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d] \n \n \n[If the Defendant answers \u201cNo,\u201d] \n \n \n[A] Have the Commonwealth summarize the evidence on \nthe record. \n \n[B] Ask the defendant, \u201cAre you pleading guilty because \nthis is the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and you do not wish to take \nthe risk that you will be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d \n \n[Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d] \n \nAlthough Applicant testified that she did not plead guilty, Applicant's plea agreement \nindicates that she did enter a guilty plea. Although she asserted her innocence, she \naccepted the plea because evidence existed that could have resulted in her being found \nguilty at a trial (AE C; Tr. 66-67). \n \n \nApplicant listed on her security clearance application that she left her job after the \nfraud charges, \u201c\u2026because I did not want to work for a company that did not trust me.\u201d \n \n6\n\n \nAt the hearing, when asked if she was \u201claid off\u201d as a result of the charges, she testified, \n\u201cYes, because they came to my job and arrested me\u201d and \u201cI was actually pretty much \nfired.\u201d Nevertheless, Applicant applied for and received unemployment compensation \nafter she left the job. The state unemployment commission found that she was not \nentitled to compensation and Applicant was required to return the money she received. I \nfind that she left the job by her own choice, and therefore, was not entitled to \nunemployment compensation (see allegation 1.e.) (GE 1; Tr. 27-28, 59-61). \n \n \nApplicant submitted a performance evaluation covering the first half of 2009. She \nwas rated as Outstanding in one category and Exceeds Expectations in 8 of 14 other \ncategories (AE A; Tr. 16).  \n \nPolicies \n \nEach trustworthiness decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition under any \nguideline does not determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against \nthem, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to \nsensitive information. \n \nA trustworthiness decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to sensitive information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke an Applicant\u2019s access to sensitive information. Additionally, the \ngovernment must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the \ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or \nmitigate the government\u2019s case. \n                                           \n \nA person who has access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \n \n6 Directive. 6.3. \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).  \n \n \n7\n\n \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as \nhers or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \nThe facts presented support application of the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations), and AG \u00b619(d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices \nsuch as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense \naccount fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust). Applicant started with a clean financial slate after the discharge of her Chapter \n7 bankruptcy in 2002. However, she accumulated a substantial amount of new debt \nsince that time, as shown in her credit bureau reports, her interrogatory responses, and \nher admissions to the SOR allegations. In addition, Applicant pled guilty to credit card \nfraud, and applied for and received unemployment compensation to which she was not \nentitled. AG \u00b619(a), (c) and (d) apply. \n \n \nThe financial considerations guideline includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. The following mitigating conditions are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \n                                            \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00a72(b). \n \n8\n\n \n \n9\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue; \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s current delinquencies began approximately seven years \nago, most remain unresolved. Given that Applicant does not have the resources to \nresolve her significant debt load, her indebtedness will likely continue into the future. \nMoreover, Applicant's guilty plea to a charge of credit card fraud, and her application \nfor unemployment compensation after she had left a job by her own choice, raise \nquestions as to her trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot be applied. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Several events occurred that affected Applicant's \nfinances and were beyond her control: her own serious illness, two periods of \nunemployment since 2002, and lack of child support. Applicant provided evidence that \nshe has paid two debts, and is paying on another. However, to be applicable, this \nmitigating condition requires that the person act responsibly under the circumstances. \nBeyond these few efforts, Applicant has not contacted creditors, reported perceived \nduplicate debts to the credit reporting agencies, or established a plan to resolve her \nmany remaining debts. Without such a plan, Applicant's finances are not under control \nand AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are unavailable. The partial mitigation available under \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is insufficient to mitigate Applicant's conduct. I find against the Applicant on \nGuideline F. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the \nrelevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \n\n \n \n10\n                                           \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the appropriate \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is a single parent with significant debt. She does not receive child \nsupport, and has experienced medical problems and some unemployment. In 2002, \nshe discharged approximately $120,000 in debt through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nDespite starting with a clean financial slate, delinquencies began to accrue in that \nsame year. Applicant has paid two of the debts alleged in the SOR, and provided some \nevidence of a payment plan for another debt. She provided no evidence to support her \nclaim that she has paid several other debts, and has a second payment plan in place. \nIn addition, she has no plan to deal with the substantial remaining debt. Moreover, \nApplicant pled guilty to a charge of credit card fraud, and applied for unwarranted \nunemployment compensation. Her conduct raises questions as to her trustworthiness \nand good judgment. A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information \nbearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of public trust shows she has not \nsatisfied the doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s \ninterests. Such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.7 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence does not satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to sensitive information. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n\n \n \n11\n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e. \u2013 1.h.:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(withdrawn by the government) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j. - 1.y.: \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.z. - 1.aa.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.bb. - 1.ee.: \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ff. - 1.gg.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.hh.: \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ii.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(withdrawn by the government) \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to sensitive \ninformation.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 15, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF86), on July 1, 2005\n(Item 4). On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nconcerning the Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n Applicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on January 5, 2009, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on March 20, 2009. The Applicant received the FORM on April\n1, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. He submitted\nadditional information on May 1, 2009. The Department Counsel had no objection to this\n\n2\nmaterial and it is admitted into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. The case was\nassigned to another Administrative Judge on May 7, 2009.  It was reassigned to me on\nMay 18, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 38 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admitted all of the allegations\nunder this paragraph.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  \n1.a.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $929 for a department store account since 2001. This debt has not been\npaid.\n1.b.

The Applicant denies that he is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount  of $312 for a credit card account. He states in his Answer that this debt was\npaid. The Applicant did not submit any documentary evidence to support this statement.\nThe most recent credit report in the file, dated September 30, 2008, shows this debt as\nbeing due and owing. (Item 8 at 2.)\n1.d.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a medical provider in the amount\nof $124 since 2002.  This debt has not been paid.\n1.e.

The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $643 for a telephone bill since 2004. This debt has not been paid.\n\n3\n1.i.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a fourth medical provider in the\namount of $237 since 2005. This debt has not been paid.\n1.j.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the amount\nof $307 for a past due bill since 2005. This debt has not been paid.\n1.k.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a fifth medical provider in the\namount of $863 since 2006. This debt has not been paid.\n1.l.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a sixth medical provider in the\namount of $1,308 since 2007.  This debt has not been paid.\n1.m.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to the Department of Education in\nthe approximate amount of $9,873 for a defaulted student loan since 2007. This debt\nhas not been paid. The Applicant states in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 5 that he has been in\ncontact with the Department of Education about this debt, and will \u201cdetermine immediate\nplans of action to make my account current.\u201d \n1.n.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to the Department of Education in\nthe approximate amount of $14,475 for a defaulted student loan since 2007. This debt\nhas not been paid. The Applicant states in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 5 that he has been in\ncontact with the Department of Education about this debt, and will \u201cdetermine immediate\nplans of action to make my account current.\u201d\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own commonsense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b618:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b619(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has over $ 30,000 in past due\ndebts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\n\n5\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily after 2001.  He states that he has paid one debt in\nthe amount of $312, but has done nothing to pay any of the other debts. The fact that\nthe rest of the debts have been due and owing for so long is troubling. This mitigating\ncondition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant argues that many of these debts\ncame from financial hardship.  However, he has been employed by his current employer\nsince January 2005 and there is no evidence that he has acted responsibly with regards\nto his substantial debt during that time.  He states that he will resolve these debts in a\n\u201ctimely manner.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 5.)  A statement that he intends to resolve the\nindebtedness in the future is not sufficient evidence that he can or will resolve the debts.\nI cannot find under these particular facts that the Applicant has acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances.\nAG \u00b6 20(c) states that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthere are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s credit reports show\nthat, in the main, he is making sufficient payments on his current indebtedness.\nHowever, as stated above, a desire to resolve his substantial past due indebtedness is\nnot enough.  This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nBased on all of the available evidence, I cannot find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the allegations under this Guideline.  Paragraph 1 is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making such a decision: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n6\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a history of not\npaying his debts.  As set forth above, I cannot find that there have been permanent\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  In addition, I find that there is the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is a likelihood of\nrecurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She also has a substantial history of domestic violence offenses spanning\nmultiple relationships and court-ordered treatment programs. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to ADP I/II/III sensitive\ninformation is denied.\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office\n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant\nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD\nC3I) entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness\ndeterminations for contractor personnel employed in Sensitive Information Systems\nPositions (ADP I/II/III), as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation).\nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P), on May 24,\n2007.

She answered the\nSOR in writing on June 4, 2009, and requested that her case be decided by an\nadministrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  Department Counsel\n1\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 7, 2009. A complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant on July 8, 2009, and she was\n2\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of her copy of the\nFORM on July 20, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. She provided no further response to\nthe FORM within the 30-day period she was given to do so, did not request additional\ntime to respond, and made no objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by\nDepartment Counsel.

Only the eldest child lives with Applicant and her\nhusband, who she married in September 2006.3\nIn her answer to the SOR, dated June 4, 2009, Applicant admitted the financial\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., and 1.o. of the SOR, with explanations.

She\n4\nprovided no evidence of any financial education, progress toward establishing a budget,\nor attempts to resolve any delinquent debts in response to the SOR or the FORM. \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) on October 17, 2007, and again on November 7, 2007. She\ndiscussed her delinquent debts and the resulting potential security concerns with the\ninvestigator, and said that her life was becoming more stable and she hoped to improve\nher credit by paying off her bills as she could. She claimed, without corroboration, that\nshe and her husband had a combined monthly net remainder of more than $3,000 after\nmeeting their living expenses and current debt payments. She attested to the accuracy\nof these statements on October 22, 2008, as part of her response to DOHA\ninterrogatories.  She provided no explanation for the absence of any progress toward\n5\nresolving her admitted delinquent debts during the more than two years since her OPM\ninterviews, while claiming to have more than $36,000 per year available for that\npurpose. \nAs noted above concerning SOR \u00b6 1.a., Applicant documented her satisfaction\nof the $429 judgment against her for past-due child support through wage\ngarnishment.  She claimed that all of the alleged delinquent medical debts were\n6\nerroneously reported on her credit reports because she was covered by Medicaid when\nshe incurred them. In support of this claim, she provided a \u201cMedicaid Management\nInformation System Certificate of Coverage\u201d from her state Department of Health. This\ndocument shows that she was entitled to Medicaid or her state\u2019s Medical Assistance\nProgram during the periods from August 1, 2003, to January 31, 2004, and from\nSeptember 1, 2004, to February 28, 2005.  The record credit reports indicate that all of\n7\nthe delinquent medical debts that Applicant denied accrued during times that were\noutside these two windows of Medicaid coverage.  \n8\nThe largest of these debts is for $15,023 (\u00b6 1.j.), which  was placed for collection\nin May 2004. In her OPM interview and her answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that\nthis debt was for hospital expenses incurred during the birth of her son in November\n2003. That was a month during which she was eligible for Medicaid coverage, but she\nprovided no evidence from which a link between this debt and that event could be\nconfirmed. Applicant also forwarded copies of dispute letters to each SOR-listed\n\nItem 3 at 5 through 15.\n9\n10\nIn her October 22, 2008, response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant wrote, \u201cAll medical bills showing a\nbalance are not necessarily true and correct. I was covered by Medicaid during the time of treatment,\nespecially the one of $15,023. I will start doing what I need to, to remedy these debts reflected on my report.\u201d\nApplicant did not explain why she waited until the day she responded to the SOR to begin disputing those\ndebts with the creditors. \nSee Item 3 at 3; Item 4 at 7; Item 8 at 3-5; Item 10 at 2. \n11\n4\nmedical creditor, all dated June 4, 2009, with her answer to the SOR of the same date.9\nShe provided no further evidence concerning the status of any of these disputed\naccounts by her August 20, 2009, deadline to respond to the FORM.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish the following facts\nconcerning her criminal conduct.  She was arrested in March 2001 and charged with\n11\nDisorderly Conduct. During the fall of 2002, she and the father of her eldest child had a\nfight in the presence of the then-5-year-old. Based on the son\u2019s description of events to\nthe police, Applicant was arrested and charged with Domestic Violence in Presence of\nChild and Assault. Applicant pled guilty to the charge of Simple Assault and was fined.\nIn her OPM interview and answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed she was actually the\nvictim in the incident, contrary to her guilty plea. She offered no evidence to corroborate\nthis version of events.\nDuring February 2003, Applicant had a fight with the man who became the father\nof her two youngest children, with whom she was then living, when she caught him\nkissing another woman. She left the scene of the fight, but was arrested shortly\nthereafter and charged with Domestic Violence Assault, Disorderly Conduct, and\nCriminal Trespass. She entered into a plea-in-abeyance agreement, under which the\ncourt accepted her guilty pleas but agreed not to enter convictions on the charges if she\ncomplied with the stipulated probationary conditions. These included her successful\ncompletion of a domestic violence class.  \nApplicant admitted that she was arrested for Simple Assault in about July 2003\nin her answer to \u00b6 2.d of the SOR, and said it was dismissed because she was found\nnot to be the guilty party. On her SF 85P, she listed a conviction and fine for Disorderly\nConduct in July 2003 in response to question 16. Her FBI Identification Record lists an\narrest for Assault on October 14, 2003, but none during July 2003. During her OPM\ninterview, she said that she did not recall being arrested in October 2003, but did not\ndeny that it occurred. She also said that she and the man involved in the February 2003\nincident lived together until May 2006, and \u201cverbally fought\u201d all the time. I find that the\narrest for Assault alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. actually occurred in October 2003. \nApplicant was arrested again in October 2005, and charged with Simple Assault\nand Criminal Mischief. At the time, she and her boyfriend were living apart and he was\nunder a restraining order not to be in her presence. When both arrived at the home of a\nmutual friend, they fought over who should leave. Applicant wound up throwing a rock\n\nItem 3 at 20-22.\n12\n5\nat her boyfriend\u2019s truck and caused $400 in damage. She pled guilty to the Criminal\nMischief charge and was sentenced to a fine, 30 days in jail (all suspended), one year\nof supervised probation, and ordered to complete another domestic violence program\nand pay restitution. Applicant was arrested for Assault a final time in either November\n2005 or January 2006. This charge was dismissed after she again completed domestic\nviolence counseling. \nThree supervisors with whom Applicant has worked during the two years in her\npresent position wrote letters praising her work performance, initiative, and dedication.\nThey also expressed high opinions of her trustworthiness and good character.  I was\n12\nunable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or character in person since she elected to\nhave her case decided without a hearing.  \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for .\n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d\nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny\ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe \ntrustworthiness \nconcerns \nrelating \nto \nthe \nguideline \nfor \nFinancial\nConsiderations are set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated $31,269 in delinquent debts\nbetween 2001 and 2006. She only repaid one $429 judgment, through a wage\ngarnishment, despite claiming to have sufficient excess income to have paid them all.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\n\n7\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of inability or unwillingness to pay her debts spans more than eight years, and\ncontinues to date. She provided no evidence this would not continue or recur, so this\nmitigating condition is not supported by the record.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose before her present employment because she spent more to support\nherself and her children than she earned. In 2006 she married a man who reportedly\nhas a good income, and in 2007 she began working for her current employer. For more\nthan the past two years, she reports having over $3,000 per month in discretionary\nincome after paying living expenses. However, she did not provide an explanation for\nher failure to make payments, or documentation supporting an attempt to resolve her\nsubstantial delinquent debt. She has not met her burden to establish that this potentially\nmitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Her effort to document counseling by\nsubmitting a printout of a financial counselor\u2019s web site is insufficient to support\napplication of this provision, particularly absent evidence of resolution of more than\n$30,000 in delinquent debt. Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d The only resolution of an SOR-alleged debt took place because the\njudgment creditor garnished her wages for past-due child support. This does not\nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve her debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) pertains to documentation\nof a legitimate basis to dispute the debts in question. Applicant submitted copies of\ndispute letters purportedly mailed to her medical creditors on the day she responded to\nthe SOR, but failed to demonstrate any legitimate basis for the dispute since the debts\nwere incurred during periods outside the times for which she documented her eligibility\nfor Medicaid.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The conditions supported by this record are, \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted,\n\n8\nor convicted.\u201d Applicant was arrested six times between 2001 and 2006 for Disorderly\nConduct, Assault, and Criminal Mischief related to multiple incidents of domestic\nviolence. None of these incidents was particularly serious, and some charges were later\ndismissed, but the pattern and recidivism, despite attending numerous domestic\nviolence treatment programs, support significant concerns about her judgment and her\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. These are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (b) provide minimal, if any, mitigation in this case. Applicant is\nno longer in relationships with the fathers of her first child, or her third and fourth\nchildren, who were the victims of her domestic violence offenses. There is no evidence\nshe was pressured or coerced into those crimes, however. She has not had any such\nincidents with her husband to date, but the repeated crimes following court-ordered\ntreatment and the relative recency of the last offenses preclude a finding that such\nconduct is unlikely to recur or that it  does not cast doubt on her good judgment. \nApplicant provided no evidence to corroborate her assertions that she was\nwrongly accused in some of these incidents, and her convictions after pleading guilty\ncollaterally estop a finding that she did not commit those offenses. Accordingly, AG \u00b6\n32(c) does not provide substantial mitigation. Applicant did provide some evidence of a\nrecent good employment record, and has not committed additional offenses during the\npast three years. She has thus proven some mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(d). The weight of\nthis evidence does not yet meet her burden of persuasion, however, when considered\nin light of the length and repetitive pattern of her offenses spanning multiple years,\nrelationships, and treatment programs. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\n\n9\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and\nexperienced individual who is accountable for her choices. She incurred more than\n$30,000 in delinquent debts over a six year period by spending more than she earned.\nOver the past two years, she claims to have more than $36,000 per year in excess\nincome over her living expenses, yet only resolved one small delinquent debt as a result\nof wage garnishment. She made no effective effort to arrange resolution of the\nremaining debts, however, demonstrating neither rehabilitation nor permanent\nbehavioral changes. The potential for pressure or duress from her creditors leading to\nexploitation or misuse of sensitive information remains substantial. Her pattern of\nsignificant financial delinquency makes continuation or recurrence of financial\nirresponsibility more likely than not. \nHer history and repetitive pattern of domestic violence offenses are similarly\nserious, frequent, and recent when viewed as a whole. She is now, apparently, in a\nbetter relationship with her husband and has begun to demonstrate rehabilitation. It is\ntoo soon, however, to reach a reasonable finding that the judgment and reliability issues\nraised by Applicant\u2019s financial and criminal history are sufficiently in the past to alleviate\nresulting trustworthiness concerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations and criminal conduct. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\npublic trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 In his SOR response, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 2.a, 3.a, 4.a, 4.d and 4.e with some explanations (GE 10). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 5, 19).3 He has worked for the contractor as a painter since 1996 (Tr. 19, 61). He does not now and never has had access to classified material (Tr. 6, 46). He married his spouse in 1999; and has two children ages five and three (Tr. 20; GE 1). Applicant earned a high school diploma and has not attended college (Tr. 5, 19). He has never served in the military (GE 1). His security application did not disclose a police record, or a felony conviction. There is no indication of illegal drug abuse or mental disability. He has never left employment under adverse circumstances. When he completed his 2006 SF 86, he disclosed his bankruptcy (GE 1). Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference Applicant\u2019s grandmother living in the United States obtained approval and Applicant, his parents and his sisters emigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1990 (Tr. 20). Applicant\u2019s parents were both born in Cuba and now are U.S. residents and citizens (Tr. 30, 34). Since emigrating from Cuba in 1990, his father visited Cuba three times, and his mother visited Cuba twice (Tr. 35). Applicant\u2019s father is a pastor and comm",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) alleged four delinquent debts. Two were \ndischarged in his 2004 bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s first and second mortgage total \n$233,857. He failed to make any mortgage payments for the last nine months, accruing \nan additional $20,000 in delinquent debt. He currently retains a valid Cuban passport. \nApplicant failed to mitigate financial considerations and foreign preference security \nconcerns. Foreign influence and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nEligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 26, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On August 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 9 (SOR, dated August 12, 2008). GE 9 is the source for the facts in the \nremainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nDecember 31, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference), B (Foreign Influence), E \n(Personal Conduct) and F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn September 26, 2008, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR response, and \nApplicant requested a hearing (GE 10). Department Counsel indicated he was ready to \nproceed on November 17, 2008, and on that same date the case was assigned to me. \nAt the hearing held on December 9, 2008, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits \n(GEs 1-8, 12) (Transcript (Tr.) 16), and Applicant offered six exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n(AE A-F) (Tr. 48-50). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-8, 12 and AEs A-\nF (Tr. 16-17, 34-35, 50). Additionally, I admitted the SOR (GE 9), his SOR response \n(GE 10), and a Hearing Notice (GE 11). Applicant received more than 15 days notice of \nhis hearing (Tr. 28). I received the transcript on December 16, 2008.   \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel asked me to take administrative notice concerning materials \nrelated to the Cuba (Tr. 13-14; GE 12). Department Counsel offered in support of the \nrequested administrative notice of facts concerning Cuba, supporting documents to \nshow detail and context for those facts (Ex. I to VII\u2014listed in Request for Administrative \nNotice at 3-4). I responded that I would take administrative notice of the facts in the \nfour-page cover document; but not the underlying documents (Tr. 14). The parties did \nnot object to my ruling (Tr. 14, 17-18).   \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Exhibits I to VII are \nattached to GE 12 to ensure the administrative record is complete.  \n\n \n \n3 \n \n                                           \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \n2.a, 3.a, 4.a, 4.d and 4.e with some explanations (GE 10). His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.    \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 5, 19).3 He has \nworked for the contractor as a painter since 1996 (Tr. 19, 61). He does not now and \nnever has had access to classified material (Tr. 6, 46). He married his spouse in 1999; \nand has two children ages five and three (Tr. 20; GE 1). Applicant earned a high school \ndiploma and has not attended college (Tr. 5, 19). He has never served in the military \n(GE 1). His security application did not disclose a police record, or a felony conviction. \nThere is no indication of illegal drug abuse or mental disability. He has never left \nemployment under adverse circumstances. When he completed his 2006 SF 86, he \ndisclosed his bankruptcy (GE 1).  \n \nForeign Influence and Foreign Preference \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother living in the United States obtained approval and \nApplicant, his parents and his sisters emigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1990 \n(Tr. 20). Applicant\u2019s parents were both born in Cuba and now are U.S. residents and \ncitizens (Tr. 30, 34). Since emigrating from Cuba in 1990, his father visited Cuba three \ntimes, and his mother visited Cuba twice (Tr. 35). Applicant\u2019s father is a pastor and \ncommunicated with pastors who live in Cuba (Tr. 45).   \n \nApplicant was 10 or 11 years old when he immigrated to the United States (Tr. \n21). Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Puerto Rico and she is a U.S. citizen (Tr. 36). His two \nchildren are U.S. citizens (Tr. 72). Applicant\u2019s grandmother on his father\u2019s side of the \nfamily, three uncles and five first cousins are citizens and residents of Cuba (SOR \u00b6 2.a, \nGE 10). Applicant may communicate with his grandmother three times a year when his \nparents call her, and typically these communications occur when the family gathers \ntogether on holidays (Tr. 40-41). Applicant does not call her on his own (Tr. 41). He has \nthree uncles living in Cuba, who are his father\u2019s brothers (Tr. 41-42). His uncles living in \nCuba do not have telephones, and the only time he might have talked to them was if his \nfather called his grandmother and his uncle or uncles happened to be at her residence \n(Tr. 43). Applicant had about five first cousins living in Cuba (Tr. 43). His only contact \nwith his first cousins was during his visit to Cuba in 2006 (Tr. 44). \n \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \n3GE 1 (2006 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant was unsure about whether his relatives living in Cuba had served in the \nCuban military, served in the Cuban government or received pensions from the Cuban \ngovernment (Tr. 37-40, 42-44). Applicant visited his family in Cuba in November 2006 \nfor a week when he accompanied his parents and three sisters on the trip from the \nUnited States to Cuba (Tr. 24, 35, 46; SOR \u00b6 2.b, GE 10). Applicant does not own any \nproperty in Cuba (Tr. 45). \n \nApplicant admitted exercising dual citizenship with Cuba and the United States \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a, GE 10). He possessed a Cuban passport that was issued on July 14, 2006, \nand it is not due to expire until July 13, 2012 (Tr. 21-23; SOR \u00b6 1.b, GE 10). He used his \nCuban passport to enter and exit Cuba in 2006 (Tr. 46). He did not receive any \nfinancial, educational, medical or other benefits from Cuba after emigrating from Cuba \nin 1990 (Tr. 29). He did not exercise any other rights of a Cuban citizen after leaving \nCuba in 1990 (aside from his 2006 use of his Cuban passport) (Tr. 29). Applicant \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996 prior to applying for the Cuban passport (Tr. \n21; SOR \u00b6 1.c). At the time of his hearing, he retained his Cuban passport (Tr. 23-26). \nHe offered to give his Cuban passport to his facility security officer (FSO); however, he \nwanted to be able to use his Cuban passport if there was an emergency with a family \nmember in Cuba (Tr. 25). He does not intend to live in Cuba (Tr. 46). His loyalty is to the \nUnited States (Tr. 47).  He did not provide any evidence that he actually turned-in his \nCuban passport to his FSO. \n    \nRepublic of Cuba \n \nCuba is a totalitarian state, which controls all aspects of life through the \nCommunist party. Cuba has engaged in numerous human rights violations such as \nabuse of detainees, unlawful killings and beatings, and threats and abuse of Cuban \ncitizens. The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the early \n1960s, when Castro forcibly took over the Cuban government after several years of \narmed struggle. The United States continues to maintain economic sanctions against \nthe Cuban government. Since 1982, Cuba has been on the U.S. State Department\u2019s list \nof State Sponsors of Terrorism. Cuba maintains close relationships with Iran and Syria \nand has offered safe havens for members of terrorist organizations. Cuba targets the \nUnited States for intensive espionage activities, and there have been numerous \nreported cases of Cuban espionage against the United States.      \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant admitted that he answered, \u201cNo\u201d on his September 26, 2006, security \nclearance application in response to Section 17d, which asked about whether in the last \nseven years he had an active passport issued by a foreign government (GE 10). He \nadmitted he had a currently valid Cuban passport; however, he thought the question \nwas seeking information about whether he had a passport to a country in addition to \neither Cuba or the United States (Tr. 32-33). He disclosed on this same security \nclearance application that he was born in Cuba and considered himself a dual citizen of \n\n \n \n5 \n \nCuba and the United States (Tr. 33, GE 1). He did not consider Cuba to be a \u201cforeign\u201d \ngovernment (Tr. 33).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife became unemployed, which resulted in the loss of \nincome and created financial problems (Tr. 51). After 2003, she was sporadically \nunemployed (Tr. 61-62). In 2007, her salary decreased from $14.50 an hour to $10.00 \nhourly (AE C, D). In 2008, she had been making about $1,200 per month as a \nreceptionist (Tr. 60). When she became unemployed, she received unemployment \ncompensation; however, it was insufficient to kept their debts current (Tr. 61). In July \n2004, Applicant petitioned for bankruptcy and his unsecured debts were discharged in \nOctober 2004 (Tr. 50-51; SOR \u00b6 4.a, GE 10; AE A). The SOR listed two delinquent \ndebts that were discharged in the 2004 bankruptcy: $1,084 reported on a credit report \nas delinquent in March 2004 (Tr. 52-54; SOR \u00b6 4.b, GE 6, 10; AE A), and $2,030 \nreported delinquent on a credit report in June 2004 (Tr. 52-53; SOR \u00b6 4.c, GE 10).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s first mortgage in the approximate amount of $187,057 and second \nmortgage in the approximate amount of $46,800 became delinquent in February 2008 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.d and 4.e). His monthly payments on the two accounts totaled $2,375 (Tr. \n70). In his SOR response, dated around September 26, 2008, he said he has placed his \ntwo mortgages under a short sale transaction and predicted it would be \u201csettle[d] or \nsolved within 2 to 3 months\u201d (GE 10). As of December 9, 2008, Applicant\u2019s agent was \nlooking for someone to purchase his residence at a suitable price (Tr. 54). Applicant has \nnot made any payments on his mortgages since February 2008 (Tr. 55). First he sent \nthe mortgage holders a letter asking to readjust the mortgage to lower payments and \nthen he sent a letter and short sale assignment indicating he wanted to resolve the \ndebts with a short sale (Tr. 56-57; AE B, C, D). The mortgage holders have not replied \nto his short sale proposal (Tr. 58). \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS) as \npart of an Office of Personnel Management interview, indicating he had negative \nmonthly net income of $850 (Tr. 67, GE 5). After completing this PFS, his financial \nsituation became worse as his spouse became unemployed (Tr. 67). He has taken two \nloans out for about $15,000 against his 401K program, which he valued at about \n$30,000 (Tr. 69). He is attempting to repay his 401K program (Tr. 69).   \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant began a financial counseling program, which \naddressed 13 debts totaling $10,924 with monthly payments of $410 (Tr. 62-66; SOR \u00b6 \n1.f, GE 10). As of November 2008, the balance owed on this program was $10,415 (AE \nE). His car payments and insurance are not part of this program (Tr. 66). Even though \nApplicant was saving $2,375 per month by not paying his mortgages (which was \nsubstantially more than the $1,200 monthly his wife was receiving before she became \nunemployed), they still had negative income each month (Tr. 71). His mortgagees have \nnot foreclosed on his residence. His wife is currently employed (Tr. 73). \n  \n\n \n \n6 \n \nRecommendation \n \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) described Applicant as a \u201cmodel \nemployee, as asset to the corporation and an exemplary citizen.  .  .  . [His] personal \nconduct, trustworthiness, reliability and honesty have [led] to a steady progression of \npromotion to higher levels of responsibility and expectation by his supervisors and \nmanagement\u201d (AE F). His FSO opined that Applicant had taken necessary actions to \ncorrect his financial problems and recommended approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance (AE F).       \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n   \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude relevant security concern are under Guidelines C (Foreign \nPreference), B (Foreign Influence), F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal \nConduct).  \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. These conditions state, \u201c10(a) exercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport.\u201d \n \nApplicant renewed his Cuban passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. He \ncontinues to possess a Cuban passport that will continue to be valid until 2012, \nestablishing AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). \u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                           \nraised financial considerations security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to \nestablish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.       \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Security officials did not authorize \nApplicant\u2019s possession or use of his Cuban passport, and he did not invalidate or \nrelinquish his Cuban passport as described in AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and 11(e).4 His Cuban \npassport was not surrendered to his security officer. He obtained and used the Cuban \npassport after he became a U.S. citizen.  If he had surrendered his Cuban passport to \nhis FSO, as he offered to do, I would have mitigated foreign preference security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 11(e); however, because he did not do so, this security concern \ncannot be mitigated.     \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \n \n4In the decretal paragraph, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.c because all \nforeign preference security concerns relate to his possession and use of a currently valid Cuban passport. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are essentially restatements of this security concern and those comments are hereby \nmerged into SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n\n \n \n9 \n \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother, three uncles and five cousins, are citizens and \nresidents of Cuba. Applicant visited his Cuban relatives in 2006 for a week. He spoke to \nhis grandmother on the telephone about three times per year on holidays, when his \nfather telephoned her. His relatives may have connections to the Cuban government or \nmilitary. For example, his grandmother may be receiving a pension from the Cuban \ngovernment. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members. See ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 20, 2002). However, his grandmother, uncles and cousins are not immediate \nfamily members and this presumption does not apply. Since 1990, he has only gone to \nCuba on one occasion, and then only stayed for a week.     \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or there is a serious \nproblem in the country with crime or terrorism. Cuba\u2019s hostile relationship to the United \nStates, Cuba\u2019s failure to adhere to human rights standards, Cuba\u2019s support of terrorists, \n\n \n \n10 \n \nand Cuba\u2019s espionage targeting of the United States, place a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith family members living in Cuba do not pose a security risk and he is not in a position \nto be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his family living in \nCuba. With the ongoing hostile relationship between Cuba and the United States, it is \nconceivable that Cuban intelligence officials would target any Cuban citizen or former \nCuban citizen living in Cuba or the United States in an attempt to gather valuable \ninformation from the United States. \n \nThere is evidence that Cuban intelligence officials seek classified information \nfrom the United States. Applicant\u2019s connections to his family members living in Cuba \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because these relationships are sufficiently close to \nraise a possible security concern about his desire to help these relatives living in Cuba \nby providing classified information.    \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships and \ncontacts with his family members living in Cuba to raise the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. There is clear evidence that Cuba remains a lawless \ntotalitarian state, and Applicant\u2019s family living in Cuba are available should Cuban \nofficials seek to exploit them to obtain classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, \nrequiring further review and analysis.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to his family members living \nin Cuba. Applicant has an emotional bond with his family members living in Cuba, and \nthrough his parents with his family, living in Cuba. Applicant communicates with them \nsufficiently to negate these mitigating conditions. Additionally, he was reluctant to turn-in \nhis Cuban passport because he wanted it to be available should there be an emergency \nfor the family living in Cuba. Although Applicant\u2019s close relationships with his parents \nand his family members living in Cuba are an important positive reflection of his \ncharacter, these same close relationships raise security concerns for possible foreign \ninfluence.       \n \nThere is no evidence that his family members living in Cuba have been political \nactivists or that they have high profile jobs with the Cuban government, the military or \nany news media. There is no evidence that terrorists, criminals or the Cuban \nGovernment have approached or threatened Applicant\u2019s family members living in Cuba \nfor any reason. There is no evidence that these family members living in Cuba currently \nengage in activities which would bring attention to them or that they or other terrorists or \nother anti-U.S. elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s relationship with those family \nmembers. As such, there is a reduced possibility that these relatives would be targets \nfor coercion or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his relatives in Cuba, his frequent contacts with his \nparents (who frequently contact family members in Cuba) and Applicant\u2019s somewhat \nfrequent contacts with his grandmother living in Cuba, and the adversarial nature of the \nUnited States\u2019 relationship with the Cuban government, all weigh against mitigating \nsecurity concerns. See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007) \n(finding contacts with siblings in PRC \u201conce every two or three  months\u201d not to be casual \nand infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (finding \ncontacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per year not \ncasual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent).     \n \nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his two children, parents and three sisters \nliving in the United States and his strong connections to the United States developed \nover the last 18 years tend to mitigate foreign interest security concerns. Applicant has \n\u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d His spouse and \nchildren are U.S. citizens, and they all reside in the United States. He and his spouse \n\n \n \n12 \n \nare fully inculcated with U.S. values.  He has many friends and colleagues in the United \nStates. He is a loyal, dedicated U.S. citizen. He has provided a statement from his FSO \ncorroborating his loyalty and trustworthiness. Applicant has worked for the same \ngovernment contractor with dedication and distinction for 12 years. He has made \nsignificant contributions to national security and his company. All these circumstances \ndemonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or exploitation. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n8(b) is established and mitigates foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had . \n.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his credit report, his 2006 security clearance application and his \nSOR response. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleged four delinquent debts. Two SOR debts were \ndischarged by Applicant\u2019s 2004 bankruptcy. However, Applicant\u2019s first and second \nmortgage total $233,857. He failed to make any mortgage payments for the last nine \nmonths, accruing an additional $20,000 in delinquent debt. Even though he is not \npaying his mortgage, and his wife is now employed, they have a negative cash flow \neach month. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c).  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n \n13 \n \n                                           \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. His \nfinancial problems are not isolated because he currently has two large delinquent debts \ntotaling about $250,000. The ongoing nature of his delinquent debts is \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2002)). Moreover, I am not convinced his debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [her] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He discharged his delinquent debts in 2004 using \nbankruptcy, and now has even much more delinquent debt than he had in 2004. \nAlthough he has been paying some of his debts, he has failed to make any payments \non his mortgages for the last nine months.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s intermittent unemployment contributed to \ntheir financial problems. The substantial reduction in home values is another significant \nproblem. As such some of their debts are due to forces beyond their control. However, \nhe did not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or made sufficient efforts to address his delinquent debts.5 He receives \nsome credit for informing his creditors that he was not going to pay his mortgages and \nfor seeking a short sale; however, even though he was not paying his mortgages he still \nhad a negative cash flow and his extensive debts are increasing. Because of his \nspouse\u2019s periodic unemployment and the significant decline in home values, AG \u00b6 10(b) \npartially mitigates financial considerations security concerns.     \n \n \n5\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n\n \n \n14 \n \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant received financial counseling. \nHowever, there are no indications that \u201cthat the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol\u201d because the amount of delinquent debt is increasing more than $2,000 every \nmonth. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith6 in \nthe resolution of his delinquent SOR debts because he did not establish that his failure \nto pay his delinquent debts was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant did not dispute his responsibility for \nany debts. I conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct in regard to his delinquent debts casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He failed to resolve \nor pay his mortgages. He failed to make partial payments on his mortgages. He did not \nprovide good cause for his failure to pay or at least to set up payment plans and make \nsome payments despite having an opportunity to do so. Based on my evaluation of the \nrecord evidence as a whole, I conclude financial considerations are not mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n15 \n \n                                           \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges Applicant falsely denied on his 2006 security clearance \napplication that he did not have a foreign passport. Applicant admitted that he had a \nCuban passport.    \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) provides one condition that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase, \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d \nApplicant disclosed his birth in Cuba and his status as a dual citizen on his 2006 \nsecurity clearance application. He understood the term \u201cforeign\u201d in relation to his \npassport to request information about passports from countries other than Cuba or the \nUnited States. I specifically find Applicant\u2019s description of his state of mind when he \ncompleted his security clearance application to be credible. AG \u00b6 17(f) applies to \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his possession of a Cuban passport on his security \nclearance application. This failure was not deliberate, and the allegation of falsification \nis unsubstantiated.7 \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n\n \n \n16 \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I hereby incorporate all of my comments \nunder the preceding discussions of the four pertinent adjudicative guidelines into this \nsection.  \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. He has much greater connections to the United States than to Cuba, \nand I am confident he would resolve any conflict in favor of United States interests. His \ndedication to his work and his country is a very positive indication of his good character \nand trustworthiness. He is loyal to his country. Applicant\u2019s record of good employment \nand law-abiding character weighs in his favor. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation, or criminal activity. He received financial counseling. Some of his financial \nproblems arose from his spouse\u2019s periodic unemployment. His non-SOR debts are \ncurrent and being paid, or in a payment plan. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines are not sufficient to warrant access to classified information. His debts were \ndischarged in 2004 utilizing bankruptcy. The overall amount of unresolved debt is about \n$250,000 and substantial. He has been continuously employed for 12 years, and his \nwife\u2019s intermittently unemployment does not account for the magnitude of their \ndelinquent debt. When she has been employed, her income has been about $15,000 \nper year. Even when she was employed, and they were not making their monthly \nmortgage payments of $2,375; they still had a negative monthly cash flow. Applicant \nhas been aware of the security significance of his delinquent SOR debts since he \nreceived the SOR in August 2008, and his offer to resolve his delinquent mortgages \nwith the short sale of his residence in June 2008 is an inadequate attempt to resolve \nthese debts.  \n \nThe foreign preference security concern is substantial. After becoming a U.S. \ncitizen in 1996, Applicant renewed his Cuban passport in 2006. He used his Cuban \npassport for his 2006 visit to Cuba for one week. He did not relinquish or surrender his \nCuban passport to his facility security official (FSO). Even if he had relinquished his \nCuban passport to his FSO, I would still deny his access to classified information \nbecause of his financial problems.      \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations and foreign preference security concerns. Foreign influence and \npersonal conduct security concerns are mitigated.      \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n\n \n \n17 \n \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 25, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nconcerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 1, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on November 6, 2008. \nThe Notice of Hearing was issued on November 13, 2008, convening a hearing on \nDecember 18, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \npresented five exhibits, marked GEs 1-5, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and presented one witness and no documents. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 24, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR \u00b6 1 allegations (Guideline E). He failed to \nanswer the Guideline J allegation and I entered a denial. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old systems administrator for a corporation providing \nnetwork security to federal agencies. He has never been married and has no children. \nHe completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in information systems management in the summer \nof 2003 (Tr. 67). Thereafter, he has taken several network certification/administrator \ncourses to stay current in his field (Tr. 92).  \n \nAfter college, Applicant was unemployed for approximately seven months. In \nearly 2004, he was hired as a physical security guard for a government contractor. \nWhile in this job, he received access to classified information at the secret level in about \nAugust 2005. He was hired by his current employer, a defense contractor, in 2006. He \nhas been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, thereafter. He requires \naccess to classified information to access his clients\u2019 information technology systems. \nHe has held continuous access to classified information from 2005 to the day of his \nhearing.  \n \nIn August-September 2006, days after Applicant was hired by his current \nemployer, he smoked marijuana while travelling in a car with his cousin to attend a \nfriends\u2019 \u201cgathering\u201d in celebration of a pending football game (Tr. 63-64, 72-73). At the \ngathering, he smoked marijuana again by taking some hits from a marijuana cigarette \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthat was passed around. Applicant knew some of the 10-11 attendants at the gathering, \nbut not all of them. \n \nApplicant testified he illegally used marijuana \u201ca couple of times\u201d while attending \nhigh school from 1994 to 1998 (Tr. 82). He denied any use of marijuana between 1998 \nand 2006. He also denied any additional use or marijuana, or any use of illegal drugs, \nafter his August 2006 use of marijuana. Applicant denied ever buying and/or selling any \nillegal drugs. \n \nAs part of his hiring process, two days after his 2006 use of marijuana, Applicant \nwas required to submit a new security clearance application and to undergo a drug \ndetecting urinalysis test. In his response to \u00a7 24 of his September 2006 e-QIP (asking \nwhether since the age of 16 or in the last seven years he illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, i.e., marijuana), Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose his use of \nmarijuana. He knew that he was required to disclose his use of marijuana but elected \nnot to do so (Tr. 79). Applicant falsified his e-QIP because he was scared he would \nloose his new job, and/or that he would be denied access to classified information at the \ntop secret level (Tr. 72-72, 79).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s urinalysis test results came back positive for marijuana. When \nconfronted by his company\u2019s president (also the facility security officer), Applicant \ninitially denied he illegally used marijuana and attributed the positive urinalysis test to \npassive inhalation. The next day, after consulting with his pastor and his father, \nApplicant disclosed to his employer that he had in fact illegally used marijuana (GEs 4 \nand 5). He told his employer he had used marijuana once while riding in a car with \nfriends on their way to a football game. During a November 2006, interview with a \ngovernment investigator Applicant stated he used marijuana once in September 2006 \nwhile at a party in a friend\u2019s home. Applicant omitted information to both his employer \nand the investigator to minimize his drug involvement. \n \nApplicant explained he is not a frequent marijuana user. He used marijuana in \nAugust-September 2006 because of peer pressure at the social event. He was aware it \nis illegal to use marijuana. He considers his use of marijuana childish and immature. He \ntestified he is not a security risk, and that he would never betray the United States. He \nconsiders himself to be trustworthy and a good, reliable worker. During his hearing, \nApplicant promised never to use marijuana again. He testified that the likelihood of he \nsmoking marijuana again is \u201cvery slim\u201d (Tr. 75-75). He is aware of the serious security \nclearance concerns it raises, and the possibility of loosing his job. Since August 2006, \nApplicant has been in the presence of people using marijuana three or four times; the \nlast time during the summer of 2008 (Tr. 85). He was offered marijuana, but claimed he \ndid not use it (Tr. 86). Applicant explained he did not pay attention to the people using \nmarijuana, and that it did not bother him that they were using marijuana (Tr. 86). \n \nThe president, CEO and FSO of Applicant\u2019s company (X) testified at his hearing \n(Tr. 19-56). X hired Applicant, and has been his mentor since Applicant\u2019s 2006 drug \nuse. Applicant holds one of the must trusted positions in the company. He has \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nestablished an excellent reputation as a knowledgeable, dependable and honest \nemployee. X believes Applicant has made a personal and professional commitment to \nstay away from drugs. He also believes this was a one-time incident. Applicant \nparticipated in a six weeks drug rehabilitation/counseling program, and tested negative \nfor drugs in three random urinalyses tests since 2006. \n \nIn X\u2019s opinion, Applicant has matured and is meeting all expectations as a \nprofessional. Applicant has had no behavioral issues during the last two years. \nApplicant\u2019s performance has been so good that X would like to assign him to deal with \nspecific customers and contracts. He recommended Applicant receive a security \nclearance without reservations. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \n \n2  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \nIn 2006, Applicant illegally used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. \nTwo days later, he deliberately falsified his security clearance application when he failed \nto disclose his marijuana use. His falsification was knowledgeable and with the intent to \nmislead the government. When confronted, he initially lied to his employer about his \nillegal drug use; however, he recanted his false statement the next day. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his illegal use of marijuana because he \nwas scared he would loose his new job, and/or that he would be denied access to \nclassified information if he disclosed the truth. \n \nBecause of his maturity, education and experience holding a security clearance, \nApplicant knew or should have known the importance of accurately completing his \n \n3  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsecurity clearance application and telling the truth. Nevertheless, he failed to provide \ninformation that was material to making an informed security decision. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire\u201d and (b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority , or other official government representative,\u201d apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none applies to this case. \nApplicant made no effort to correct his falsification until he was confronted with his \npositive urinalysis test by his employer. Even then, he initially lied to his employer about \nhis use of marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (b) do not apply. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nI consider Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application a serious \noffense. I find his behavior aggravated because Applicant used marijuana while \npossessing a security clearance and employed as a security guard. Moreover, he \nfalsified his security clearance application knowing he was required to tell the truth. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification did not happen under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur. His actions cast doubt on the Applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n \n \n \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his drug use to his employer and his \nemployer\u2019s selfless mentoring of Applicant, he continues to associate with persons \ninvolved in the illegal use of drugs. Applicant has failed to change his behavior and did \nnot take positive action to reduce any possible vulnerability to exploitation. His \ncontinued association with persons involved in criminal activity casts doubt about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), \n(e), and (g) do not apply. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nApplicant falsified his security clearance application when he failed to disclose he \nused marijuana while possessing a security clearance. His falsification of the security \nclearance application is material and a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Making a false \nstatement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential \nsentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine).4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious \ncrime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.\u201d  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n                                            \n4  It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or \nfraudulent statement or representation, or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the \njurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. See Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 527.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that none apply. Applicant\u2019s \nillegal use of marijuana and falsification are recent. Furthermore, for the same reasons \narticulated in the discussion of AG \u00b6 17 (pp. 6-7, supra), incorporated herein, I find his \nevidence is not sufficient to show successful rehabilitation or mitigation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment for two government contractor weighs in his \nfavor. I particularly note Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s strong favorable testimony. Applicant \nexpressed remorse, stated that he has learned his lesson, and has matured since 2006. \nThese factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. Other factors \ntend to mitigate concerns such as his counseling, character, reputation, and job \nperformance. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is substantial. Factors that \nweigh against mitigation include: the nature and seriousness of the offense, his age and \neducation, his employment as a security guard, and his possession of a security \nclearance at the time he used marijuana and falsified his security clearance application. \nApplicant was well aware of the illegality of using marijuana and the adverse legal \nconsequences for his actions. Notwithstanding his possession of a security clearance \nand his job as a security officer, he used marijuana and then lied about it on his security \nclearance application and subsequently to a government investigator. Applicant knew or \nshould have known the importance of the trust placed on him by the Government. \nNotwithstanding, he failed to be candid and honest on his security clearance application \nand subsequently to his employer and to a government investigator.  \n \n \n \nMoreover, Applicant continues to associate with persons involved in the illegal \nuse of drugs. Applicant has failed to change his behavior and did not take positive \naction to reduce any possible vulnerability to exploitation. His continued association with \npersons involved in criminal activity casts doubt about Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to personal conduct and criminal conduct.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The\n1\nadverse impact of a clearance decision on an applicant is not relevant or material to an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-21012 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2005).\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 7, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference),\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On April 15, 2008, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guidelines F and E is sustainable.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s adverse\nclearance decision.\nWith respect to the Guideline E allegation, the Judge found that Applicant had deliberately\nfalsified his security clearance application (SCA) when in response to the questions as to whether\nhe had been over 90 days delinquent and over 180 days delinquent on any debts, he answered \u201cno.\u201d\nIn his appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse finding is not sustainable because the\ngovernment did not produce evidence to establish that the unpaid debts were delinquent for more\nthan 90 or 180 days.  In the alternative, he argues that the Judge erred, as a matter of law, by not\nfavorably applying any mitigating conditions and whole-person factors because his falsification was\nan isolated incident and he had subsequently provided the correct information.\nWith respect to the Guideline F allegations, the Judge found Applicant had two debts in the\namount of $6,542 and $4,961 which had been placed for collection.  In 2004, Applicant had made\nan agreement with a credit consolidation company (CCC) to resolve the debts, and had made\nmonthly payments toward the agreement in 2004 and 2005.  However, at the time the case was\nsubmitted for decision, the debts were still substantially unpaid, and Applicant had offered no proof\nof any payments to the CCC in the last two years.  Additionally, there was no evidence that the CCC\nhad negotiated with Applicant\u2019s two creditors in good-faith or had in fact paid the creditors anything.\nIn his appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge erred, as a matter of law, by not favorably applying\nany mitigating conditions and whole-person factors because his indebtedness was an isolated\nincident that had resulted from a loss of employment, and he had established a repayment plan\nsufficient to show that the problem is under control.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guidelines F and E is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted without explanation to the falsification of his SCA as\nalleged in SOR paragraph 4(b).  That admission relieved the government of presenting evidence to\n\n3\nestablish the facts alleged therein.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  As a result, the burden shifted to\nApplicant to present evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts he had admitted, and\nhe had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record.  As a result,\nthe Judge did not have an opportunity to question him about the SOR allegations and evaluate his\ncredibility in the context of a hearing. The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor\nof Applicant under Guidelines C and B.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and E.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nrecord evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 15, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (e-QIP \nversion) (hereinafter SF 86) (Item 4). On February 7, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guidelines C (Foreign Preference), B (Foreign Influence), F (Financial \n \n1Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Feb. 7, 2008). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nApril 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nConsiderations), and E (Personal Conduct).2 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM), dated March 7, 2008, was provided to him, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.4 On March 27, 2008, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on April 2, 2008, and \ntransferred to me on April 11, 2008. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in the FORM \nconcerning the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FORM at pages 5-8) and supporting \ndocuments to show detail and context for the facts in the FORM (Items 9-12\u2014listed in \nFORM at 2). Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice.   \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings, is to accorded to facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing \nfifteen types of facts for administrative notice). In addition to the facts outlined in the \nFORM at 5-8, I have taken administrative notice of facts in Items 9-12. See the Nigeria \nsection of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra. \n \nDepartment Counsel requested amendment of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.b, changing the \ndate of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application from March 14, 2006, to March 15, \n2006 to conform with Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (FORM at 4 n. 7). \nApplicant did not object to the amendment, and it is granted. \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued after \nSep. 1, 2006. \n \n3Item 3 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR).   \n \n4The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated Aug. 30, 2007; \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated October 5, 2007. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he \nhad 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nFindings of Fact5 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in his response to the SOR (Item 3), his \nresponse to interrogatories (Item 5), and his FORM response (FR). All of these \ndocuments included Applicant\u2019s explanations about why he believed the security \nconcerns were mitigated. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \nApplicant has never married (Item 4). He has not served in the United States or \nNigerian military (Item 4). He was born in Nigeria 32 years ago (FR at 2). His parents \nbrought him to the United States when he was four years old (FR at 2). He became a \nU.S. citizen on November 30, 1995 (FR at 2, 17). He attended U.S. schools for his \neducation, completing a Masters of Science in Information Management (FR at 2). He \nworked for defense contractors for seven years (FR at 2). Applicant is active in his \nchurch (FR at 3-4).  \n \nOn March 7, 2008, Applicant received notification that he will be laid off from his \nemployment effective March 21, 2008 (Item 3 at 29).  The loss of employment is due to \na government stop work order on a project, and Applicant\u2019s inability to maintain his \nclearance (Item 3 at 29).  His \u201ctermination is classified as a Reduction-In-Force (RIF)\u201d \n(Item 3 at 29). A fax to Department Counsel asks for expeditious processing of his \nsecurity clearance, and requests that the RIF notice be added to his file (Item 3 at 28).  \n \nForeign Preference (Guideline C)6    \nApplicant asked his aunt living in Nigeria to apply for a passport for him because \nhe believed travel would be more convenient if he had a United States passport and a \nNigerian passport (Item 3 at 1, 4-5, 19, 24-28). His aunt applied for and Nigeria \napproved a passport for Applicant on January 22, 2003, which was after he became a \nU.S. citizen on November 30, 1995 (FR at 8-10). His aunt provided an affidavit that she \nkept Applicant\u2019s Nigerian passport and she never gave his Nigerian passport to him (FR \nat 9). As of November 2007, he indicated he did not have the Nigerian passport that his \naunt received (Item 5 at 8-9, 48). On January 9, 2008, he requested that the U.S. \nConsulate General in Nigeria immediately destroy his Nigerian passport (FR at 16). His \nNigerian passport expired on January 21, 2008 (FR at 9). \n \nForeign Influence (Guideline B) \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt is a citizen and resident of Nigeria.  She is a teacher (Item 5 at \n50). He communicates with her once or twice a year (Item 5 at 50). She has not made \nany requests for information concerning his Department of Defense-related employment \n(Item 5 at 51).  \n \n5 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect \nApplicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.  \n \n6 Applicant provided a copy of his Nigerian passport, which expired on July 15, 1988 (Item 5 at 4-7).   \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \n \nApplicant traveled to Nigeria on December 22, 2002, and stayed in Nigeria until \nJanuary 19, 2003 (Item 3, FR at 15).  He went to Nigeria to clear his head because he \nhad recently been laid off from his employment (FR at 3). This trip allowed him to \nreconnect with his roots and visit his aunt.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and two cousins are U.S. \ncitizens, and all reside in the United States (FR at 4, 20). His mother is also a citizen of \nNigeria (Item 5 at 29). \n \nNigeria7 \n \nNigeria is a federal republic that gained independence from Britain in 1960.  \nNigeria suffers from political instability, economic crisis, ethnic and religious conflict, \nextreme poverty, lack of law and order, judicial corruption and a history of military \ncoups. The military has ruled Nigeria for 28 of its 43 years since independence. In May \n1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule. Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, and conflict \nresults from perceptions of uneven and/or unfair distribution of oil revenue.  Lawless \nelements have engaged in kidnapping for ransom in the Niger Delta area. Heavily \narmed rival militias engage in conflict. The Nigerian government has committed human \nrights violations, and security forces have committed politically motivated, extrajudicial \nkillings as well as torture and arbitrary arrest.     \n \nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) \n \nApplicant was unemployed from about April to December 2003 (Item 5 at 30), or \npossibly from August 2002 to September 2003 (Item 5 at 51). He fell behind on two \naccounts (Item 5 at 30). He was also unemployed from April 2005 to June 2005 (Item 5 \nat 51).  \n \nTwo debts were placed for collection in the amounts of $6,542 and $4,961\u2019s. On \nJune 9, 2004, Applicant made an agreement with a credit consolidation company (CCC) \nto resolve his debts (FR at 29-30). His first 13 payments were for a service fee of \n$1,387 (Item 5 at 55). He made eight monthly payments of either $83.22 or $184.94 in \n2004 to CCC (FR. at 29-31). He made monthly payments of $83.22 the first seven \nmonths of 2005 (FR at 29-31). CCC indicated a belief that these two debts could be \nsettled for 40% of face value (Item 5 at 57). \n \nOn December 6, 2006, he wrote the two creditors asking for a settlement amount \n(FR at 36-39). He offered to pay one creditor $1000 initially and then to make $250 \nmonthly payments (FR at 37). He became aware of the security significance of his two \ndelinquent debts when an OPM investigator interviewed him on July 12, 2007 (Item 5 at \n50).  A letter dated March 18, 2008, from CCC indicated he paid all CCC\u2019s fees on time \n(FR at 27). CCC\u2019s letter did not describe any payments Applicant made after 2005, or \nindicate CCC had paid the two creditors anything. \n \n \n7The FORM at 5-8 is the primary source for the facts in this section.   \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant\u2019s annual gross salary is $88,932 (FR at 45). His payments are current \non his mortgage, and he paid off his car (FR at 5, 40-43). He has also been making \npayments on his student loan of about $5,000 (FR at 59). His gross pay for the two \nweeks from March 1-14, 2008, is $3,420; and his net pay is $2,411 (FR at 58). His \ncontractor\u2019s account statement of February 11, 2008, indicates he had $9,977 in a 401K \nand $5,559 in a loan balance (Item 3 at 21; FR at 56). Another savings account \nstatement of January 31, 2008, indicated a balance of $2,779 (FR at 52). His money \nmarket/stock statement of January 31, 2008, indicated a balance of $2,576 (FR at 54).   \n \nA credit report dated March 4, 2008, lists one of the two debts described \npreviously as currently delinquent (Item 6 at 1, 5). In response to the FORM, Applicant \ngave the status of the two debts as follows: \n \n. . . [CCC\u2019s] method of operations requires the client to not contact the \ncreditors personally, transfer any future correspondence to their company, \nand save as much as possible towards the negotiation of satisfying the \ncredit card debt (see RFM-A). I complied and have to date saved enough \nmoney for [CCC] to conduct its negotiations (see RFM-G). In addition my \ncurrent salary allows me to continually fund these accounts for the \npurpose of paying off the debt accordingly. [CCC] [a]ssured me that the \nmatters are still pending and that I should be patient. At this point, I \nbelieve contacting the creditors directly may compromise the work that I \nhave paid [CCC] to do. I am not in the habit of accumulating debt nor do I \nenjoy maintaining debt as well. \n \nFR at 3.  On February 28, 2008, Applicant said he has the means to pay the two debts, \nand provided proof of payments to CCC in 2004 and 2005 (Item 3 at 20-23). Applicant \ndid not provide proof of any payments to CCC in at least two years. There is no \nevidence that CCC has negotiated in good faith with Applicant\u2019s two creditors or paid \nthe two creditors anything.  \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n    \n \nApplicant\u2019s SF 86, executed on March 14, 2006, asked two questions that are \nrelevant to the issue of whether Applicant falsified his SF 86: \n \nSection 17. Your Foreign Activities .  .  .  d. In the last 7 years, have you \nhad an active passport that was issued by a foreign government? \n \nSection 28. Your Financial Delinquencies a. Fin the last 7 years, have \nyou been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)? b. Are you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debts?  \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to these questions. On January 8, 2008, \nhe explained why he did not disclose the requested information for Section 17, \u201cI did not \nhave [my Nigerian passport] in my possession at that time. It was with my aunty in \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nLagos, Nigeria.  So I did not believe that it was crucial to the investigation.\u201d (Item 3 at 3). \nFor his negative response to Section 28, he explained:   \n \nWhen I was asked to list my delinquent debts on the [security clearance \napplication], I didn\u2019t realize in government everyone is responsible for \ndivulging their financial status to this extent. Since I am in the process of \nrectifying the situation, it did not appear to me to relay (sic) all of the \ndetails concerning this issue. \n \nItem 5 at 30.    \n  \nEmployee Performance  \n \nApplicant worked for his current employer for two years.  He received two pay \nraises (FR at 44-45). He actively sought further education and improvement of his \ntechnical qualifications (FR at 50). His employee evaluations indicate he exceeds the \ncompany\u2019s objectives (FR at 46, 47, 49). He displayed excellent execution of his duties, \nand met or exceeded all technical goals (FR at 46). He satisfied all team development \nand leadership responsibilities (FR at 49). He is a versatile, diligent and dedicated \nemployee (FR at 51). Applicant is a critical asset to his office (FR at 51).  He \u201cprovides \nexpert-level systems engineering support\u201d to a vital command in the war (FR at 22). He \nis very important for mission accomplishment (FR at 23).  He provided a detailed \nresume of his technical accomplishments and work experience (FR at 18-19).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nare divided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d8 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \n \n8 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n9\u201fThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the security concern about foreign preference, stating, \u201cwhen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d Three conditions under \nAG \u00b6 10 could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to:  (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport; \n \n*  *  * \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n*  *  * \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen by virtue of naturalization in 1995. He \nsubsequently applied for a Nigerian passport, which his aunt received on his behalf. His \nactions to obtain a Nigerian passport show some allegiance to, and an ongoing \nrelationship with Nigeria. Disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), 10(b) and 10(d) \napply. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 11, conditions that could mitigate foreign preference security \nconcerns include: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment.  \nApplicant\u2019s aunt applied for and Nigeria approved a passport for Applicant on \nJanuary 22, 2003, which was after he became a U.S. citizen on November 30, 1995 (FR \nat 8-10). His aunt received Applicant\u2019s Nigerian passport; however, she never gave it to \nApplicant (FR at 9). On January 9, 2008, he requested that the U.S. Consulate General \nin Nigeria immediately destroy his Nigerian passport. His passport expired on January \n21, 2008.  AG \u00b6 11(e) applies and mitigates the Foreign Preference security concerns.  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nApplicant traveled to Nigeria on December 22, 2002, and stayed in Nigeria until \nJanuary 19, 2003. He communicates with his aunt, who is a resident and citizen of \nNigeria, once or twice annually. The mere possession of close family ties with a person \nin a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, \nif only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an Applicant has contacts with that \nrelative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated \nrelationship of Nigeria places a significant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion \non Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with his aunt in Nigeria does not pose \na security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and his family members.10 With its mixed human rights record, and other \npolitical, economic and military problems, it is conceivable that Nigeria would target any \ncitizen in an attempt to gather information from the United States. \n \nWhile there is no evidence that Nigerian intelligence operatives seek classified or \neconomic information from United States\u2019 businesses, Applicant\u2019s connections to his \nNigerian aunt create a potential conflict of interest because his relationship is sufficiently \nclose to raise a security concern about his desire to help his aunt or Nigeria by providing \nsensitive or classified information.    \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nNigerian aunt, his relationship with his Nigerian aunt, and his travel to Nigeria in 2002-\n2003 to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \n \n10 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than \nan applicant with relatives living in Nigeria. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran). See also \nISCR Case No. 06-17164 at 15 (A.J. Oct. 23, 2007) (listing 23 consecutive cases involving U.S. citizens \nwith Iranian connections whose clearances were denied). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply. Because of his limited contact with his aunt, \n\u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof [his aunt] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His infrequent contacts (once or twice a year) \nand not particularly close relationship with his Nigerian aunt have a very low potential of \nforcing him to choose between the United States and the Nigeria. He met his burden of \nshowing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with his Nigerian aunt] could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that his aunt is or has been a \npolitical activist, challenging the policies of the Nigerian Government. There is no \nevidence his aunt currently works or ever worked for the Nigerian Government or \nmilitary or any news media. There is no evidence that terrorists or the Nigerian \nGovernment have approached or threatened Applicant or his aunt for any reason. There \nis no evidence that his aunt living in Nigeria currently engages in activities which would \nbring attention to her or that she or other Nigerian elements are even aware of \nApplicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced possibility that his aunt or Applicant would \nbe targets for coercion or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d His father, mother, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and two cousins are U.S. \ncitizens, and all reside in the United States. However, his mother is also a citizen of \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nNigeria. Applicant was born in Nigeria 32 years ago. His parents brought him to the \nUnited States when he was four years old. He became a U.S. citizen on November 30, \n1995. He attended U.S. schools for his education, completing a Masters of Science in \nInformation Management. He worked for defense contractors for seven years.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because he has no interest in property in Nigeria and \nhe has significant U.S. property and assets. These mitigating conditions taken together \nare sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his \ninterview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR \nresponse, his response to interrogatories, and his FORM response. Throughout this \nprocess, he had admitted responsibility for two delinquent debts, totaling about $9,000. \nThese two debts are currently delinquent. He has provided insufficient documentation to \nshow significant progress resolving these two debts. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant was unemployed from about April to December 2003, or possibly from \nAugust 2002 to September 2003. He fell behind on two accounts. He was also \nunemployed from April 2005 to June 2005. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply \nbecause he did not act responsibly after he became fully employed to resolve the two \ndelinquent debts, totaling about $9,000. He admitted he had sufficient funds to pay \nthese two delinquent debts. \n  \nApplicant started to address his two delinquent debts in June 2004 when he \nreached an agreement with CCC to resolve the two debts. He made payments to CCC in \n2004 and 2005, but there is no evidence CCC passed any of Applicant\u2019s payments to the \ncreditors. Applicant was well aware that no settlement was ever reached with his \ncreditors. He became aware of the security significance of his two delinquent debts when \nan OPM investigator interviewed him on July 12, 2007. The importance of resolving his \ntwo delinquent debts was reinforced when he received the SOR on February 7, 2008.  \nHowever, he did not provide evidence that he did anything beyond checking on the status \nof his account with CCC. \n \nApplicant did not provide correspondence with his two creditors disputing the two \ndelinquent debts. He did not establish that he made a good faith effort to repay the two \ndelinquent debts, or show sufficient conditions beyond his control or mitigating \ncircumstances to mitigate security concerns. His financial problems are continuing and \nlikely to recur. He should have been more diligent and made greater efforts to resolve his \ntwo delinquent debts. He has not carried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. \nThere are not clear indications his two delinquent debts are being resolved. His overall \nconduct with the two creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment, and I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 SF 86 asked, \u201cSection 17. Your Foreign Activities .  .  .  d. In \nthe last 7 years, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign \ngovernment?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Technically, he never had the Nigerian passport \nbecause his aunt always retained it.  He did not provide a deliberately false answer to \nSection 17.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 SF asked, \u201cSection 28. Your Financial Delinquencies a. In \nthe last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)? b. Are you \ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?\u201d  Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to Section \n28. For his negative response to Section 28, he explained, \u201cWhen I was asked to list my \ndelinquent debts on the [security clearance application], .  .  . [s]ince I am in the process \nof rectifying the situation, it did not appear to me to relay (sic) all of the details \nconcerning this issue.\u201d  I conclude he deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his \nSF 86 on March 15, 2006, is recent. He did not promptly inform the government of the \nfalsification. He did not receive counseling designed to improve his conduct. No one \nadvised him to falsify his SF 86. He admitted the false statement at issue, and the \nfalsification of his SF 86 is substantiated. The falsification of his 2006 SF 86 casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) The \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) The presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Nigeria must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Nigeria, as well as the dangers existing in Nigeria.11 While there \nis no evidence Nigeria is a known collector of U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic \ninformation, Nigeria has very serious economic, military, political, judicial/legal and \nsocial problems.  \n \nApplicant traveled to Nigeria on just one occasion more than five years ago. His \nties to his aunt living in Nigeria with whom he has communications once or twice a year \nestablish at least a minimal level of ties of affection to her. There is a very slight \npossibility that Applicant could be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe United States.  \n \nApplicant was born in Nigeria 32 years ago, and has lived in the United States \nthe last 28 years. He became a U.S. citizen on November 30, 1995. He attended U.S. \nschools for his education, completing a Masters of Science in Information Management. \nHis father, mother, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and two cousins are U.S. citizens, and all \nreside in the United States. His mother is also a citizen of Nigeria. He worked for \ngovernment contractors for seven years. His performance evaluations, and letters laud \nhis hard work, dedication and contributions to the contractor and the Department of \nDefense.  He is active in his church.  \n \nApplicant requested a Nigerian passport after he became a U.S. citizen. His aunt \nreceived it at his request and held it for him, creating a de facto agency relationship. He \nnever physically possessed his Nigerian passport. He asked the embassy to revoke it. It \nhas now expired. After weighing the evidence of his connections to Nigeria and to the \nUnited States, and all the facts in this decision, I conclude Applicant has carried his \nburden of mitigating the foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns. \n \nApplicant was unemployed from almost a year in the 2002 to 2003 time period. \nHe fell behind on two accounts, totaling about $9,000. He was also unemployed from \nApril 2005 to June 2005.  He started to address his two large delinquent debts in June \n2004 when he reached an agreement with CCC to resolve the debts. He made \npayments to CCC in 2004 and 2005, but there is no evidence CCC passed any of \nApplicant\u2019s payments to the creditors. Applicant was well aware that no settlement was \never reached with his creditors. He did not provide evidence that he did anything \nbeyond checking on the status of his account with CCC. He did not act responsibly after \nhe became fully employed to resolve the two delinquent debts. He admitted he had \nsufficient funds to pay these two debts.   \n \n                                                          \n11 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his 2006 security \nclearance application. This recent falsification has a serious negative impact on my \nsecurity clearance determination because it damages his integrity and trustworthiness. \nEven if he had paid his two delinquent debts after receiving his SOR, I would still deny \nhis security clearance for falsifying his 2006 security clearance application.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, especially his contributions to his employer, \nand my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n12See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in her response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 2), are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant is a 24-year-old human resource representative and analyst assistant for a defense contractor supporting a major command staff overseas. She has worked for her present employer for about a year and a half, and worked as an administrative assistant for another contractor supporting a different part of that command staff for two years preceding that.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: J. Byron Holcomb, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant used cannabis with an older boyfriend during her late teenage years.\nWhen completing her security clearance application, her father, a career military\nintelligence professional, advised her to deny drug use based on her statement to him\nthat she had tried marijuana a few times years earlier. She thereafter honestly admitted\nher use during the security clearance investigation, and there was no other evidence of\nit. She persuasively established her intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, and to\nhonestly report security-related matters. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on June 20, 2007. On December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nJune 29, 2009\n\n2\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (AR) on January 7, 2009, and requested\na determination be made without a hearing. After receiving the resulting File of Relevant\nMaterials for review and comment, she retained her above-listed counsel, who entered\nan appearance and requested a hearing before an administrative judge on her behalf on\nFebruary 26, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 12, 2009, and\nthe case was assigned to me on March 24, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on\nthat same date setting the hearing for April 8, 2009. On March 27, 2009, I granted\nApplicant\u2019s continuance request, which Department Counsel did not oppose, due to\noperational commitments and travel issues. DOHA issued an Amended Notice of\nHearing on March 30, 2009, and I convened the hearing as rescheduled on April 22,\n2009. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without\nobjection. The Government also requested that I take administrative notice of the facts\nthat marijuana and hashish are controlled substances, providing hearing exhibits (HE)\nII, III, and IV in support. Applicant had no objection, except to the relevance of AE IV,\nand administrative notice was taken of those facts. Applicant and her father testified on\nher behalf, and she submitted exhibits (AE) A through G, which were admitted without\nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until April 29, 2009, to\npermit submission of additional evidence. On April 28, 2009, Applicant and her counsel\nsubmitted the additional evidence, which was forwarded to me on April 30, 2009, by\nDepartment Counsel without objection to its consideration. The evidence was marked\nAE H, admitted, and the record was closed. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on May 1, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the truth of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a,\nwith some clarifications, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.b. Applicant\u2019s admissions,\nincluding those contained in her response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 2), are\nincorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old human resource representative and analyst assistant\nfor a defense contractor supporting a major command staff overseas. She has worked\nfor her present employer for about a year and a half, and worked as an administrative\nassistant for another contractor supporting a different part of that command staff for two\nyears preceding that. While working for her former company in 2006, she applied for\nand was granted a Secret clearance, which is also required for her present duties. She\nlater submitted the e-QIP currently pending adjudication when her former employer\nsought to upgrade her clearance to Top Secret so she could assume additional duties. It\nis not clear from the record whether her new position requires the higher clearance, but\nthe information resulting in the present SOR was generated in connection with the\nsecond Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation. (GE 1, GE 2,\nAE C.)\n\n3\nApplicant was born in the United States, but shortly thereafter moved with her\nparents, in connection with her father\u2019s military service, to the country where she\npresently lives. He is a military intelligence professional, who was stationed in that\ncountry throughout most of his active duty career and his subsequent Civil Service\nemployment performing related functions. She attended DoD schools there through high\nschool, and also took some college classes after graduating. Due to a series of\ncircumstances beyond her control, she was taunted and teased by a number of her high\nschool contemporaries and had a difficult social life. During the summer of 2002, when\nshe was 17, she became involved with her first boyfriend, an older son of a senior\nofficer on the base where she lived when he came home from college. Unknown to\neither of their parents, he was a regular cannabis user, either marijuana or hashish or\nboth. Applicant smoked cannabis with him a few times during that summer, before he\nreturned to the U.S. for college. She had previously taken one \u201chit\u201d from a cigarette\noffered by a friend who told her it was \u201chash\u201d in 2000. Applicant insists that she did not,\nand still does not know the difference between hashish and marijuana, and used the\nterms interchangeably. I use the term cannabis to describe her use of one or both\nsubstances, which I administratively notice are identified and listed in the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970. She only smoked cannabis when she was with this boyfriend.\nShe smoked cannabis with him from 6 to 12 times during a two-week trip they took\ntogether in the U.S. in May and June 2003. The following summer, 2004, the two of\nthem traveled around a four-state area together for about two months after she went to\nsee him for what was supposed to be a ten-day visit to his family. During that trip, they\nboth smoked cannabis between three to seven days a week, multiple times a day.\nWhen she returned home from this trip, she had broken up with this boyfriend and never\nsaw him again. (GE 2 at 13-14; AE E; AE F; Tr. at 119-123, 154-156, 158-165, 178-\n184.)\nIn June 2007, shortly after she submitted her most recent e-QIP, Applicant saw a\nfriend who she had not seen in a while in a bar. He went outside to the deck and was\nsmoking what appeared to be a tobacco cigarette when she approached him. She\nasked him for a \u201cdrag\u201d and he gave her the cigarette. When she took the \u201cdrag,\u201d she\nrealized that is was not tobacco, and became upset because she had determined never\nto use drugs again after her experience in the summer of 2004. She reported her anger\nto another friend, who took her home. She suspected that the cigarette contained\ncannabis, but was not positive. (GE 2 at 14; AR at 1; AE B; Tr. at 93-103.)\nApplicant asked her father to assist her with completing her e-QIP due to his\nmany years of experience with security matters and senior position. When they came to\nthe question about drug use, she did not tell him about the extent of her prior cannabis\nuse because she did not want to disappoint him or further irritate him about her\nrelationship with her first boyfriend that had ended with her father angry about the\nextended visit. She merely told him she had experimented with marijuana a few times.\nHe told her that because she was not a drug user and was not addicted to anything she\nshould just put \u201cNo\u201d as her answer concerning past drug use, which she did. (AR at 1;\nGE 2 at 14; Tr. at 83, 157-158.)\n\n4\nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on September 26, 2007.\nWhen asked about drugs, she \u201cvolunteered\u201d all of the foregoing information about her\nprior drug use because \u201cshe had matured since 2004,\u201d \u201cwanted to do the right thing and\nshe realized that not revealing the whole truth would have been wrong.\u201d She further said\nthat she \u201cdid not completely understand the process and now wanted to take the\nopportunity to be completely honest.\u201d The investigator had no prior knowledge about\nany of this drug use, and there is no evidence of it except for Applicant\u2019s initial\nadmissions to the investigator and subsequent confirmations of those admissions. (GE\n2 at 11-15; Tr. at 90-92.) \nApplicant has ended her association with anyone involved with marijuana use or\nany other illegal drugs. Except for the use described above, she has never possessed\ncannabis, nor has she ever purchased or manufactured any drug. She recently married\na non-commissioned officer on active duty who holds a Top Secret security clearance.\nHe attested that she has no recent drug involvement whatsoever, and exhibits no desire\nto do so. Applicant\u2019s supervisor stated that she received a sterling recommendation\nfrom her former boss, and had performed excellent work for him. He said, \u201cshe is\ndiligent and totally reliable. She has a no-nonsense, by-the-book approach to her work\nand her handling of classified material. She has earned my complete trust and\nconfidence.\u201d He further said she \u201chas made every effort to \u2018come clean\u2019 about her past.\nShe has learned a lot from her mistakes and has done a phenomenal job turning her life\naround. I have no reservations whatsoever concerning her trustworthiness in matters of\nnational security or personal integrity.\u201d (GE 2 at 14-15; AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; AR at\n2.)\nApplicant submitted a sworn written declaration of her intent never to abuse any\ncontrolled substance in the future, with an agreement to automatic revocation of her\nclearance for any violation. She also underwent an unanticipated urinalysis screening\nshortly before the hearing at her attorney\u2019s request, with fully negative results. She has\nforesworn any future use of controlled substances, and learned hard lessons from her\nyouthful bad judgement. Her father also testified to her great maturation and responsible\nbehavior ever since 2004. (AE G; AE H; AR at 2; Tr. at 168-177.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\n\n5\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of\nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Three disqualifying conditions that are potentially raised by the\nevidence in this case are: \u201c(a) any drug abuse;\u201d \u201c(c) illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia;\u201d and \u201c(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance.\u201d Applicant  abused cannabis one time in 2000, several times in 2002 and\n2003, and regularly over a two-month period in 2004 with her then-boyfriend who\nprovided the drugs and encouraged her participation. This establishes security concerns\n\n6\nunder AG \u00b6 25(a). Her only possession was that necessarily required to use the drugs,\nso no additional security concerns are supported under AG \u00b6 25(c). Finally, her 2007\n\u201cdrag\u201d on a cigarette she suspected contained cannabis was entirely unintentional since\nshe believed it to be a tobacco cigarette and ceased using it as soon as she suspected\notherwise. This would fall under the criminal defense of innocent ingestion, and\ntherefore was not \u201cillegal\u201d drug use while she held a security clearance. Accordingly, AG\n\u00b6 25(g) does not apply.   \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that an applicant could establish in order to mitigate\nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions raised by this record include: \u201c(a) the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and \u201c(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any\ndrugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence; and, (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use during 2000 to 2004 took place while she\nwas young and a student, and most recently occurred almost 5 years ago. She stopped\nafter breaking up with her first boyfriend, who pressured her to use the cannabis, and\nshe successfully held a security clearance and responsible positions for more than three\nyears thereafter. She is now married to an active duty service member with a top-level\nsecurity clearance and neither of them have any interest in drug abuse. She has\ndisassociated from any drug users, and signed a statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation. Applicant met her burden of establishing that\nher drug use occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment (AG \u00b6 26(a)).\nApplicant provided substantial evidence of her intent not to abuse drugs in the future,\nincluding her disassociation from drug-using contacts, her abstinence for almost five\nyears, a recent negative urine screening, and her signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation (AG \u00b6 26(b)). This case did not involve abuse of prescription\ndrugs, nor has any drug treatment program ever been prescribed for her, so neither AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 26 (c) nor (d) apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n7\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The condition raised by the evidence in this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant admittedly falsified her answer concerning prior drug use when completing her\nJune 20, 2007, e-QIP. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under\nAG \u00b6 16(a). Those conditions supported by the evidence in this case are:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n\n8\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant was never confronted with any facts about drug abuse, because the\nOPM investigator had no information concerning her past use. Applicant minimized, but\ndid not entirely conceal, her past use of cannabis when discussing the e-QIP with her\nfather. He is a high ranking, career military intelligence officer who advised her to falsify\nher answer by responding \u201cNo.\u201d Her admitted use was not so substantially greater than\nwhat she admitted to her father at that time to render this advice more her fault than his.\nShe certainly and reasonably considered him to be an authorized person to advise her\nconcerning the security clearance process. When the OPM investigator made her aware\nof the requirement to provide full and truthful information, she did cooperate fully and\ntruthfully. Accordingly, Applicant established mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (b). She\nalso convincingly testified that she now understands the importance of full disclosure\nand honesty in security-related matters, and of honesty with her father, so such\nfalsification is unlikely to recur and no longer casts doubt on her reliability or judgment.\nThis establishes further mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 (c), (d), and (e). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involved relatively minor cannabis abuse with and initiated by a former\nboyfriend about five to seven years ago, and denying it on her e-QIP. She broke off the\n\n9\nrelationship in the summer of 2004, and has never knowingly used drugs since. She is\nnow married to an active duty service member, who holds a top-level security\nclearance. She is highly regarded by her supervisor and senior officials of the major\ncommand staff for whom she has been providing administrative support since February\n2006. She was age 15 to 19 when her drug use occurred, and is now 24 and\nsignificantly more mature. Her e-QIP falsification was more recent, but significantly\ninfluenced by her father\u2019s improper, albeit well-meaning, advice not to report her\nyouthful cannabis use. Her parents, husband, supervisor, and security personnel are\nnow fully informed of her past drug use due to her volunteering of this information in\nconnection with her security clearance investigation, thereby eliminating any\nvulnerability to coercion or duress. There is a minimal likelihood of recurrence of either\ndrug abuse or falsification of security-related information.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. She has fully met her burden to mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from her drug involvement and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on May 11,\n2007. On June 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nNovember 14, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 24, 2008 and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. In her answer she admitted all of the four\nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-d.) relating to relatives in and travel to the Syrian\nArab Republic (Syria).  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 17, 2008.\nI received the case assignment on July 21, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJuly 24, 2008, for a hearing on August 25, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered two exhibits (Exhs 1 and 2) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted two exhibits (Exhs. A and B)\nwhich were admitted without objection. She and one witness testified on her behalf.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September  4, 2008.\nProcedural Rulings\nAdministrative Notice\nThe government requested that administrative notice be taken of ten official U.S.\ngovernment documents relating to Syria and security concerns of the U.S. arising from\nterrorism in the Middle East. With no objection from Applicant, the documents were\naccepted for administrative notice (Exhs. I - X). \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old woman born in Syria. She came to the U.S. in 1993\nwhen she was 20 years old. She has been employed by a defense contractor as a\nsoftware engineer since 2007. Before that she was unemployed raising her family for\nmost of the previous six years after working for an international telephone company in\n2000 and 2001.  She holds a degree in computer science from a U.S. university. She\nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1999. She met her husband in 1989 in Syria when he returned\nhome to Syria from the U.S. to visit his parents. They became engaged and were\nmarried in 1993 before returning to the U.S. to live. Since coming to the U.S. they have\nhad four children ages 3, 5, 12 and 15. \nApplicant has several relatives who are citizens and residents of Syria. They\ninclude both of her parents, her mother-in-law, two brothers and two sisters. Her father\nretired four years ago as a manager for a government import agency. After retirement\nhe works for a printing company to help his younger son pay for his college education.\nHer mother, mother-in-law, and two sisters are full time housewives. The sisters each\nhave children. One brother is an architect with a private firm and the other one is an\naccountant with a private firm. He also does some inspections of banks for the\ngovernment (Tr. 31).\nApplicant traveled to Syria in 1996, in 2001 for five weeks, and in 2006 for six\nweeks.  These three trips over a 16 year period are the only travels outside the U.S. she\nhas taken. She has no plans to visit Syria and will not do so again if she has a security\nclearance. Her mother visited the family in the U.S. twice since 1993. The first time was\n\n3\nin 1998 when she helped care for the two oldest children and again in 2005 when the\nyoungest child was born. Her mother-in-law visited the U.S. once in 1996 but spent\nmost of time with her brother who lives in the U.S. \nApplicant has telephone contact with members of her family every week or two.\nShe does not communicate by e-mail and none of them know of her work or the name\nof her employer.  She does not condone the policies of the Syrian government\nconcerning terrorist activities and has no responsibility for those policies (Tr. 14). \nApplicant does not have a security clearance but desires one so that she can\nincrease the range and responsibility of her work to make a contribution to the U.S.\nnational defense. She expressed knowledge in her testimony of the requirements\nimposed by holding a security clearance and knows that if she is ever approached to do\nanything questionable, she must report it immediately to her security officer. She has\nbeen instructed in the requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations\n(ITAR) (Tr. 34-35). She regards the U.S. as her country and has established a family\nand career in the U.S. She takes great pride in her U.S. citizenship and would not do\nanything to jeopardize the lives of her children. \nApplicant\u2019s husband is now employed by the telephone company that she worked\nfor in 2001-2002. Her annual salary is $68,000, and they have a combined annual\nincome of well over $100,000. Their assets are all in the U.S.\nTestimony was given by the godmother of Applicant\u2019s four children who has been\na friend of the family since Applicant arrived in the U.S. She has found them to be a\ntrustworthy close family and has shared holidays with them. She is a natural born U.S.\ncitizen of a different religion and background but has found the family to be well\nadjusted to the mores and culture of the U.S. (Tr. 17-21). \nApplicant is well regarded by her supervisors at her corporate employer and they\nsupport her application for a security clearance (Exhs. A and B). \nThe Syrian government is an authoritarian regime. It has been identified as one\nof several state sponsors of terrorism by the Department of State (Exh. III). The\ngovernment provides assistance and support to terrorist organizations in Syria and\nLebanon. It has permitted Iran to transfer weapons and supplies through Syria to\nLebanon thus helping to de-stabilize that government including involvement in the\nassassination of its prime minister (Exh. V). It has also served as a transit point for\nforeign fighters entering Iraq (Exh. I). The human rights record in Syria was described\nas \u201cworsened\u201d with detailed accounts of specific violations (Exh. VII).  \nIn 2004, the U.S. Government imposed sanctions on Syria by an Executive Order\nand extended the sanctions in 2008 in response to recent occurrences in Syria that\nwere aimed at de-stabilizing Iraq (Exh. V).\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nlegal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all\nallegations set forth in the SOR: \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism\nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion (AG \u00b6 7(a)). A second condition that\ncould raise a security concern include connections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create potential conflict of interest between the individual\nand desire to help a foreign person by providing information (AG \u00b6 7(b)). \nBased on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of family\nmembers living abroad, the Government established a basis for concern over foreign\ninfluence. The Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence\nwhich refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No.\n99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nMitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual group or government and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6\n8(a)). \nThe fact that some close relatives live in Syria, and the history of that country in\ngiving support of terrorist organizations makes it a heightened security risk. U.S. troops\nare fighting insurgent  forces in Iraq which has a long unguarded border with Syria. Syria\n\n6\nhas sponsored state terrorism in Lebanon and has provided shelter to hostile groups\nwho cross the border into Iraq. While the U.S. Government has attempted to work with\nSyria to eliminate these problems at the border, they still occur and tensions between the\ntwo countries continue. Because of this situation, the MC is not applicable. \nA second possible MC is that because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligations to the foreign persons or country is so minimal, or that she has such deep\nand longstanding relations and loyalties to the US., she can be expected to resolve any\nconflicts in favor of the U.S. interests(AG \u00b6 8(b)). In most situations in the majority of\ncountries in the world, this MC would be applicable in view of the strong ties Applicant\nhas with the U.S. However, the facts relating to Syria\u2019s involvement in terrorist activities,\ncauses me to conclude that it is not applicable.  \nA third possible MC is if the contacts with foreign persons are so infrequent to be\ndeemed casual (AG \u00b6 8(c)). However, by virtue of her close relationships with her foreign\nfamily members, Applicant\u2019s contacts cannot be deemed casual. Also, her contacts are\nrelatively frequent even though she insures that the information she gives them about\nher employment is extremely limited. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct\nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. \nThe security concerns do not arise because of any misconduct by Applicant but\nsolely because of the family members living in a country with security concerns for the\nU.S. While her motivation for seeking a security clearance is commendable, the\ncloseness and number of relatives living in Syria leaves doubts as to the wisdom of\ngranting a clearance in these circumstances. \n\n7\nApplicant gives every indication in her testimony and proffered evidence that she\nis a loyal citizen whose gratitude for her education and career in the U.S. would not likely\nbe compromised. However, most of her extended family lives in a dangerous part of the\nworld where violence and hostile actions have taken place, and will likely continue in the\nnear term. That situation creates an unacceptable risk. Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from these issues of foreign influence.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied.\n \nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 11, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated July 29, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant answered the FORM on August 27, 2008. His \nanswer included a Statement of Intent, dated August 29, 2008, in which Applicant \npromised to abstain from all use of marijuana or any other illegal drugs. The case was \nassigned to me on September 29, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the two SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old computer engineer.3 He attended college from \nSeptember 2002 to March 2007, and earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nengineering. He has been a part-time graduate student in electrical engineering since \nthe fall of 2007. From 2001 to early 2007, Applicant worked part-time as a web \ndeveloper and programmer. In April 2007, he was hired by his current employer, a \ndefense contractor. He has never been married and has no children. He did not serve in \nthe military. While in college during 2003\u20132004, Applicant was convicted twice at a \nmunicipal court for underage consumption of alcohol. He was fined and required to \nperform community service both times. \n \nApplicant started using marijuana in August 2004. He used marijuana \nintermittently until March 2007 (Item 4, section 24). During this period, he used \nmarijuana approximately 30 times in a variety of environments such as in party-like \nsituations and when alone to enhance his senses while listening to music. He \npurchased marijuana from close friends twice, but claimed he has never sold it. He paid \n$45 for one quarter ounce of marijuana on both occasions (Item 6). \n \nApplicant stated he has never used any other illegal drugs. He has never \nreceived any treatment of counseling as a result of his marijuana use (Item 6). His \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3  Items 4 and 5 are the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nparents are aware of his two convictions for underage drinking as well as his use of \nmarijuana. Applicant acknowledged he knew the use of illegal drugs, including \nmarijuana, is inappropriate for a responsible adult, especially for someone with access \nto classified information. He stopped using marijuana in March 2007, and promised \nnever to use illegal drugs again (Items 4 and 6). \n \nApplicant \nwillingly \nused \nmarijuana \nwhen \nthe \nopportunity \narose.4 \nHe \nacknowledged that his decisions to purchase and use marijuana were both illegal and \ndangerous to him, and reflect poor judgment. Applicant justified his past use of \nmarijuana on the fact that he \u201cdisagreed strongly with the prohibition of using [an] \nostensibly harmless drug as marijuana.\u201d He was \u201coperating under the philosophy that \n\u201can unjust law is no law at all.\u201d  \n \nApplicant acknowledged he was wrong in his justification for using marijuana and \nthat he was simply breaking the law. He claimed he now has a different perspective and \nrespect for the law. To show he has matured, he noted he was candid and truthful on \nhis answers to the e-QIP. He disclosed all his past use of marijuana because of his \nbelief in the importance of complete openness in issues pertaining to national security.  \n \nApplicant stated that since March 2007, his personal situation and attitude toward \nthe use of drugs have changed significantly. He noted that since he stopped using \nmarijuana he changed his lifestyle and his environment. He stopped attending college \nparties and meeting with people who use illegal drugs. He explained this was the result \nof his move to another residence (9 miles away from his previous residence) after \nfinishing college and his increased job responsibilities. He \u201cnow believes that using \nmarijuana would be negligent to his present responsibilities, ethically wrong due to the \nbreaking of the law, and dangerous due to the potential consequences (e.g. legal \nrepercussions).\u201d He loves the United States dearly and averred that under no \ncircumstance would he betray his country.  \n \nApplicant stated that after he began his marijuana abstinence, on several \noccasions he has been in an environment in which marijuana was used. He believes \nthat in the future he could find himself in a similar environment when he is around his \nlong-time grade school and college friends. In Applicant\u2019s own words: \n \nAll the people with whom I used to use marijuana and who still use it \nthemselves, are very close friends who I have known either since grade \nschool or for many years since I first came to [city] to attend college. To \nme their marijuana use, though I no longer agree with it, is their choice \nand does not affect on who they are. That being the case, disassociation \nhas not been demonstrated because I am unwilling to end these highly \nvalued friendships for the sole purpose of avoiding potentially negative \nconsequences to my career. Furthermore, for the aforementioned \n \n4  Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is the source for the facts in the following paragraphs unless \notherwise stated. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nreasons, avoidance of these environments and people is unnecessary and \nwould not affect my continued abstinence.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the Form, at 5 and 6. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement). AG \u00b6 24 articulates the government\u2019s security concern: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s frequent use and purchase of marijuana from August 2004 to March \n2007, raised security concerns under AG \u00b6 25(a): \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c): \n\u201cillegal drug possession, including . . . purchase,\u201d apply. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline H Mitigating Conditions (MC) and conclude \nthat none fully apply.7 Considering the record evidence as a whole, I find Applicant\u2019s \n \n6  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n  \n7 AG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (a) the behavior happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) a demonstrated \nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of \nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation; (c) \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nmarijuana use frequent and relatively recent. I also find Applicant failed to establish that \nhis questionable behavior is not likely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant has not used marijuana since March 2007 and promised several times \nnever to used illegal drugs ever again. He even signed a statement agreeing to an \nautomatic revocation of his security clearance for any further illegal use of drugs. \nNotwithstanding, I find Applicant\u2019s promises are not persuasive for several reasons. \nApplicant continues to associate with friends who he knows are long-time marijuana \nusers, and he is not avoiding environments where marijuana is likely to be used.  \n \nAlthough he professed to have rejected marijuana, Applicant has not fully \naccepted the validity of the government\u2019s rationale for prohibiting its use. He considers \nhis friends\u2019 use of marijuana as \u201ctheir choice.\u201d He is unwilling to end his \u201chighly valued \nfriendships\u201d with known illegal drug users for the sole purpose of avoiding potentially \nnegative consequences to his career. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. He presented no \nevidence of drug abuse counseling or attendance in a rehabilitation program. AG \u00b6 \n26(d) does not apply. \n \nApplicant received favorable mitigating credit for not using marijuana since March \n2007 and for signing a statement of intent never to use illegal drugs again. Considering \nthe record evidence as a whole, however, I conclude Applicant=s behavior shows \nquestionable judgment and leaves doubt about Applicant\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nabuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs were \nprescribed, and abuse has since ended; (d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of \nabuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s educational achievements and record of good employment for a \ngovernment contractor weighs in his favor. He promised to abstain from any illegal drug \nuse and has initiated some changes in his lifestyle. These factors show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of frequent illegal drug abuse. Applicant was well aware of the \nillegality of using marijuana and the adverse legal consequences for his actions. \nAlthough he stopped using marijuana in 2007, he continued his association with known \nillegal drug users and frequented environments where the use of illegal drugs was likely. \nHe is unwilling to fully disassociate himself from friends who are illegal drug users. His \nbehavior weighs against finding that he will not use marijuana in the future, that he is \nrehabilitated, and that he has good judgment. In sum, his favorable evidence is not \nadequate to fully resolve the security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has not fully mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug \ninvolvement.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a & 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

MacKinnon, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns raised by \nhis alcohol related incidents and diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on July 2, 2007 (resubmitted on March 31, 2008 (GEs 1 & 2)). On June 20, 2008, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concern under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nNovember 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 8, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2008. The Notice \nof Hearing was issued on September 12, 2008, convening a hearing on October 3, \n2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government presented nine \nexhibits, marked GE 1-9, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 22). Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, and presented one exhibit, marked AE 1, which was \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 8, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, and provided explanations. His admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of \nrecord, including his demeanor, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old logistics and supply analyst working for a Government \ncontractor (Tr. 5). He received his General Equivalency Degree (GED) in 2001. He \nmarried his wife in July 2003 and they were divorced in June 2005. They have a five-\nyear-old son of this marriage. \n \n \n \nFrom August 2003 to September 2006, he served in the U.S. Coast Guard on \nactive duty. He was involved in several alcohol related incidents and placed in an \nalcohol rehabilitation treatment. He was discharged early from his service obligation \nbecause he failed his alcohol rehabilitation program. His service was characterized as \nhonorable.  \n \nApplicant has been working for a defense contractor since May 2007. He \nreceived interim access to classified information at the secret level from January to April \n2008 (Tr. 6, 29). There is no evidence to suggest, and the Government does not allege, \nthat Applicant has ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation. Nor does the record evidence show that Applicant has ever failed to follow \nthe rules and regulations required to protect classified information. \n \nApplicant works for a defense contractor providing training support to deployed \nservice members (Tr. 29-30). Since he was hired, Applicant provided support to 28 \ntraining courses in major U. S. installations and abroad. He has travelled approximately \n180 days in the last 16 months as part of his job. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO) submitted a strong endorsement on \nApplicant\u2019s character and performance (AE 1). For more than a year, he has observed \nApplicant\u2019s performance conducting worldwide logistics shipments for the training of \ndeployed service members. In the COO\u2019s opinion, Applicant is reliable, trustworthy, and \ndependable. He has performed his job well regardless of whether he was called to work \nduring the day or night. He considers Applicant to be a loyal, honest, and mature \nemployee.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol abuse, marked by his involvement in several \nalcohol related incidents. Around August 2005, Applicant sought the assistance of his \nCoast Guard chain of command because he was depressed, abusing alcohol, and \nbelieved he was in a path of self-destruction (Tr. 56). He was referred to an 80-hour \nalcohol education/counseling course. After successful completion of the course, \nApplicant continued to receive treatment for his depression. \n \nIn early 2006, Applicant was depressed and consumed alcohol, even though he \nwas taking anti-depression medication. In April 2006, Applicant was depressed, drank to \nintoxication, and became involved in a physical altercation with his roommate. After \npassing out for a couple of hours, he self-reported the incident to his chain of command \nbelieving he had consumed alcohol and an unknown number of Tylenol pills. His chain \nof command referred him to a psychological evaluation because they believed he may \nhave tried to commit suicide. In April 2006, a Navy counselor, and then a psychiatrist, \ndiagnosed Applicant as suffering from depression and alcohol dependence (GEs 5 & 8). \nHe was not considered suicidal. During the mental evaluation, Applicant admitted to \ndriving while intoxicated (GE 5). Applicant received non-judicial punishment at a \nCaptain\u2019s Mast for charges of drunk and disorderly and disorderly conduct. The charges \nwere related to his physical altercation with his roommate. He was reduced from pay \ngrade E-5 to E-4.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied ever having suicidal ideations (Tr. 57). He self-\nreported his consumption of alcohol and Tylenol to his chain of command because he \nwas concerned he may have taken too many Tylenol while drunk.  \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant attended a barbecue at his girlfriend apartment and \nwas involved in another physical altercation. He also self-reported this incident to his \nchain of command. In August 2006, he was processed for elimination from the service \nbecause he was considered an alcohol rehabilitation failure. His service was \ncharacterized as honorable, and he was barred from re-enlistment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was an alcoholic.2 Applicant started consuming alcohol around \nage 15. During his April 2006 psychological evaluation, he disclosed consuming beer \nfrom age 15 to 17. From age 18 to 21 he consumed approximately 12 beers twice a \nmonth. At age 22, he was consuming 12 beers three to four times a week.  \n \nApplicant explained his depression and alcohol consumption problems were \ncaused by his young age and lack of maturity (Tr. 30-31). He enlisted and moved away \nfrom his home and family for the first time. A couple of months after arriving at his \ntraining station he started to experience depression and sought medical treatment. He \nmarried in 2003, at age 20, because his wife had a baby five months earlier. In 2005, \ntheir marriage was not working and they separated. Applicant did not know how to cope \nwith \u201cthe emptiness of his life,\u201d being separated from his wife, and away from his son. \n \n2  The source for facts on this paragraph is GE 5, unless otherwise stated. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHe became depressed and drank excessively to cope with his loneliness. He realized \nhe was not able to control his depression and drinking and sought counseling. He was \nprescribed anti-depression medication. After his discharge from the Coast Guard, \nApplicant lived with his mother from June 2006 to May 2007. He did not consume \nalcohol during that period.  \n \nApplicant has learned to adjust with the separation from his son. He now looks \nforward to spending time with his son during his visitation periods. He has a good \nrelationship with his ex-wife and her new boyfriend. They live in a different state. He has \na new girlfriend and is considering proposing marriage to her.  \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant provided a statement to a Government investigator \nin which he disclosed his alcohol consumption patterns (Tr. 41, GE 4). Applicant started \nconsuming alcohol again in May 2007. He consumed alcohol with his co-workers, \nusually three beers at happy hours, two to three times a week (GE 4). While at home, \nhe consumed three beers while watching football games, approximately eight times \nduring the football season. During the interview, he became aware of security concerns \nraised by his past alcohol related behavior and his alcohol consumption. After the \ninterview, he stopped consuming alcohol. He intends to abstain from alcohol until he \nreceives his security clearance (Tr. 43, 62-63). He stopped consuming alcohol to \ndemonstrate that alcohol if not important to him (Tr. 65). Applicant believes that his \nability to receive a security clearance is tied to his professional development and to his \nability to earn more money. He does not intend to abuse alcohol ever again (Tr. 78).  \n \nAfter his discharge from the Coast Guard, Applicant did not continue to attend \ntherapy for his depression because he was not longer entitled to health care benefits \nfrom the Coast Guard and he did not have a permanent job. Other than the counseling \nhe received while in the Coast Guard, he has not participated in any further depression \nor alcohol counseling/therapy (Tr. 44). He testified he had not suffered from depression \nsince December 2006 (Tr. 59). \n \nApplicant testified he understands the seriousness of his past behavior and takes \nfull responsibility for his actions. He has made a conscious decision to abstain from \nalcohol because of his concern to keep his job and his ability to have access to \nclassified information. Applicant believes he no longer suffers from depression because \nhe has matured and learned to handle stress without recurring to alcohol (Tr. 51). He \nhas not taken any anti-depression medications since he was discharged from the Coast \nGuard. He noted he has not been involved in any alcohol related problems on or off his \njob. He has learned to control the stress in his life caused by his frequent job related \ntravel, hectic schedule, and many job responsibilities. His informed his supervisors \nabout his past problems with depression and alcohol. He considers himself to be sober, \na great worker and a happy person. \n \nHaving observed closely Applicant\u2019s demeanor, I find his testimony credible. At \nhis hearing, Applicant promptly answered all the questions asked. He was frank, candid, \nand forthcoming in his answers and explained his answers without hesitation. He readily \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nadmitted his bad behavior and apologized for his questionable behavior. Applicant \nexpressed sincere remorse for his actions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), the government\u2019s concern is that \nexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G by showing that from \nAugust 2005 to September 2006, while serving in the Coast Guard, Applicant was \ninvolved in questionable behavior related to his alcohol consumption. He was involved \nin two alcohol related incidents, drove while intoxicated, and was discharged early from \nthe Coast Guard because he was considered an alcohol rehabilitation failure.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s \nexcessive \nalcohol \nconsumption \nresulted \nin \nhis \nexercising \nquestionable judgment. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and suffering from \ndepression. Guideline G disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents \naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, and disturbing the \npeace,\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c): \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(e): \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicense clinical social worker who is staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram,\u201d apply.  \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n(c): the individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and \nrelapse, and is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d): the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find Guideline G \nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 23(a) does not fully applies. Although Applicant started \nconsuming alcohol illegally at age 15, there is no evidence of alcohol related problems \nuntil 2005, when he was 22 years old. His depression and alcohol related problems \nappear to be circumscribed to the period of August 2005 to September 2006, while he \nwas serving in the Coast Guard.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly explained that his questionable behavior happened under \nunusual circumstances. This was his first time away from home. He was young and \nimmature, and did not have the ability to handle the stressors created by his failed \nmarriage and the separation from his son. He did not have many friends in the Coast \nGuard, and relied on his alcohol consumption to cope with his depression.  \n \nThere is no evidence of any further problems associated with his depression or \nany alcohol related problems at work or away from work after September 2006. \nApplicant has been working for his current employer since May 2007. He received a \nstrong endorsement from his supervisor who commended Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and maturity. Applicant has learned to handle his work related stress \nand seems to be doing well. He has a good relationship with his ex-wife, her boyfriend, \nand his son. He looks forward to visiting with his son and making the most of his son-\nand father time. Applicant has a girlfriend and is considering proposing marriage.  \n \nHowever, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and did not make a firm \ncommitment not to consume alcohol in the future. As such, I have lingering doubts \nabout his current reliability and the possibility of recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) partially applies. Applicant has acknowledged his depression and \nalcohol dependence, presented some evidence of actions taken to overcome his \nproblem, and testified he has been abstinent since September 2007. He is remorseful \nfor his behavior, has initiated some changes in his lifestyle, and promises to continue \nmaking changes to ensure his ability to have access to classified information is not \nimpaired.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, I find that AG \u00b6 23(b) \ndoes not fully apply because, not sufficient time has passed for Applicant to establish a \ntrack record of abstinence. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in April 2006. He \nparticipated in some alcohol rehabilitative treatment/counseling while in the Coast \nGuard. However, he was discharged before he completed his counseling/treatment. \nSince then, Applicant has participated in no additional treatment or counseling for either \nhis depression or alcohol dependence. He presented no evidence, other than his \ntestimony, to support his claim that he was abstinent after his discharged from the \nCoast Guard during the period he was living with his mother.  \n \nNotwithstanding the recommendations he receive from the Navy counselors to \nabstain from alcohol, Applicant started consuming alcohol again in May 2007. He \ntestified he stopped consuming alcohol in September 2007, when he was made aware \nof the alcohol consumption security concerns, and that he has been abstinent since \nthen. He presented no evidence, other than his testimony, to support his claim.  \n \nApplicant is fully aware of the security concerns raised by his questionable \nalcohol related behavior. However, Applicant\u2019s testimony implies he plans to be \nabstinent, but only until he receives his security clearance (See Tr. 43, 63). I am not \nsure he understands that because of his alcohol dependency diagnosis, his ability to \nhave access to classified information will depend on his abstinence.  \n \nApplication of AG \u00b6 23(c) and AG \u00b6 23(d) is not supported by the evidence. As \nmentioned above, Applicant is not participating in counseling, treatment program, or \naftercare. Nor is there evidence of a favorable prognosis by a qualified heath care \nprovider.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. He served honorably in the Coast \nGuard for approximately three years. He was discharged early from his service \nobligation because he was an alcohol rehabilitation failure. He has worked for a defense \ncontractor since May 2007, and had an interim access to classified information at the \nsecret level for approximately three months. Except for the SOR allegations, there is no \nother evidence of Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior or, more importantly that he has \never compromised or caused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant self-disclosed to his Coast Guard chain of command he was abusing \nalcohol and two alcohol related incidents that were used to discharge him as a \nrehabilitation failure because he was seeking help. Because of this track record, I \nbelieve Applicant would disclose to his employer any future alcohol related problems. \nHe has stable employment and a strong work ethic. Considering his demeanor and \ntestimony, I believe Applicant has learned from his mistakes.  \n \nApplicant receives favorable credit for his motivation and desire to help deploying \nservice members to complete their training. He is also motivated by the professional \ndevelopment opportunities he would have with a security clearance. After listening to \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and observing his demeanor, I find he has matured during the last \ntwo years and is making some progress in his rehabilitation.  \n \nOn balance, Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol after his diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence, his short period of abstinence, his lack of ongoing counseling, treatment, \nor aftercare, and a favorable prognosis leave doubts about Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation and \nthe likelihood that his questionable behavior will recur.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 21, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.  \n1\nApplicant acknowledges that he has not satisfied his debts.  He asserts that he is a\nresponsible, trustworthy person, and the fact that he has financial problems does not mean that he\nwould compromise classified information.  Applicant maintains that his indebtedness grew out of\nsituations that were not his responsibility, and that he is acting responsibly to correct his debt\ndelinquencies and is making payments to retire his debts.  These assertions do not establish error on\nthe part of the Judge on this record.  Applicant\u2019s brief cites to new evidence which the Board cannot\nconsider.  See, Directive E3.1.29.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She concluded that, notwithstanding the partial applicability of three\nGuideline F Mitigating Conditions, the evidence in mitigation was of insufficient strength to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Specifically, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s recent\nrepayment efforts represent a start, but Applicant has made insufficient progress in light of the\ntotality of his indebtedness. The Judge particularly noted that Applicant has taken no steps to resolve\nnine of his debts.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the record.  The Judge explicitly\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and the health condition of Applicant\u2019s wife.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\n\n3\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

On August 15 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 26, 2008, and September 29, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on October 27, 2008. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2008. \nOn December 3, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nDecember 17, 2008. The case was heard on that date. Appellant did not receive the \nnotice within 15 days as required by the Directive. He waived the 15 day notice \nrequirement. (Tr at 10.) The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as \nJanuary 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant testified and offered nine exhibits which \nwere admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - I. The record was held \nopen until January 9, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  He \ntimely submitted a five page document that was admitted as AE J. The transcript was \nreceived on December 23, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a mail carrier with his \ncompany since October 2006. He has a high school diploma and some college. He is \nmarried and has four children, ages 20, 17, 15, and 11. (Tr at 5-6, 55, 58-59; Gov 1.)  \n \nOn August 31, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance.

In December 2003, he was laid off from a job at a \ntire factory. He had worked for the company for 14 \u00bd years. He was unemployed until \nJuly 2004. He was hired to be a grass cutter. His pay did not match his income from his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprevious job.  In 2006, he was hired by a defense contractor. On June 8, 2006, he was \nlaid off for about a month. He was rehired by the same defense contractor. He worked \nfor about three weeks and was laid off again.  He found a job two weeks later with \nanother defense contractor.  He was hired by his current employer in October 2006. (Tr \nat 22-26, 39-40, 44-45; Gov 1; AE B.) \n \nApplicant has been married for 10 years. His wife is unable to work due to health \nissues. He occasionally helps out his wife\u2019s aunt financially. She has eight children. One \nof the children is getting fitted for braces on his legs. (Tr at 55-57, 59-61.) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant showed that he entered into a debt settlement agreement \nwith a company who specializes in settling debts. The agreement began in August \n2008. He has made five monthly payments so far to the plan, including $650 in service \nfees. Included in the agreement are the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.i. \n(Tr at 27-28, 35, 48, 52-53; AE A; AE E.) Of those debts, he provided proof that the \n$851 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was settled for a lesser amount on December 8, 2008. \n(Tr at 27-29, AE C.)  \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j are medical accounts. Applicant \nbelieves that these debts were for routine medical checkups incurred by his family when \nhe had no health insurance. At hearing, Applicant provided proof that he paid a $115 \nmedical account. It is unclear if this account is connected to any of the medical accounts \nalleged in the SOR. (Tr at 30, 55-57; AE D.)  \n \nHe made no payments towards any of the other debts alleged in the SOR. He \nintends to start paying those debts during the first of the year. He intends to apply his \ntax refunds towards the debts. (Tr at 41, 48-49, 54.) He has attended some financial \ncounseling. (Tr at 47-48; AE J at 1-2.)  \n \nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s home went into foreclosure. He was unable to keep up with \nthe mortgage payments due to his periods of unemployment. The home was sold after \nforeclosure and no balance was owed as a result of the sale. (Tr at 23, 50-51; AE B.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income from his full-time position is $2,740. His wife \nreceives a monthly disability payment of $500. He receives $300 a month from his \nservice as a part-time pastor at his church.  His household total monthly income is \n$3,540.  His expenses include rent $710, renter\u2019s insurance $63, school supplies $140, \nelectricity $210, gas/heating $100, telephone $162, car insurance $175, life insurance \n$29, groceries $400, car payment $304, gasoline $120; personal loan $40; dental $120, \nmedical $14. His monthly expenses total $2,587. He pays a $400 monthly tithe to his \nchurch. (Tr at 57-58, 67; AE H.)  \n \nIn his two responses to the SOR, dated August 26, 2008, and September 29, \n2008, Applicant admitted to falsifying his security clearance questionnaire by omitting \nhis delinquent accounts that were over 180 days delinquent and debts that were over 90 \ndays delinquent. He asked for forgiveness. He stated he was stressed at the time he \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfilled out the security clearance questionnaire. He needs his job and reacted without \nthinking.  He knew that his inability to satisfy debts and meet financial obligations would \ncount against him and he really needed his job in order to support his family. (Answers \nto SOR, dated August 26, 2008, and September 29, 2008.) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he had difficulty understanding the \nsecurity clearance questionnaire. He was stressed out and apologizes for the mistake. \nHe did not intend to omit his delinquent accounts on his security clearance \nquestionnaire.  He knew he had delinquent debts at the time he completed the security \nclearance questionnaire but answered \u201cno\u201d without thinking about it. Upon further \nquestioning, he admitted that he answered \u201cno\u201d because he was concerned about not \ngetting a security clearance and his ability to keep his job without a security clearance. \nHe fully disclosed his delinquent accounts when interviewed by an investigator during \nhis background investigation. He intends to be fully truthful when completing future \nsecurity clearance questionnaires. (Tr at 22, 42, 62-65.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor wrote a letter on his behalf. In 1998, he was assigned to serve \nas Applicant\u2019s mentor when Applicant became a candidate in ministry. Applicant is \ncurrently a licensed local pastor in good standing. Applicant is a trustworthy person, a \nperson of sound integrity, high morals and good conduct. (AE F.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor states that he is a loyal and excellent employee. He works \nwell with others and has a pleasant attitude. He is an outstanding person. (AE I.) Four of \nApplicant\u2019s co-workers prepared a joint statement. They have worked with Applicant \nover the past year and a half. Applicant is a man of good character and good work \nhabits. He is trustworthy and a good family man. (AE G.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has encountered financial \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndifficulty since 2003. The SOR alleged 13 delinquent accounts, an approximate total \nbalance of $14,940. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has had financial problems for the past five years. He did not begin to resolve \nhis delinquent debt until this year. While he entered into a repayment plan to resolve \nfour of his accounts, he has taken no action to resolve nine of the accounts. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues are ongoing.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, due to Applicant\u2019s several lay offs \nover the past five years. In December 2003, he was laid off by a company whom he \nworked for 14\u00bd years. He was unemployed for seven months and has not found a job \nthat matched his previous salary at this company.  In June 2006, he was laid off for a \nmonth, rehired and laid off three weeks later. He was unemployed for two weeks until \nhe found employment with another defense contractor. He is the sole breadwinner of his \nfamily. His wife\u2019s health prevents her from working. He was unable to keep up with the \nbills which resulted in several delinquencies including the foreclosure of his home in \n2007 and an automobile repossession.  However, this mitigating condition is given less \nweight because Applicant waited to address his delinquent accounts even though he \nhas been continuously employed since the fall of 2006.  There were several debts \nalleged in the SOR that were close to or under $200 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.l) \nwhich he should have been able to resolve. For this reason, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given \nless weight. \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies, in part. Applicant has attended financial counseling and is beginning to \ntake steps to resolve his financial situation. However, it will take some time to resolve \nhis financial situation.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \n\n \n7 \n \n \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1,d, 1.e, and 1.i.  He entered into an agreement with a debt settlement company \nin August 2008, in order to resolve these debts. He has made payments to the plan over \nthe past five months. These were his four largest debts. The debt alleged in \u00b6 1.c has \nbeen resolved. However, nine delinquent debts remain unresolved. While Applicant \nintends to resolve these debts in the coming year using his tax return and his income, \nhe has taken no action to resolve these accounts. \n \nWhile Applicant suffered through several periods of unemployment over the past \nfive years and has made some progress in resolving several of his debts, the majority of \nhis delinquent accounts remain unresolved. He has not mitigated the concerns raised \nunder Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his  \nfinancial delinquencies in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on his security \nclearance questionnaire dated August 31, 2007.  \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his judgments and \ndelinquent accounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. Applicant \nadmitted in his answer to the SOR and during the hearing that he did not list his \ndelinquent accounts because he was concerned that his financial situation would effect \nhis ability to granted a security clearance and that he might lose his job. He intentionally \nomitted his delinquent accounts on his security clearance questionnaire. \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country or that is legal in the country but illegal in the United States and \nmay serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \n\n \n8 \n \n \nservice or other group) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s omission of his financial \nproblems on his security clearance questionnaire. His deliberate concealment of his \nfinancial situation created a potential vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern can be mitigated. The following Personal Conduct \nMitigating Conditions (PC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not \napply. Although Applicant states that he discussed his delinquent debts when he was \ninterviewed in conjunction with his background investigation, he did not make a prompt \ngood-faith effort to correct the falsification prior to the interview. His interview occurred \ntwo months after he completed the security clearance questionnaire.    \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) applies.   There is no question that Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification \nof his security clearance questionnaire was serious. Applicants for security clearances \nare expected to be truthful with the government at all times. In his answer to the SOR \nand at hearing Applicant expressed extreme remorse for his omissions and stated that \nhe intends to be completely truthful on future security clearance questionnaires.  He felt \nextreme pressure as the sole breadwinner for his family when completing the security \nclearance questionnaire. While this does not justify his deliberate falsifications, it was \nevident during the hearing that he had learned a lesson from this experience.  His \nsupervisor, co-workers, and pastor attest that he is a man of good character and \ntrustworthiness.  Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission on his security clearance questionnaire \nappears to be an aberration from his usual character. \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) applies.   Applicant subsequently \nfully disclosed his financial situation during his background investigation.  His honest \nadmission that he deliberately omitted his delinquent debts on his security clearance \nquestionnaire shows that he has integrity and is willing to admit his mistakes.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his security clearance questionnaire was \nserious, his subsequent honesty and full disclosure of his financial situation mitigate the \nconcerns raised under personal conduct. The personal conduct concern is found for \nApplicant.  \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n9 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems were affected by his several periods of unemployment within the past \nfive years. I considered that Applicant has taken steps towards resolving his delinquent \naccounts. However, no steps have been taken to resolve nine of the 13 delinquent \naccounts. It is too soon to conclude that his financial issues have been resolved due to \nthe amount of his unresolved delinquent debt. He did not mitigate the concerns raised \nunder financial considerations. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated because \nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance questionnaire, although very serious, \nwas a one-time incident which was a departure from his overall character. His \nsubsequent honesty admitting to the deliberate omissions, his expressed remorse, and \nthe statements from his pastor, supervisor, and co-workers attesting to his character for \ntrustworthiness mitigate the concerns raised under personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was convicted of consensual sodomy.  At\nsentencing, he revealed that he lied.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant regarding the allegations brought under Guideline D and also\n1\nsubparagraph 2.a. of Guideline J.  Those favorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On November\n19, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 17, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness determination.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s adverse\ntrustworthiness determination.  \n1\nSpecifically, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that none of the Guideline J\nmitigating conditions fully apply. \nThe Judge found that Applicant was tried in 2004 for committing forcible sodomy upon a\nminor.  At his trial, Applicant provided false testimony concerning the details and the severity of the\noffense.  Applicant was convicted of consensual sodomy.  At his sentencing proceeding, Applicant\nrevealed that he lied during the trial on the merits.  The court sentenced him to be incarcerated for\n12 months, to two years of post-release supervision, to be registered as a sex offender, and to a\n$2,500 fine.  In 2005, Applicant entered an Alford plea to perjury.  He was sentenced to be\nincarcerated for five years with two and a half years suspended, to run concurrently with his previous\nsentence.  He also received two years of probation.  \nApplicant asserts that trustworthiness concerns have been mitigated because: (i) he was\nsexually abused many times by his older brother during his youth, and this experience made it\ndifficult for him to come to terms with his own acts of sodomy upon a minor; (ii) this difficulty in\ncoming to terms with his past led to his commission of perjury during his trial; (iii) his ultimate\ntruthfulness in fully disclosing his illegal acts is evidence of his rehabilitation; and (iv) his active\nparticipation in therapy and the dedication he has shown toward it establish that four and a half years\nis sufficient time since the offenses to mitigate any trustworthiness concerns.   These assertions do\nnot establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\n\n3\nfavorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence\nas a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He applied applicable mitigating conditions and found in Applicant\u2019s favor\nregarding the allegations under Guideline D and the sodomy conviction under Guideline J.\nHowever, the Judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to mitigate the perjury conviction\nunder Guideline J.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the perjury conviction is sustainable.  The\nJudge  considered Applicant\u2019s past history with his older brother and its effects, his efforts at\nrehabilitation,  and his solid employment record in his whole person analysis.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old (Tr. 7; GE 1). He has an associates degree and has earned several technology certifications (Tr. 7). Applicant met his future spouse in 1995 (Tr. 51), and married her in 1997 (Tr. 51; GE 1).

His felony-level convictions in October 2004 of a crime \nagainst nature (sodomy) and in July 2005 of perjury are too recent and serious. \nApplicant is still on probation and is a registered sexual offender. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \noccupy an ADP I/II/III position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on April \n11, 2007 (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On November 19, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for a public trust position, \nciting trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and J (Criminal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and \nMarch 17, 2009\n\n \n2                                                                                              \n                                           \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.     \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was notarized on December 31, 2008, and it \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on February 2, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February 3, 2009. On \nFebruary 10, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 2, \n2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript \n(Tr.) 17), and Applicant offered 13 exhibits (Tr. 18-21; AE A-M). There were no \nobjections, and I admitted GEs 1-6 (Tr. 17), and AEs A-M (Tr. 21). Additionally, I \nadmitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received \nthe transcript on March 13, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issues1 \n \nThe SOR cited facts that would have brought Applicant\u2019s case under the \nprohibitions of the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986), because he was convicted and \nsentenced to punishments including five years of confinement for perjury. Applicant was \nconfined for more than one year (October 13, 2004, until December 12, 2006) (GE 2 at \n6; GE 3). However, this section of the United States Code, which applied only to \nclearances granted by DoD, was repealed on January 28, 2008, when the President \nsigned the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 into law. It was \nreplaced by adding Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b (the Bond Amendment), which \napplies throughout the Federal Government. Sec. 3002(c) of this new provision \ncontinues the requirement for disqualification, absent a meritorious waiver, for persons \nwho were sentenced to and served imprisonment for more than a year. However, this \ndisqualification only applies to prevent clearances that would provide access to special \naccess programs (SAP), Restricted Data (RD), or any other information commonly \nreferred to as \u201cspecial compartmented information\u201d (SCI). \n \nThis statutory modification ends the former Smith Amendment requirement for a \nmeritorious Secretarial waiver to grant or continue a regular, or \u201ccollateral,\u201d security \nclearance to a person who has received a conviction and served over one year of \nconfinement. On June 20, 2008, prior to the issuance of the SOR and the hearing in this \ncase, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) issued a memorandum providing \ninterim guidance for implementation of the Bond Amendment. This memorandum set \nforth guidance for adjudicators to assess the potential application of the Bond \nAmendment to security clearance determinations and requirements for \u201cException\u201d \nidentification of persons subject to its limitations in the Joint Adjudication Management \nSystem (JAMS) if a collateral clearance is granted. The granting of access to SAP, RD \nor SCI to such individuals requires a meritorious waiver under the terms of that \nmemorandum. Such access is not at issue in this case, and accordingly the Bond \nAmendment was not addressed in either the SOR or at the hearing. \n \n1Administrative Judge White cogently explained the interplay between the Smith Act, the Bond \nAmendment and revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) J in ISCR Case No. 07-11963 (A.J. Aug. 20, 2008). \nI have borrowed freely and extensively without further citation from his explanation in this section.   \n\n \n3                                                                                              \n                                           \nThe repeal of the Smith Amendment also nullified the legal authority by which the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence modified the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) that were approved by the President on December 29, 2005. When the \nUnder Secretary promulgated the AG for use within DoD, on August 30, 2006, he added \nprovisions reflecting the Smith Amendment. AG H (Drug Involvement), AG I \n(Psychological Conditions), and AG J (Criminal Conduct) were each modified, but only \nthe latter guideline is involved in this case. It was modified by adding AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(f), 32(e), \nand footnotes 1 and 2. Because the President, in Executive Order 12968, intended to \nestablish \u201ca uniform Federal personnel security program\u201d (Intro.), and required a \n\u201ccommon set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified \ninformation\u201d (Sec. 3.1(f).), the authority for these DoD modifications to the guidelines \nended with the repeal of the Smith Amendment. The new statutory requirements are in \neffect and must be followed pending formal revision of the AG, but only the prohibition \nagainst granting clearances to unlawful drug users and addicts under AG H applies to \n\u201ccollateral\u201d security clearances. Accordingly, the Smith Amendment-related provisions \nadded to AG J have been repealed, and do not apply to the remaining proceedings in \nthis case.     \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant admitted that he is required to register as a sex offender until \nDecember 30, 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and denied the remaining SOR allegations in whole or \nin part.3 His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old (Tr. 7; GE 1). He has an associates degree and has \nearned several technology certifications (Tr. 7). Applicant met his future spouse in 1995 \n(Tr. 51), and married her in 1997 (Tr. 51; GE 1). Their daughter was born in September \n2002 (Tr. 51; GE 1). He began his employment for a federal contractor in May 2007 (Tr. \n8; GE 1). He has never served in the military (GE 1). He is a senior data base analyst \nand programmer (Tr. 91).   \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n   \n \nIn March 2002, a neighbor, who is a single mother, suggested that Applicant take \nher son on some errands because her son did not have any male influences in his life \n(GE 2 at 3). Applicant formed a friendly relationship with her son, who at that time was a \n15-year-old minor (Tr. 94). Applicant and the minor were together about twice a week, \nwhen they went to the gym or to Lowes (Tr. 95, 97). Applicant claimed the minor \ninitiated several sexual discussions by jokingly raising the issue of masturbation (Tr. \n94). Applicant changed the subject to discourage the sexual conversations (Tr. 98). His \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.   \n \n3Applicant\u2019s SOR response is missing page 1; however, that page only contained his address (Tr. \n13-14). \n\n \n4                                                                                              \n                                           \nmother asked Applicant how to block her son from accessing pornographic websites \nusing the family computer (Tr. 95).  \n \nOn August 27, 2002, Applicant and the minor went to Applicant\u2019s residence (Tr. \n97). Applicant brought up the issue of circumcisions and the minor said he was not \ncircumcised (Tr. 96-97; GE 2 at 4). Applicant asked the minor if he could see the \nminor\u2019s penis (Tr. 97). The minor exposed himself and Applicant committed oral sodomy \non the minor, who was then 15-years old (Tr. 97; GE 4). Applicant denied that he used \nforce in connection with the sodomy (Tr. 109). Applicant\u2019s wife was upstairs when he \nwas committing the sodomy (Tr. 97). Initially Applicant denied that he knew what he had \ndone with the minor was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d asserting that because Applicant was the \nvictim of incest he did not know it was wrong (Tr. 99). He subsequently admitted he \nrealized it was inappropriate at the time he committed the offense (Tr. 100).  \n \nAfter the sodomy, Applicant continued to associate with the victim until March \n2003 (Tr. 100; GE 2 at 4). The victim attempted to extort Applicant into giving him a car \nby threatening to expose the sexual activity (Tr. 101). Applicant claimed he was more \nworried about the incest somehow coming out than what he had done to the minor (Tr. \n101-102). In August 2003, the minor informed the police of Applicant\u2019s misconduct (GE \n2 at 4). \n  \n \nOn October 14, 2004, Applicant was tried for committing forcible sodomy upon \nthe minor (Tr. 104). Applicant testified at the trial that he masturbated the minor with his \nhand, and denied any sodomy (oral penetration of Applicant\u2019s mouth by the minor\u2019s \npenis) (Tr. 103). Applicant knew at the time that he was providing this testimony that it \nwas false (Tr. 104). On October 14, 2004, Applicant was convicted of committing a \ncrime against nature, consensual sodomy (GE 4). At his sentencing proceeding, \nApplicant disclosed his lie on the merits concerning the penetration issue (GE 2 at 5). \nThe court sentenced him to be incarcerated for 12 months, to two years of post-release \nsupervision, to be registered as a sex offender, and to a $2,500 fine (GE 4).  \n \n \nOn May 16, 2007, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator that he lied about the sodomy, \u201cbecause he was fearful of what would \nhappen to his family, losing his wife, not seeing his daughter, losing his job, and not \nproviding any health benefits for his family. [He] also recanted because of his guilt.\u201d (GE \n2 at 5).  \n \n \nOn July 20, 2005, Applicant entered an Alford plea4 to perjury (GE 3, 9). He was \nsentenced to be incarcerated for five years with 2 \u00bd years suspended, to run \nconcurrently with his previous sentence (GE 3, 9). He also received two years of \nprobation (GE 3, 9).   \n   \n \n4Under North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), a judge may announce a finding of guilty, \nwhen a defendant enters a guilty plea and nevertheless makes a protestation of innocence. The \ndefendant must also intelligently conclude that his or her interests require entry of a guilty plea and the \nrecord before the judge must contain strong evidence of actual guilt.  \n \n\n \n5                                                                                              \nApplicant is on probation until December 2009 (Tr. 37). He is not allowed to be \nalone with any minors, including his daughter (Tr. 39). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse, mother and father-in-law, roommates, employer, character \nreferences, and landlord are aware of the convictions (Tr. 106). The conviction was in \nthe newspaper and disclosed at Applicant\u2019s church (Tr. 107).  As a registered, convicted \nsex offender the information about his sexual offense is available on the internet (Tr. \n107). \n  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s information \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse made a lengthy statement on his behalf (Tr. 49-90). When the \nsexual offense occurred, there was considerable stress in Applicant\u2019s marriage because \nhis spouse had two miscarriages and was concerned about her ongoing, difficult \npregnancy (Tr. 51-52). His spouse was also unemployed in 2001 (Tr. 51). Their \nrelationship became distant (Tr. 52). Six days after Applicant committed the sodomy, \ntheir daughter was born (Tr. 52-53). His spouse learned about the offense a year after \nhe committed it, when the police approached him about the crime (Tr. 54, 78). He did \nnot reveal the incest to her until the time of Applicant\u2019s trial (Tr. 54-55). Before he \ncommitted the offenses, she trusted him and considered him a loving, caring person (Tr. \n77). \n \nAfter Applicant was confined, she had to sell their home because she could not \nafford the monthly payments. Moreover, there was tension in their neighborhood \nbecause the victim lived nearby (Tr. 56, 68). Her father, who was a former police officer, \nwas very supportive of Applicant, and he even hired a detective to investigate the \noffense (Tr. 57). Applicant\u2019s probation does not permit him to live in her residence (Tr. \n61). However, he is allowed to visit his daughter and has frequently done so (Tr. 71). \nProbation authorities have approved her as someone who can supervise Applicant\u2019s \nvisits with their daughter (Tr. 74).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was present in court when he committed perjury. She thought he \ncommitted perjury because he was ashamed and did not want to admit the sexual \nconduct in front of ten or twelve children who were present in the courtroom (Tr. 68, 79).  \n \nBefore Applicant obtained employment or a place to live, he informed his \nprospective landlord and employer of his criminal convictions (Tr. 62, 65-66). He was \nopen with family and friends concerning his convictions (Tr. 67). Applicant\u2019s wife \ndepicted Applicant as gentle, loving, caring, nonviolent, and mature (Tr. 58-59). She \ndescribed him as a loving and supportive father and husband (Tr. 59). His therapy has \nincreased his maturity, confidence and trustworthiness (Tr. 59, 70, 89). He is more \nassertive in group therapy and would not submit to coercion (Tr. 89). She did not \nbelieve he would offend in the future because he understood what he did was wrong \nand understood what triggered the offenses (Tr. 74, 80-81). She did not believe he was \nsusceptible to extortion because of the offenses (Tr. 87).   \n \n \n \n\n \n6                                                                                              \n                                           \nOther character evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law has a law enforcement background and has investigated \nsexual crimes as a county police sergeant.5 He was aware of the circumstances \nunderlying Applicant\u2019s convictions. He considers Applicant to be truthful, and \ntrustworthy. Applicant has good judgment.   \n  \nApplicant\u2019s landlord and friend has known him for two years and described him \nas responsible, clean, helpful, and respectful (AE E). He is compliant with the rules of \nhis probation and does not visit alone with minors (AE E). Applicant is a good citizen, \nhas law-abiding character and shows integrity (AE E).  \n \nA retired Army Colonel and West Point graduate, who is a licensed minister, \nprovided an endorsement urging reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation (AE G). In 2004, he met Applicant during a weekly Bible study and they \nbecame friends (AE G). He opined Applicant had changed since 2008 and is now \ntrustworthy, reliable and will comply with the law (AE G). Other friends described \nApplicant as family oriented, a hard worker, trustworthy, with strong integrity (AE H, I, \nK). Others had similar positive comments concerning Applicant\u2019s law-abiding character \nand trustworthiness (AE J, L, M). \n \nTherapy \n \nStarting in the fall of 2003, Applicant has received therapy from Ms. N, a licensed \nclinical social worker in private practice, who specialized in the treatment of adult who \nexperienced trauma in their childhood (Tr. 24-25, 47; AE A). Ms. N has a masters \ndegree in Social Work and a wealth of private practice experience (Tr. 24, 47; AE A). \nApplicant is the only sex offender she is counseling (Tr. 43). Applicant pays for her \ncounseling services (Tr. 43). Applicant received counseling from Ms. N about once a \nmonth, and then after his incarceration ended the meetings increased to once a week, \nuntil spring 2007, when his therapy sessions increased to twice a week (Tr. 26-27, 35).  \n \nMs. N determined Applicant was the victim of incest from his brother, who was \nten years older, beginning when Applicant was six and continuing until he was in his \ntwenties (Tr. 30-31). Applicant said he was sexually abused more than one thousand \ntimes (Tr. 113). Applicant initially viewed the molestation as normal; however, later he \nrecognized the incest was not normal (Tr. 31). The molestation was kept secret from his \nparents while it was happening (Tr. 30-31). Applicant has never confronted his brother; \nhowever, he did confront his mother about the incest (Tr. 36).  Applicant\u2019s family was \nnot supportive and did not attend his trial (Tr. 44-45). \n \nApplicant told Ms. N that he committed oral sodomy on one occasion with a \nyouth as described previously in the Criminal Conduct section of this decision (Tr. 31). \nApplicant thought the sexual activity with the victim was normal at the time he did it (Tr. \n33). During the course of therapy or perhaps when the victim was trying to extort \nApplicant, he recognized it was not normal (Tr. 34). \n \n5Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s written statement is the source for the facts in this paragraph (AE D). \n\n \n7                                                                                              \n                                           \n \nMs. N thought Applicant\u2019s perjury was \u201ca desperate attempt to get himself out of \nthe situation for a number of reasons and one being that he knew that his sexual abuse \nby his brother would become part of the story\u201d (Tr. 41). Applicant scrupulously complies \nwith the rules of his probation (Tr. 46). Ms. N predicted he would be honest about his \nbehavior if questioned in court or a security context because he has learned about the \nconsequences of not being forthright (Tr. 42). \n \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis is 300.4\u2014dysthymia (Tr. 29).6 He also has a moderate \nunderlying depression (Tr. 29). Applicant is now more mature and thoughtful (Tr. 28, \n47). He is not impulsive (Tr. 27). Although Applicant is her only source of information \n(Tr. 39), Ms. N concluded Applicant is dedicated to his employment and therapy (Tr. 27, \n48). He supports his wife and daughter (Tr. 28).  Applicant is a trustworthy person, who \nwill not offend in a similar way in the future (Tr. 29, 48-49).  \n \nApplicant completed the Sex Offender Awareness Program while he was \nincarcerated. He also receives weekly Sex Offender Treatment and counseling from Dr. \nG at a clinical center once a week in group therapy and once a month with his wife (Tr. \n26-27; GE 9). Applicant pays for the therapy with Dr. G (Tr. 73). Applicant eventually \npassed a sexual history polygraph (Tr. 108). In the polygraph, he denied that he used \nforce, that there were other minor victims, that he viewed pornography, and that he was \ncommunicating with minors (Tr. 111). He also passed the polygraph on whether he was \nbeing truthful with his probation officer and therapist (Tr. 111). Applicant expressed \nremorse and was very sorry for what he had done (Tr. 129-130). \n \nOccupational history \n \nApplicant fully disclosed his offenses to employers and on his SF 85P (Tr. 117; \nGE 1; AE B, C). He also disclosed his need to attend therapy and meet other probation \nrequirements (AE B). He is an innovative, diligent, hard-working employee, who often \nearned awards (Tr. 114, 120). Applicant was never unemployed, except while he was \nincarcerated (Tr. 114). Even when he was incarcerated, he taught inmates about \ncomputers and use of Microsoft office applications (Tr. 115). Applicant learned and \nmatured while incarcerated and considered it a positive life experience (Tr. 116).  \n \nApplicant loved his work in information technology, and contributed to his \nemployer\u2019s success (Tr. 116, 119). He showed integrity, professionalism and \ncompetence at work and his employer trusted him with very sensitive, government and \ncontract information (Tr. 120-122; AE B, F). Applicant received respect and praise from \nhis employer for several noteworthy contributions (Tr. 121-123; AE B, C, F). Fellow \nemployees and his supervisor at the contractor believed Applicant was trustworthy and \nhis work performance warranted a public trust position (AE B, C). \n \n \n6 A dysthymic disorder is essentially an emotional depression that persists for years of moderate \nor less than moderate intensity. See the diagnostic criteria for dysthymic disorder in the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Copyright 1994 by the American Psychiatric \nAssociation (available at:  http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dysd.htm). \n\n \n8                                                                                              \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n\n \n9                                                                                              \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance \n[or access to sensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant trustworthiness concern is under Guidelines D (Sexual \nBehavior) and J (Criminal Conduct).   \n \nSexual Behavior, Guideline D \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the concern about sexual behavior stating: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides four conditions relating to sexual behavior that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n\n \n10                                                                                             \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nApplicant admitted that he committed sodomy upon a 15-year-old minor. His \nconduct constitutes a felony. It does not make him vulnerable to coercion because he \nhas been open to his family, employer, landlord, and others about his offense. He is a \nregistered sex offender and his conduct is readily discoverable on the internet. There is \nno pattern of sexual behavior because Applicant committed one offense. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b) \nand 13(c) do not apply; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(d) apply.     \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c) fully applies mitigating the sexual behavior. Applicant\u2019s sexual offense \nis public information. He is a registered sexual offender and the information is available \non the internet. He informed his family, employer and landlord of the sexual behavior. \nAccordingly, the sexual behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation \nor duress.  \n \nThe other three mitigating conditions do not apply. On August 27, 2002, \nApplicant committed the sexual behavior at issue, and at that time he was 32 years old. \nAG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply because he was not an adolescent. The sodomy with a \nminor occurred more than six and a half years ago. He has served his incarceration and \nreceived extensive therapy. However, Applicant described years of incest by his older \nbrother, and he was sexually abused more than 1000 times. Because of this extensive \nhistory of abuse, there is still a possibility of recurrence and AG \u00b6 14(b) can only be \npartially applied. Applicant placed a minor\u2019s penis into his mouth. The minor could not \nlegally consent to the sexual activity and AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. \n \nCriminal Conduct, Guideline J \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n\n \n11                                                                                             \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and \nmay be disqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.  \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(c), and 31(d) apply. Applicant was convicted of two felony-level \noffenses on October 14, 2004 (crime against nature) and July 20, 2005 (perjury). He \nadmitted that he committed the two felonies. He was sentenced to substantial \nincarceration, fines and probation. He remains on probation at this time.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) clearly do not \napply because he admitted the offenses and no one pressured him into committing the \n\n \n12                                                                                             \noffenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are similar and are partially applicable. Applicant's \nmost recent criminal offense occurred on October 14, 2004, about four and a half years \nago. He served his sentence to incarceration and paid his fines. He presented strong \nevidence of remorse, job training, a good employment record and solid support from his \nemployer, counselor, spouse, landlord, friends and father-in-law. A fairly lengthy period \nhas elapsed after his most recent offense, and he has had time to contemplate his poor \njudgment and to respond to therapy.  \n \nThe therapy Applicant received is particularly noteworthy because Ms. N\u2019s \nservices were not court ordered. Applicant paid for Ms. N\u2019s therapy on his own initiative. \nHe also completed the Sex Offender Awareness Program while he was incarcerated. \nHe receives weekly Sex Offender Treatment and counseling from Dr. G at a clinical \ncenter and once a month receives family counseling with his wife (Tr. 26-27; GE 9). His \ntherapy and counseling have had a powerful salutary effect. He understands his \ncriminal offenses had a devastating impact on his lifestyle, family and career. His \ndemonstrated intent not to commit future crimes is encompassed in these two mitigating \nconditions. He has worked with information technology and has a good employment \nrecord. He sincerely accepted responsibility for his misconduct.  \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct cannot be fully mitigated at this time. He \nwas a victim of years of sexual abuse. He was victimized more than 1000 times. The \ndevastating abuse by his brother has increased the risk that Applicant will sexually \nabuse others, or commit other criminal offenses. He is still on probation and more \nprogress is necessary to assure he is reliable, trustworthy and responsible to be given \naccess to sensitive information.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or public trust position by considering the \ntotality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance or public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines D and J in my whole person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some \nwarrant additional comment. \n\n \n13                                                                                             \n                                           \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s sexual offense occurred on August 27, 2002, which is six and a \nhalf years ago. His perjury offense was closely linked to the sodomy, as he committed \nperjury at his trial for committing sodomy upon a minor. He has not committed any \noffenses, since his perjury offense on October 14, 2004. He frankly and candidly \nadmitted his two felonies on his SF 85P, to his employer, to his landlord, to his \ntherapists, to his family, to an OPM investigator, and at his hearing. He knows the \nconsequences of criminal offenses. He completed his incarceration and paid his fines. \nHe has received years of one-on-one expert counseling, group therapy and family \ncounseling, providing important mitigation of his sexual offense. Applicant significantly \ncontributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence at \nwork of any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would \nintentionally violate national security or that he would fail to safeguard sensitive \ninformation. His character and good work performance show substantial responsibility, \nrehabilitation and mitigation. Other contractor employees, his supervisor, friends, family \nmembers and others support his continued access to sensitive information.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant was sexually abused more than 1000 times over more than ten years by his \nolder brother. When he was 32 years old, he sexually abused a minor, sodomizing him \nwhile his wife, who was nine months pregnant, was upstairs. He then continued to \nattempt to manipulate the minor into not reporting the incident, holding out the possibility \nthat Applicant would give the minor a car, when he turned 16. When he went to trial on \nOctober 14, 2004, he committed perjury, and failed to take full responsibility for what he \nhad done. He is currently on probation and is registered as a sex offender. Under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, his two felonies cannot be considered individually, and \nmust be analyzed in combination with each other. His two felonies cannot be mitigated \nat this time. His criminal offenses were knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He \nwas sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. These two crimes show \nan extreme lack of judgment and a failure to abide by the law. Such conduct raises a \nserious trustworthiness concern, and access to sensitive information is not warranted at \nthis time. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to criminal conduct. Sexual behavior is mitigated because it \nis not recent.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n14                                                                                             \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \noccupy an ADP I/II/III position.

In April 2000, Applicant opened a credit card account at a nationally-recognized federal credit union. He did so at the behest of a friend who needed Applicant\u2019s help with his start-up company, and with the help of the friend\u2019s brother, who was in the credit union membership pool.

Applicant answered the SOR on 25 August 2008, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 3 March 2009. The record in this case\nclosed 22 January 2009, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) was due. Applicant did not respond to the FORM.\n \n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the foreign influence allegations of SOR paragraph 1, denied\nthe falsification allegations of paragraph 2 and 3.b., and admitted the financial allegation\nof 1.a. He is a 33-year-old IT project manager employed by a U.S. defense contractor\nlocated in South Korea since January 2007. He has not previously held a clearance.\nIn April 2000, Applicant opened a credit card account at a nationally-recognized\nfederal credit union. He did so at the behest of a friend who needed Applicant\u2019s help\nwith his start-up company, and with the help of the friend\u2019s brother, who was in the\ncredit union membership pool. Applicant opened the account because the friend could\nnot pay Applicant for his work, and Applicant needed a funding source for everyday\nexpenses. Applicant has not explained how or when he expected to be paid for his work\non his friend\u2019s company. Applicant\u2019s clearance application reflects that during the time\nhe was doing consulting work for his friend, he was employed full time by two different\ncompanies, neither of which is his friend\u2019s company. In any event, Applicant used the\ncredit card account for its stated purpose, and for a time was able to keep up with\nminimum payments. However, eventually the payments became too great, and\nApplicant defaulted on the account in September 2003, with an initial delinquent balance\nof over $16,000. The record reflects no extraordinary circumstances contributing to\nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay.\nIn August 2002, Applicant opened a line of credit with the same credit union to\npurchase a condominium. As with the credit card, he made payments for a time, but\ndefaulted in August 2003, with a delinquent balance of nearly $18,000. Applicant\nultimately settled both accounts with a lump-sum payment of $30,000 in April 2008. The\nrecord does not indicate where Applicant got the $30,000 to make the payment.\nApplicant disclosed these two delinquent accounts on an April 2004 clearance\napplication, but falsely asserted that the accounts had been \u201csatisfied\u201d in November\n2003. He disclosed these two delinquent debts on a January 2006 public trust\nquestionnaire, but falsely asserted that the accounts were \u201cresolved\u201d on an unspecified\ndate. He also disclosed these two delinquent accounts on an April 2007 clearance\napplication, but falsely asserted that they had been \u201csatisfied\u201d in April 2007, by which he\nmeant that they were \u201cin the process of being settled.\u201d However, Applicant provided no\ncorroboration of the claimed efforts to contact the credit union during 2007. Nor has he\ncorroborated any of his claimed partial payments. As noted above, Applicant settled the\naccounts in April 2008.\n         Applicant is also alleged to have misrepresented the status of these two\ndelinquent debts during a March 2006 subject interview, during which he is recorded as\nclaiming to have agreed on a settlement figure and made the payment in March 2004.\nAlthough the recorded statement was not true, the investigator notes that Applicant\u2019s\nstatement was an unsworn declaration. Applicant denied misrepresenting the status of\nhis accounts during this interview, and both his December 2004 sworn statement and\n\n3\nhis June 2007 subject interview conducted under oath accurately report the status of\nthose accounts at the time the statements were made.\nApplicant was born in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in September 1975.\nHe immigrated to the U.S. with his parents in 1986. They obtained their green cards but\nreturned to South Korea in 1989, while Applicant remained in the U.S. However,\nApplicant also returned to South Korea in 1994, and attended a South Korean university\nfrom 1995 to 1999. He attended college in South Korea because his father\u2019s employer,\nKorean Airlines, paid his tuition. After college, Applicant returned to the U.S., but not\nbefore he married in May 1999.\nApplicant resides in South Korea with his wife, a resident citizen of South Korea,\nand his children, who are U.S. born citizens. His parents are both resident citizens of\nSouth Korea, who lived with Applicant until recently. They remain legal permanent\nresidents of the U.S. His mother-in-law is also a resident citizen of South Korea. He has\nregular contact with his parents and his mother-in-law.\nApplicant lives in South Korea because he is employed by a company that works\nfor U.S. Forces Korea. He began looking for a jobs with U.S. Forces Korea, in\nDecember 2004, but it was not until December 2006 that he obtained such employment\nand moved to South Korea. Applicant and his wife wanted to live in South Korea so that\nhis parents would be close to their grandchildren.\nApplicant\u2019s father was a pilot for Korean Airlines and Asiana Airlines. He retired\nas pilot in 2004-2005. In December 2004, his father lived with Applicant\u2019s brother in the\nU.S. In March 2006, he lived with Applicant in the U.S. and worked as an advisor for a\nsiding company.\nThe South Korean government has an aggressive, effective intelligence-\ngathering operation that targets economic and proprietary information in the U.S.\nHowever, its human rights practices are generally respectful of democratic institutions. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nB \n(Foreign \nInfluence), \nGuideline \nE (Personal \nConduct), \nand \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n5\n4\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or\n3\nother foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a\nheightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.4\nThe government raised security concerns under Guideline B because of his close\nand continuing contacts with his parents and mother-in-law. The fact that Applicant lives\nin South Korea with his wife and children also raises the potential for foreign influence.\nFinally, his father\u2019s employment with the state-owned airline and his benefitting from\nthat connection with the free tuition, creates a greater possibility that Applicant is known\nto the South Korean government. Although South Korea is not known to specifically\ntarget its citizens to obtain U.S. information, it aggressively pursues such information.5\n\nThe government stated concern because Applicant tried to obtain employment in South Korea with a\n6\ncontractor for U.S. Forces Korea in December 2004, but this fact fails to raise a security concern. Seeking\nemployment in support of U.S. Forces Korea did not expose him to foreign influence by the South Korean\ngovernment . Put another way, if he had never obtained the job he has now, the fact that he had looked for\nsuch a job in the past while remaining in the U.S. would have been of no importance. It is his physical\npresence in South Korea now, not the fact of his seeking or obtaining employment with a U.S. sponsored\nentity, that raises the security concern. Similarly, the status of Applicant\u2019s parents when they were in the U.S.\nin the late 1980s or of his father when in the U.S. in 2004 and 2006 fails to raise a security concern vis-a-vis\nthe South Korean government.\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n7\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan\nto pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . .\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n8\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n9\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n5\nApplicant\u2019s residence in South Korea with his family and his parents puts him in a much\nmore vulnerable position than if he resided outside South Korea. In his current\ncircumstances he presents a potential target of opportunity that presents an\nunacceptable risk of being influenced to provide information. I resolve Guideline B\nagainst Applicant.6\nThe government also raised security concerns under Guideline E. Applicant had\ntwo substantial debts, the status of which he deliberately misstated on three different\nclearance applications. However, the government did not make its case regarding\nApplicant\u2019s unsworn declaration in March 2006. Applicant disputed the contents of that\ndeclaration, which was recorded by the investigator and not certified by Applicant at the\ntime, when DOHA sought to have Applicant adopt the declaration in response to May\n2008 interrogatories. Nevertheless, Applicant falsified multiple clearance applications.\nNone of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct apply. I resolve Guideline E\nagainst Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Opening a credit card account to\nhandle everyday expenses, with no assurances that his friend would be able to pay him\nand with no clear plan for paying the credit card debt is financially irresponsible and\ndisplays poor judgment.  But he also held two full-time jobs while doing the consulting\n7\nwork. He never explained why his full-time jobs failed to provide sufficient income to pay\nthe credit card and line of credit, or indeed, why this income was insufficient to cover his\nliving expenses. His stated reasons for his indebtedness discloses no precipitating\nevent that might excuse or explain his inability to pay.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are recent.  The debts were not due to circumstances beyond his\n8\ncontrol and he has not acted responsibly in addressing his debts.  There is no evidence\n9\n\n\u00b620 (c) person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n10\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n11\n6\nthat he has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.10\nAlthough he settled the debts in April 2008, this does not constitute a timely, good-faith\neffort.  Further, given his unwillingness to seek or use financial counseling, there is\n11\nnothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial problems behind\nhim. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

On February 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. On March 18, 2009, DOHA issued an amended SOR detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and elected to have his case decided\non the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government requested a hearing and the case\nwas assigned to me on June 5, 2009. Applicant and Department Counsel agreed to a\nJuly 8, 2009, hearing date. On June 11, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued\nJuly 22, 2009\n\n2\nscheduling the hearing for July 8, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled.\nDepartment Counsel submitted six exhibits (GE) 1-6, without objection. Applicant\nintroduced two exhibits (AE) A-B, without objection. He testified on his own behalf. The\ntranscript (Tr) was received on July 15, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.h of the SOR. He also admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c of\nthe amended SOR. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1970, and attended a technical school from June 1999 until March 2000.\nHe received a Microsoft certificate in 2000. He is married with one grown son. He has\nworked for his current employer since April 2007 (GE) 1. \nApplicant has worked in the network systems field for many years. He\nacknowledged having a \u201cnational agency clearance\u201d (NAC) in the past but does not\nhave a security clearance at this time. He was unemployed from September 2001 until\nOctober 2003 due to an inability to deal with stress on the job. He was unemployed from\nMarch 2006 until April 2007 because he could not find another contract.\nApplicant attributed his indebtedness to the tragic death of his son in 1999. He\nstated that he did not care about anything. He also believed that the event triggered his\nmedical problems. At the hearing, Applicant testified that his medical problems were the\nresult of stress from his job and thus he could not work for the period from 2001 until\n2003 as a result of the stress (Tr. 29). He received unemployment for the period but no\ndisability income.  \nThe SOR alleges delinquent debts totaling approximately $33,673, including\nstudent loans and two 1999 repossessions. The current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent\ndebts is as follows: Applicant claims he has made two payments of $325 on the $14,023\naccount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He provided one receipt for $325, dated April 2008 (GE)\n4. His credit report confirms the account. This account is for a student loan that\nApplicant obtained in 1999. He presented different reasons for not paying the account.\nHe claimed to have forgotten about the student loan (GE) 2 . \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he has approximately $1,000 to pay on\nsome of his delinquent debt. He will not pay the debts unless he is assured that he will\nkeep his job. He explained that he has not done anything to resolve these debts (Tr.\n26). He claims he has not been able to set up payment plans because the companies or\ncollection agencies will not work with him (Tr. 26). He then stated that he could settle\nbut \u201cit would cost him in taxes\u201d (Tr. 27). In one of his written responses, Applicant stated\n\n3\nthat accounts have been \u2018charge-offs\u2019 and he can no longer do anything with them\u201d. In\nsum, he has not paid any other accounts listed on the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s son and daughter-in-law and four grandchildren live with him. They\ncontribute to the household income. Applicant\u2019s wife does not work because she has\nsome medical problems (Tr. 34). Applicant\u2019s annual salary is approximately $66,000. He\nhas money in his retirement account. His net monthly remainder is approximately\n$1,945 (Tr. 59). Applicant bought a late model vehicle in 2007 and a laptop computer for\nwork. He is paying his car note in a timely manner. He does not use credit cards. He\nhas not obtained financial counseling. \nApplicant completed his September 19, 2007, security clearance application. In\nthat application he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27b concerning repossessions. He also\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 28a and 28b concerning financial delinquencies in the last\nseven years of over 90 or 180 days.\nApplicant claimed to have answered the questions to the best of his ability. In an\nanswer to an interrogatory he stated he was not aware of the student loan. At the\nhearing, Applicant explained that he \u201cwas rushed through the financial section.\u201d He\nfurther explained: \u201cI just ran through it to get it done. I didn\u2019t stop for the financial stuff.\u201d\nHe stated that he tried to retrieve the application to list everything concerning his\nfinances (Tr. 40). He blamed his supervisor for rushing him through the process (Tr. 41).\nHe then testified that if he had filled out the application properly, he would not be\nworking. He admitted at the hearing that he knew that he did not answer the questions\ncorrectly (Tr. 43). He also acknowledged that he had completed a security clearance\napplication prior to the 2007 one (Tr. 61).\nApplicant was not credible at the hearing. He admitted that he did not answer the\nquestions concerning his financial situation correctly. I find that he intentionally omitted\nthe relevant information from his security clearance application. He also was cavalier in\nhis attitude about the delinquent debts and was not credible that he tried at one point to\nestablish a payment plan for the debts.\nAt the hearing, Applicant appeared annoyed that he had to respond to questions\nconcerning the delinquent debts. He did not present any organized information\nconcerning his credit report, although he introduced it as an exhibit.\nApplicant\u2019s manager describes him as a diligent and hard worker. He is reliable\nand trustworthy. As a computer system administrator, he is well respected. He comes in\non time and stays busy (AE) A.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts in a number of accounts. His\ncurrent credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation that he did not know his student loan was on his credit report is not credible.\nHe has not resolved his debts nor does he plan to do so unless he is guaranteed a\nsecurity clearance for his job. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply in this\ncase. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ While the periods of\nunemployment and Applicant\u2019s illness may have contributed to his delinquent debts, he\nhas not acted responsibly under the circumstances. When he began employment in\n2007, he did not address his debts. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has made one or two payments on one large debt.\nHe has not obtained counseling. He has no plan at this time to address his delinquent\n\n6\ndebts. His efforts are insufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these\nmitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2007 security clearance application,\nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 27 and 28. He admitted to the allegations in the SOR\nthat he deliberately failed to disclose material information. He was not credible in his\nexplanation at the hearing that he knew he did not answer the questions properly but\nthat he tried to retrieve the application. I find that he intentionally omitted information\nfrom his security clearance application.\nAfter considering the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of\nthem apply in this case. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\n\n7\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has worked for a number\nof years. He did experience unemployment and illness. However, he has not made\ngood-faith efforts to address his delinquent debts. He was not credible in his testimony\nat the hearing. He deliberately failed to disclose material information on his 2007\nsecurity clearance application.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1 h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Her eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \nOn December 5, 2006, Applicant signed and certified a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF-86). On September 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 7, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. On March 3, 2009, the case was \nassigned to me. I convened a hearing on April 8, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced three exhibits (Ex.), \nwhich were marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. 1 through 3, and admitted to the record without \nobjection. The Government also offered facts in ten official U.S. government documents   \nfor administrative notice. (HE I.) Applicant did not object to administrative notice of facts \nin the Government\u2019s documents. Applicant introduced ten exhibits, which were marked \nas Ex. A through J. Exs. A through H and Ex. J were admitted to the record without \nobjection. Ex. I was admitted conditionally, pending Applicant\u2019s submission of an \nEnglish translation of the document.  Applicant called one witness and testified on her \nown behalf. \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business \nApril 15, 2009, so that Applicant could, if she wished, submit additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted  an English translation of Ex. I and three additional Exhibits, \nwhich were marked Ex. K, Ex. L, and Ex. M and admitted to the record without \nobjection.  On April 21, Applicant submitted an additional document, which was marked \nEx. N and admitted to the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on April 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains one allegation of a security concern under Guideline C, \nForeign Preference (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and four allegations that raise security concerns under \nAG B, Foreign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.d.). In her Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all allegations in the SOR, with explanation. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare admitted herein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and applicable adjudicative guidelines, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old, married, and the mother of two school-aged children.   \nShe is employed as an Arabic linguist by a government contractor. In this capacity, she \nhas worked as a federal contractor since 2006. She seeks a security clearance. (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Algeria. She was educated in French and \nArabic, and she received a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from a university in \nAlgeria.  However, because she was a woman and lacked helpful political connections, \nshe was unable to find employment in her profession. She acquired a job as an \nadministrative assistant with an international company in Algiers and studied English. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter she acquired proficiency in English, she acquired a job with the U.S. Embassy in \nAlgiers, where she worked for about a year. (Ex. 1; Ex. H; Ex. I; Tr.65-68.) \n \n \nWhile she was employed at the Embassy, Applicant met the man who became \nher husband. Applicant and her husband, a U.S. military security guard, were married in \nthe United States in 1998. Applicant\u2019s husband is a native-born U.S. citizen; their two \nchildren are also native-born U.S. citizens. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen \nin 2004. Her husband, now a civilian, is employed in security. (Ex. 1; Ex. A; Tr. 49-50, \n60-62, 70.)   \n \n \nIn 2007, in order to avoid requesting and paying for an Algerian visa when she \ntraveled to Algeria to visit her parents, Applicant renewed her Algerian passport. The \nrenewed passport had an expiration date of 2012. Applicant was not aware that her dual \ncitizenship with Algeria might create security concerns. When she learned of the \ngovernment\u2019s possible security concerns, she surrendered her Algerian passport in \nMarch 2009 to her company\u2019s security specialist, for safekeeping.  On April 15, 2009, \nApplicant requested that the security officer return the passport to her. She then \nsurrendered her passport to a responsible official of the Algerian government, who \nacknowledged receipt of her passport in a written document.  (Ex. A; Ex. K; Ex. L; Ex. \nN; Tr. 80-81.)  \n \n \n \nApplicant is the oldest of six children. Her parents are citizens and residents of \nAlgeria. They were married when Applicant\u2019s mother was 14 years old and her father \nwas 27 years old. Applicant\u2019s father is a retired national police officer, and her mother, \nalso retired, was a homemaker and dressmaker. In 2007, Applicant\u2019s parents were \ndivorced, and her father remarried. Applicant\u2019s step-mother is a homemaker and \napproximately the same age as her mother. (Ex. 1; Tr. 70-72, 92, 95-96.) \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers, both of whom reside in France.  One brother, a dual \ncitizen of Algeria and France, is employed by a technical research organization in \nFrance. Applicant\u2019s other brother, an Algerian citizen, is employed as a physician in \nFrance.  (Ex. 3; Tr. 75-77.) \n \n \nApplicant also has three sisters.  One of her sisters is a dual citizen of the United \nStates and Algeria and resides with her husband and children in the United States. A \nsecond sister is a citizen of Algeria and resides and works in another Middle Eastern \ncountry. The third sister, a student, is a citizen and resident of Algeria and resides with \nApplicant\u2019s parents. (Ex. 3; Tr. 72-75.) \n \n \nOther than her immediate family in Algeria, Applicant also has occasional contact \nwith her grandmother and with an aunt, both citizens and residents of Algeria. She has \noccasional e-mail contact with the aunt and she goes to see her when she is in Algeria. \n(Tr. 78-79.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was a young adult in her parents\u2019 household in Algeria, she and \nher family witnessed brutal acts of terrorism in their community. She lost family \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmembers in terrorist bombings, and her own father and younger sister were targeted \nbecause, as police department employees, they worked against terrorists.  Because \nApplicant\u2019s father has been retired for many years, he is no longer targeted by terrorists. \nHer sister no longer lives in Algeria, and she is no longer a target. (Tr. 63-64.) \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Algeria in 2001, 2002 and 2007. Now that Applicant, two of \nher brothers, and two of her sisters no longer live in Algeria, they find it more \ncomfortable and convenient to avoid travel to Algeria and to meet, instead, in France or \nin another European country. In 2007, when Applicant\u2019s parents were divorcing, \nApplicant and her siblings met in Europe to discuss how they would care for their \nmother after the divorce. Her two brothers in France now provide for their mother\u2019s \nsupport.  Applicant and her sister who lives in the United States sometimes provide their \nmother with lesser amounts of money on an irregular basis. Last year, Applicant met her \nmother in France for a visit.  (Tr. 85-87, 98-100.) \n \n \nApplicant is grateful for her opportunities as a U.S. citizen, and she believes her \nwork for the government contractor who employs her has value in the war on terror. She \nstated: \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to know that I\u2019m useful, and I do it also for the U.S., \nbecause this country has provided me with everything.\u201d (Tr. 90-92.)    \n \n \nApplicant stated her fidelity to the United States as follows: \u201cI love the USA and . \n. . I will never hurt its interests in any way, this country was good to me, it has offered \nme security, freedom and respect and I will never do anything to lose these privileges, \nnever. \u201c (Ex. A.) \n \n \nThe Director of Applicant\u2019s office, a retired officer with nearly 30 years of \nexperience in the United States military, appeared as her personal representative and \nas a witness on her behalf. He held a high level security clearance, had served as a \nmilitary attach\u00e9, and supported the intelligence community. He stated: \n \nI understand the Government\u2019s concern with regard to particular countries \nin the world, and I understand the Government\u2019s concern with regard to \nelements that operate within those countries.  However, in order for the \nUnited States government and the United States national security \napparatus to gain intelligence and to conduct meaningful analysis on that \nintelligence, the only way to do it, the best way to do it, is using a source \nfrom that country. \n \n(Tr. 27.) \n \n \nThe Director characterized Applicant as \u201ca gifted linguist and a wonderful \nemployee\u201d who performed her duties in a distinguished manner.  Her linguistic expertise \nin classical Arabic and in French, and her knowledge of North African cultures, enabled \nher to provide in-depth analyses of great value to senior-level policy makers. (Ex. D.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \n \nAn official of one of the entities served by Applicant\u2019s Directorate offered the \nfollowing evaluation of her character and her work: \n \nIt is my pleasure to write this letter of reference for [Applicant] in \nacknowledgement of her dedication to her profession and in the service of \nthe United States Government.  During my long professional association \nwith [Applicant], she has consistently demonstrated the highest levels of \ncommitment in providing mission critical support on substantive issues on \nNorth Africa, to include counterterrorism-related projects. [Applicant] has \nworked tirelessly to ensure that analysts and policymakers have received \naccurate and timely information while preparing her reports and \ntranslations. [Applicant\u2019s] in-depth knowledge of linguistic and cultural \nmatters has proven invaluable to our customers, particularly given the \ncurrent shortage of real expertise in Middle East study disciplines. \n[Applicant] has demonstrated discretion while working on projects and \nmay be relied upon to use good judgment when supporting a variety of US \nGovernment and military customers. \n \nTo my knowledge, there are no issues of concern that would reflect \nnegatively upon [Applicant\u2019s] character or her dedication to the United \nStates and its interests.  I recommend her without hesitation for a position \nof trust.  \n \n(Ex. J.) \n \n \n  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Algeria, as provided by \nDepartment Counsel from official documents of the United States government1: \n \nAlgeria is a multi-party constitutional republic that has suffered from \ndomestic terrorism throughout the 1990s and into the present. The \nAlgerian government declared a state of emergency in 1992, which \nremains in effect to the present day, due to what government authorities \n \n1 The documents from which these facts are drawn are as follows:  Algeria, Country Specific Information, \nUnited States Department of State, dated November 10, 2008 (4 pages); Background Note: Algeria, \nUnited States Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, dated October 2007 (11 pages); \nTravel Warning: Algeria, United States Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, dated August 22, \n2008 (2 pages); Country Reports on Terrorism: Chapter 2 - Country Reports: Middle East and North \nAfrica Overview, United States Department of State, dated April 30, 2008 (24 pages); Country Reports on \nHuman Rights Practices \u2013 2007: Algeria, United States Department of State, dated March 11, 2008 (18 \npages); Algeria: Current Issues, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Library of \nCongress, dated April 24, 2007 (6 pages); Press Statement, U.S. Condemns Terrorist Attacks, United \nStates Department of State, released and dated April 11, 2007 (1 page); Statement for the Record: \nNational Counterintelligence Executive, The Honorable Michelle Van Cleave before the House Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Immigration, Border Security & Claims, dated September 15, 2005 (9 pages); Annual \nThreat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence for the Senate Armed Services Committee, \ndated February 27, 2008 (45 pages); and The National Counterintelligence Strategy of the United States \nof America, 2007 (13 pages). \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncall \u2018persistent terrorism.\u2019 Although making modest efforts toward \ndemocratic progress, Algeria\u2019s 16-year-old state of emergency has been \nreportedly used to justify governmental abuses of human rights.  \nAccording to a 2007 United States Department of State report on human \nrights practices in Algeria, the government continued to fail to account for \nthousands of persons who disappeared in detention in the 1990s. Further, \nthere were other significant human rights violations regarding abuse and \ntorture, corruption and lack of government transparency, official impunity, \nprolonged pre-trial detention, as well as other due process issues.  \nRestrictions of civil liberties such as privacy, freedom of speech, press, \nassembly, association and movement were also recorded, as were \nlimitation on religious freedom, including increased regulation of non-\nMuslim worship. Gender discrimination and abuse, restrictions on workers\u2019 \nrights, child abuse, and human trafficking were also recorded among the \nhuman rights violations in Algeria. \n \nAlthough the United States seeks to support the recent democratic efforts \nin Algeria, the U.S. Government has become increasingly concerned with \nthe changing nature of terrorism in Algeria and its global effects.  What \nwas once primarily domestic terrorism aimed at Algerian government \ninfrastructure has expanded to an affiliation with Al-Qaeda and \ninternational targets. \n \nApproximately 35 known and suspected terrorist organizations throughout \nthe world currently target the United States for intelligence gathering.  Of \nthese, Al-Qaeda is the terrorist organization that presents the greatest \nthreat to U.S. interests, including the Homeland. Al-Qaeda continues to \nplot attacks against the United States and maintains active connections \nwith affiliates throughout the Middle Ease and northern Africa, now to \ninclude Algeria.  Moreover, terrorist threats to the United States remain the \npre-eminent challenge to the Intelligence Community, both operationally \nand analytically. \n \nA recent upsurge in terrorist attacks has only increase the U.S. \nGovernment concerns. Within Algeria, terrorist groups have targeted \nforeigners and remained active around the southern regions and borders \nof the country where approximately 1,100 American citizens live and work \nin oil and gas fields. \n \nAlthough the United States has worked with the Algerian government to \nhelp combat terrorism in that country, the Algerian government projects \ninconsistent policies regarding its position on international terrorism, which \nare often in conflict with the United States.  Despite publicly condemning \nthe September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States by Al-\nQaeda, as well as condemning international terrorism, Algerian officials \ndistinguish between terrorism and what they consider to be legitimate \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \narmed resistance by recognized terrorist groups such as Hamas, \nPalestinian Islamic Jihad and Hizballah in the Palestinian occupied \nterritories. Moreover, Algeria is now considered to be a source of \ninternational terrorists, and many Algerian terrorists have been arrested in \ncounter-terrorism operations in Europe and the United States. 2  \n  \n(HE 1, footnotes omitted.)  \n \n \n \n \n \n   Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n \n2 I recognize that terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence \nservices. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving foreign preference arises \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States.\u201d  Such an individual \u201cmay be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  These potentially disqualifying conditions are as follows: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and  \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nAfter becoming a U.S. citizen in 2004, Applicant renewed her Algerian passport \nin 2007. She did this to avoid purchasing a visa to enter Algeria with her U.S. passport \nand to make travel to Algeria more convenient in the future.  She did not know that \nacquiring an Algerian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen might raise security \nconcerns under Guideline C. Applicant\u2019s possession of an active Algerian passport  \nraises a security concern under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). \n \n \nThere is one Foreign Preference mitigating condition that could apply in this \ncase. If an individual\u2019s passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated, then AG \u00b6 11(e) might be applicable. On \nApril 21, 2009, Applicant provided DOHA with notice that she had surrendered her \nAlgerian passport to an appropriate authority of the Algerian government. In addition, \nshe filed a copy of a letter from the Algerian authority acknowledging her surrender of \nher Algerian passport.  I conclude that AG \u00b6 11(e) applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nOfficial U.S. government documents provided by Department Counsel \nemphasize that the United States supports the efforts of Algeria toward a more \ndemocratic government. The United States recognizes that Algeria is not a state \nsponsor of terrorism, is battling an increase in international terrorism within its borders, \nand is aware of the ascendency of Al-Qaeda and its operatives within the country. The \nAlgerian government does not target U.S. citizens in order to obtain classified \ninformation from them.  However, despite the government of Algeria\u2019s actions to \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                           \nsuppress domestic and international terrorist groups within its borders, the threat of \nterrorism remains and terrorist groups threaten U.S. interests in Algeria. \n \n \nAdditionally, the U.S. government recognizes that Algeria has carried out human \nrights abuses against its own citizens. The government\u2019s human rights abuses include   \ntorture, prolonged pre-trial detention, and government corruption.    \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline. Applicant admitted the SOR allegation at \u00b6 1.b., but she provided information \nthat one of her two younger sisters is no longer a resident of Algeria but resides in \nanother Middle Eastern country.  \n \nApplicant admitted the government\u2019s factual allegations that her parents are \ncitizens and residents of Algeria; that one of her brothers is a dual citizen of Algeria and \nFrance and works for an organization funded by the French government; and that \nApplicant had traveled to Algeria in 2001, 2002, and 2007 to visit her family members \nthere. She partially rebutted the allegation that two of her younger sisters are citizens \nand residents of Algeria by providing information that one of the sisters is no longer \nliving in Algeria. These facts raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d3 AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation.\u201d   \n \n \nWhen Applicant admitted these allegations, the burden shifted to her to mitigate \nthe resulting security concerns. Several mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, \nthe country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  \nIf \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or \nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might apply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens \n \n3 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb.8, 2001). \n\n \n11 \n \n \nis so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply.  \n \n \nApplicant is a dutiful daughter, and she has strong filial relationships with her \nparents and siblings. She stays in contact with her parents and with her siblings in \nAlgeria and France and is concerned about their well-being. Her relationship with her \nfamily members in Algeria and France is based on long-standing family ties of affection \nand obligation.  \n \n \nAlgeria cooperates with the United States in combating terrorism. The \ngovernment of Algeria does not target U.S. citizens to acquire protected information. \nThe positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family members in Algeria do not involve the \ngovernment or the military, and they would have no interest in acquiring protected \ninformation.  Only their physical presence in Algeria creates the potential that Applicant \nwould confront a choice between their interests and the security interests of the United \nStates. Thus, AG \u00b6 8(a) has some application. \n \n \nApplicant produced significant evidence establishing mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n8(b). Based on her relationship and depth of loyalty to the United States, she can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. She has committed \nto a life as a U.S. citizen. She is married to a U.S. citizen, and she and her husband are \nraising their children as U.S. citizens. Significantly, Applicant sought work as an Arabic \nlinguist and translator in order to assist the U.S. in its efforts to combat international \nterrorism and protect the homeland. Her supervisors attest to her unique abilities as a \nArab linguist, translator, and expert on North African cultural matters. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to establish the applicability of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n8(c). Her contacts with her parents are familial and intense. While perhaps sporadic, her \nrelationships with her brothers were on-going and familial and focused on providing for \nthe well-being of her mother.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(c) cannot be given full application. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                           \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Two \ncircumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First, even though \nAlgeria is an ally of the United States, it has committed serious human rights abuses \nagainst its own citizens, and there is a serious problem with terrorists in Algeria. \nSecond, three of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are citizens and residents of \nAlgeria, raising the possibility that they could be subject to such abuses or to coercion \nby terrorists, which could raise security concerns for Applicant. \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance.  Out of a sense of patriotism and love for the United States, Applicant sought \nwork as an Arab-speaking linguist. She provides vital information to officials on terrorist \noperations in North Africa.  Nothing in her record suggests that she has ever taken an \naction that would cause potential harm to the United States. She takes her loyalty to the \nUnited States seriously. As noted previously, Applicant has strong familial connections \nto the United States, and these connections are more substantial than her connections \nto her family members living in Algeria. Those who have witnessed her work as an Arab \nlinguist and translator assessed her as trustworthy, conscientious, responsible, and \ndedicated.   \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s commendable \nperformance as an Arab linguist and translator, I conclude Applicant has fully mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence.4 Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guidelines C and B. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n4 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Assuming that a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 11 and AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the \nwhole person analysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case.  \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B  \n \nFOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is   \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On July 29, 2008, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on August 22, 2008, Applicant constructively admitted\nthree of nine allegations regarding finances and denied all allegations raised with\nregard to personal conduct. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s request to have the matter\nheard before an Administrative Judge on October 2, 2008. I was assigned the case that\nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n Tr. 43.\n1\n Tr. 40.\n2\n Compare Ex. 1 (Security Clearance Application) at 8; Tr. 42.\n3\n Tr. 44.\n4\n2\nsame day. Applicant and Department Counsel agreed to a hearing date of October 23,\n2008. A Notice of Hearing to that effect was issued on October 6, 2008. \nThe hearing was timely convened. As a preliminary matter an Amendment to the\nSOR was received, signed by Department Counsel and Applicant. By that amendment,\nthe Government revised allegations 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c.. Applicant denied\nthe amended allegations. Allegations 1.i., 2.d., and 2.e. were deleted. During the\nhearing, Department Counsel introduced six documents which were admitted into the\nrecord as exhibits (Exs.) 1-6 without objection. Applicant introduced six documents\nwhich were admitted into the record as Exs. A-F without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf; no witnesses appeared. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October\n31, 2008, and the record was closed on November 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old technical consultant, performing networking and\ntelephonic installation for a government contractor. He has a high school diploma and\nattended two years of post-secondary technical school for electronics. He is married\nand has three minor daughters.\nIn the mid-1990s, Applicant sold the family home for a smaller house they\nintended to refurbish. During the renovations, they planned on living in a mobile home\nsituated on the same lot.  Expenses on the home remodeling far exceeded what they\n1\nhad expected. Meanwhile, Applicant\u2019s elderly mother-in-law\u2019s health was in decline and\nneeded assistance. She came to live with the family for a year before her condition\nnecessitated a hospital stay and professional nursing care. A year after her arrival, she\npassed away. Applicant\u2019s wife developed a crippling hand disorder that precluded her\nfrom working as a waitress, which started her on a protracted period of unemployment.2\nThen the family was informed that they could have only one dwelling per lot. Applicant\nhad to buy a new lot on which to move the mobile home. As a result of this conflux of\nproblems, bills continued to arrive and become delinquent. Applicant sought Chapter 7\nbankruptcy protection in September 1997.\nIn 2004, Applicant and his wife bought a new home.  Shortly thereafter,\n3\nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law needed major medical treatment. She and her son moved in\nwith Applicant\u2019s family shortly after they moved into the house.  A person with\n4\nconsiderable disabilities, the sister-in-law relied upon her son for transportation as she\nreceived essential medical treatments in a nearby hospital. Applicant and his wife\n\n Tr. 42.\n5\n Id.\n6\n Id.\n7\n Tr. 53.\n8\n Ex. 1 (Security Clearance Application), at 25-26.\n9\n The original SOR incorrectly cites to these questions as being Sections 38 and 39. The amended SOR\n10\nincorrectly refers to Section 28b as Section 29.\n Id. at 26.\n11\n SOR allegations 1.c. and 1.a., respectively. Included in the Chapter 13 filing (SOR allegation 1.a.) was a\n12\n$700 obligation to a furniture company, noted in the SOR under allegation 1.d. See Tr. 35.\n Ex. A (W ife\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, dated May 15, 2001); Tr.24-26.\n13\n Excluding the debt noted in SOR allegation 1.d. and conceded by the Government as being included in the\n14\nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing.\n SOR allegation 1.e.\n15\n3\nhelped care and provide for her during her stay. They stayed with Applicant and his\nfamily for about six months. She died shortly after leaving Applicant\u2019s home. Meanwhile,\nApplicant was faced with a mortgage for which he should never have qualified.  He\n5\nalmost immediately began having difficulty making the house payments. He also had a\nvan requiring large monthly payments.  \u201cAnd we just had more bills than we could pay\n6\nand stay in the house.\u201d  Applicant became unable to meet his obligations. He filed for\n7\nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2005, on which regular payments have been made.\nIn November 2007, Applicant completed a security clearance application. He did\nso without first consulting a recent credit report.  He believed all of his delinquent debts\n8\nhad been included in his bankruptcy. On the application, at Section 27, he fully detailed\nboth the 1997 and 2005 bankruptcy filings. In doing so, he constructively gave notice\nthat he had considerably delinquent debts within the past seven years of his\napplication.  However, in answering the following sections, Sections 28a and 28b,  he\n9\n10\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to questions as to whether he had been over 180 days delinquent on\nany debts in the prior seven years or was currently delinquent on any debts over 90\ndays.  He further testified that he believed his answers to be true.\n11\nIn sum, Applicant filed bankruptcy twice, Chapter 7 in 1997, and Chapter 13 in\n2005.  Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report shows a third bankruptcy, from 2001, but it is an\n12\nerroneous entry for a bankruptcy filed by his wife.  The Government alleges that\n13\ndespite the bankruptcies, Applicant owes a cumulative delinquent debt of $1,943 : $74\n14\nto a credit union, an amount which was charged off,  $100 to a creditor, which was\n15\n\n SOR allegation 1.f. (as amended).\n16\n SOR allegation 1.g. (as amended).\n17\n SOR allegation 1.h. (as amended).\n18\n Tr. 33.\n19\n Tr. 39. Appellant was given 14 days following the hearing to submit to Department Counsel any evidence\n20\nof payment or inclusion in the bankruptcy, but no further documents were timely received. \n Tr. 46.\n21\n Tr. 48.\n22\n Tr. 55-56.\n23\n4\nturned over for collection,  $50 to a creditor, which was turned over for collection,  and\n16\n17\n$1,719 on an account since placed for collection as a bad debt.18\nApplicant denied the debts alleged. As proof, Applicant introduced Exhibit B,\nNotice of Claims Filed in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which shows that the obligations\nfor $100 (SOR allegation 1.f., as revised) and $50 (SOR allegation 1.g., as revised)\nwere included in that filing. He also introduced Exhibit C, an October 22, 2008, credit\nreport, indicating that the account noted at SOR allegation 1.h, as revised, is now at a\nzero balance by virtue of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  The account balance of $74,\n19\nwhich apparently failed to be included in the bankruptcy, remains unpaid.20\nLate in 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife was in a car accident which damaged her foot and\ncaused deep thrombosis. Immediate surgery was required. As a result, she has been\nunable to return to work. Aside from that impact on the family coffers, Applicant has no\nlarge debt. His wife is currently awaiting qualification for unemployment assistance\nbased on her disability. While she waits out that protracted process, she is\ncontemplating finding some form of work she can perform. If his wife can return to work\nor when she is finally eligible for Social Security disability payments, the family will be\ndoing much better financially.  They have no car payments and Applicant nets\n21\napproximately $3,250 per month in take-home pay.  With three girls in public school,\n22\nranging in age between 10 and 17, little is left at the end of the month after all living\nexpenses and extras are paid. Applicant currently has three credit cards. None of the\nbalances ever exceed $500. Two are currently 30 days past due for amounts between\n$230 and $222.  On the other hand, Applicant is generally keeping up with his debts\n23\nand living within his income. The family lives simply, but comfortably.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n24\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n25\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n26\n Id.\n27\n5\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n24\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n25\n26\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n27\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\n\n Id.\n28\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n29\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n30\n6\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n28\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n29\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGUIDELINE F\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n30\nunder this guideline.  \nIn 1997 and in 2005, Applicant\u2019s expenses exceeded his income, debts became\ndelinquent, and he was forced to resort to bankruptcy protection. Today, one minor debt\nfor $74 appears to remain delinquent and unpaid. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Appellant to overcome\nthe case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant bought a modest house in the 1990s he wished to remodel. Expenses\ntoward that project exceeded his expectations, and a mobile home on the property had\nto be moved and a new lot purchased for its placement. While both situations arose\nunexpectedly, neither was necessarily unforeseeable had more diligence been\nexercised. What was unforeseeable and beyond Applicant\u2019s control, however, was his\nwife\u2019s inability to work due to a crippling hand injury and his mother-in-law\u2019s need of\nend-term care. Similarly, with regard to the facts leading to the 2005 bankruptcy,\nApplicant realizes the mortgage he undertook was more than he could afford, especially\nwhen he had an expensive vehicle note. To the extent he and his wife provided end-\ncare assistance to his sister-in-law, however, those expenses were unforeseeable.\nConsequently, with regard to his wife\u2019s injury and his in-laws\u2019 final illnesses, Financial\n\n7\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies.\nApplicant provided no evidence that he has received financial counseling. He\nhas, however, demonstrated that all the debts noted in the amended SOR but one \u2013 a\ndelinquent debt for $74 \u2013 have been satisfied. It is troublesome, however, that so minor\na debt has not been satisfied in the months since he received the SOR. Also troubling\nis the fact that two of his credit cards are currently over 30 days past due. Conversely,\nApplicant has met his responsibilities with the bankruptcy court. He has realistically\nadjusted his budget to account for his wife\u2019s current disability and unemployment and is\ncontemplating options for when she either returns to work or receives disability. While it\ncannot be said Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control, he has demonstrated\nthat considerable progress has been made toward resolving the problem. Therefore, FC\nMC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d)\napplies. None of the other mitigating conditions, however, apply. \nGUIDELINE E\nUnder this guideline, examination is made of an Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information based on his past personal\nconduct and actions. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process. Based on the amended SOR, Department Counsel argues\nthat Applicant actively falsified material facts on his security clearance application when\nhe denied he had debts currently delinquent over 90 days. To support this claim, he\npoints to the debts noted at allegations 1.d. through 1.h.\nApplicant denies he falsely answered any application questions. Not having first\nconsulted his most recent credit report, he had no idea what his credit report revealed.\nHowever, he felt sure that any delinquent accounts had been addressed through the\n2005 bankruptcy. That bankruptcy was duly described on the security clearance\napplication on page 28 at the end of Section 27 \u2013 inches above his denials regarding\ndelinquent debts in Sections 28a and b.\nApplicant apparently overlooked the $74 debt when he was preparing his\nbankruptcy petition, just as he missed it when he completed his application by not first\nchecking his credit report. Given the nominal sum at issue, Applicant\u2019s highly credible\ntestimony, and his success in demonstrating that the other four accounts alleged were,\nin fact, included in his bankruptcy, it is difficult to conclude Applicant deliberately\nfalsified facts simply to conceal one minor outstanding debt. I find no falsity or\nconcealment was committed. Lacking that element, a Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition cannot be sustained. Applicant\u2019s evidence and explanation mitigate personal\nconduct security concerns. \n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a forthright and mature man who is quick to accept blame for poor\nbusiness choices, yet capable of both articulating and documenting his efforts in\nmanaging his finances. While he found himself over-extended in the 1990s due to a\nvariety of factors, the story behind his most recent bankruptcy is an all too familiar tale\nin this recent economic climate. He was extended a mortgage which grew beyond his\nmeans, other accounts suffered, and his personal finances became undone. He has\ncomplied with the terms of the bankruptcy court. Applicant has made great strides to\nmodify and monitor his family\u2019s expenditures. He is committed to holding his family to\ntheir budget. \nThe Government\u2019s initial SOR was revised, with many prior allegations withdrawn\nto conform with the evidence. The evidence, however, showed this Applicant has only\ntwice sought bankruptcy protection, not thrice. Of several alleged delinquent debts\namounting to about $2,500, he showed that all but one $74 debt was addressed in his\n2005 bankruptcy petition. Applicant did well in addressing those allegations head on.\nWhat remains is an examination of Applicant today. He has no large or unwieldy\ndebts, nor does he have any car note payments. He is currently budgeting within his\nmeans and comfortably providing for his family, although little is left for extras. He is\nable to meet the daily needs of both his spouse and three maturing girls on his income.\nFamily resources should be much improved when his wife\u2019s disability or work situation\nis resolved. While two credit cards are just over 30 days late, his use of credit is minor.\nIt would be easy to contemplate various future scenarios as to his future solvency or\ninsolvency, particularly given the current economic climate, but this process demands\nthat I avoid drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. The\nsimple fact is that at present, Applicant is living within his means with only a $74\ndelinquent debt outstanding. The meager amount of Applicant\u2019s unresolved delinquent\ndebt is not large enough to be of security concern.\n\n9\nMoreover, there is no indication that Applicant committed a falsity or otherwise\ntried to conceal the existence of the $74 which, at the time of the hearing, remained\nunresolved. Given his candid testimony and other factors previously discussed,\npersonal conduct security concerns are similarly mitigated. With security concerns thus\nmitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and J (Criminal Conduct). Eligibility for continued access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 26, 2007. On July \n21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines G and J. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nDecember 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 6, 2008; answered it on \nAugust 20, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on August 21, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nSeptember 25, 2008, and the case was assigned to me the following day. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on October 2, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 28, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented \nthe testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through S, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The record closed on October 28, 2008. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on November 6, 2008. \n \nRequest for Continuance \n \n \nOn October 2, 2008, Applicant requested that his hearing be postponed until the \nsecond week of December 2008, in order to be represented by an attorney who is a \nfriend of the family (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I). On the same day, I informed Applicant that I \nwould not postpone the hearing based on the information provided. I told Applicant I \nneeded an entry of appearance from his intended attorney and a detailed justification for \nlengthy delay he had requested (HX II). On October 23, 2008, I reminded Applicant of \nmy earlier ruling (HX III), and he replied that he would not be represented by an attorney \nand that he was ready to proceed on the scheduled date (HX IV; Tr. 56). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-f and \n2.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old aviation mechanic employed by a defense contractor. \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from January 1997 until January \n2002, and he has worked for his current employer since leaving active duty. He held a \nclearance during his Marine Corps service and retained it when he was hired by his \ncurrent employer (Tr. 15). He was separated from active duty under honorable \nconditions and received the Good Conduct Medal (AX A at 2). \n \n \nIn 1989, when Applicant was 16 or 17 years old, he was charged with assault \nafter he slashed a man\u2019s face with a bottle during a bar fight (Tr. 70-72). He testified he \ncame to the defense of his older brother (Tr. 121-22). He was tried as a juvenile, fined, \nand placed on probation.  \n \nIn 1990, Applicant was charged with criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, and \npossession of liquor by a minor. He pleaded guilty to illegal possession of liquor and \nwas placed on probation. In August 1991, he was again charged with illegal possession \nof liquor by a minor. His probation was revoked, and he served 15 days in jail (Tr. 72).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn October 1992, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of liquor \n(DUI). He was sentenced to 60 days in jail, with all jail time suspended except 72 hours \n(Tr. 73). In 1994, he was charged with DUI and eluding the police. He pleaded guilty to \nDUI and was fined. Regarding the charge of eluding the police, he testified he was lost \nand did not realize the police were following him (Tr. 74). \n \n \nIn May 2001, while serving on active duty in the Marine Corps, Applicant was \ncharged by civilian police with inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant. He and his \ngirlfriend had an argument, and he tried to restrain her after she slapped and scratched \nhim. A neighbor called the police, who detained Applicant because he accidently struck \nher lip while they were scuffling and the police noticed her lip was bleeding. He posted \nbond and his girlfriend later picked him up at the police station. He notified his military \ncommander of the incident. He was not prosecuted by military or civilian authorities (GX \n4 at 3; GX 6; Tr. 56, 78-80, 125). This incident was not alcohol-related. \n \n \nIn November 2003, Applicant was charged with second degree assault. He \ntestified he came home late from a bachelor party and saw that his girlfriend had left \ntheir six-month-old son unattended. He saw his girlfriend talking to a neighbor across \nthe street. He and his girlfriend began arguing, and he unintentionally knocked a cell \nphone from her hand. The neighbor, apparently believing Applicant had struck her, \nknocked him to the ground. During the ensuing struggle, Applicant defended himself by \n\u201cchoking the neighbor out\u201d and injuring his esophagus. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend called the \npolice. Both Applicant and the neighbor were intoxicated. Applicant was placed on \nprobation before judgment for 30 days and required to pay the neighbor\u2019s $400 medical \nbill (GX 4 at 4; GX 5 at 3-6; AX S; Tr. 81-90, 127-28).   \n \nIn June 2005, Applicant stopped at a bar near his house and had several drinks, \nknowing he could walk home if necessary. A female bartender with whom he was \nacquainted asked him to remove her ex-boyfriend from the bar because he was causing \na commotion. Applicant agreed to take the ex-boyfriend to another bar about three miles \naway (AX B; Tr. 56-57). Police stopped him on the way and charged him with failing to \ndrive to the right of the center line, driving while impaired, and driving under the \ninfluence. Pursuant to his lawyer\u2019s recommendation, he began an outpatient program \nfor alcohol abuse in July 2005, while awaiting trial. He began attending AA meetings at \nabout this time.  \n \nIn September 2005, he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and not guilty \nto the other charges, which were disposed of by nolle prosequi. He was placed on \nprobation before judgment and paid a fine (GX 4 at 5). As a condition of his probation, \nhe continued his outpatient treatment for alcohol abuse until May 2006, when he \nsuccessfully completed it. His prognosis by a licensed clinical alcohol and drug abuse \ncounselor was \u201cgood.\u201d The discharge notes stated, \u201cNo further treatment needed.\u201d His \nprimary diagnosis was alcohol abuse in early partial remission. The staff \nrecommendations upon discharge were to abstain from alcohol, continue his AA \ninvolvement, and to stay focused on recovery (AX D). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn February and March 2006, Applicant voluntarily received inpatient treatment \nfor alcohol abuse. He testified that during his outpatient treatment issues from his family \nhistory had surfaced and he felt they needed to be addressed with one-on-one \ncounseling (Tr. 59). His mother is an alcoholic and was married four times. Applicant \nchanged his last name after his mother\u2019s first divorce and replaced his birth father\u2019s \nname with his grandfather\u2019s name (Tr. 70). During his inpatient treatment he was \ndiagnosed by a medical doctor as alcohol dependent. His discharge summary recites \nthat he was always attentive and actively participated in his treatment. His counselor \ncommented that he needed to continue working on relapse prevention. His prognosis \nfor recovery at discharge was \u201cguarded\u201d (AX C). He stopped drinking at about this time \n(Tr. 100).  \n \nShortly after completing his inpatient treatment, Applicant obtained a prescription \nfor a drug to reduce his craving for alcohol. He did not use it regularly because of its bad \neffects on his digestive system, but he keeps it with him in case he feels stressed and is \nunable to contact someone in his support network (Tr. 112-14). \n \nIn March 2003, while continuing to work as an aviation mechanic, Applicant \nstarted a lawn care business to generate some additional income (AX E). In October \n2006, all his equipment was stolen, and he borrowed $5,000 to replace it (AX F; Tr. 60-\n61). \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant purchased a home. In January 2008, Applicant\u2019s lawn-\nservice business declined, some of his clients stopped paying him, and he lost one of \nhis larger commercial contracts (Tr. 63). He fell behind on his home mortgage payments \n(AX G).  \n \nIn September or October 2007, Applicant had two relapses, after about a year \nand eight months of sobriety (Tr. 100). The first occurred when he drank several beers \nat home because he was embarrassed by his delinquent mortgage payments and under \nstress by his level of indebtedness and the downturn in his lawn care business (Tr. 102-\n07). The second occurred within two or three weeks as a result of the same stressors \n(Tr. 108-11).  \n \nApplicant currently attends AA meetings twice a week, and he has a local \nsponsor (Tr. 120).  In addition, his mother, an AA participant for many years, is his \u201clong \ndistance sponsor.\u201d They talk at least once a day (Tr. 115). One of Applicant\u2019s co-\nsponsors in AA describes him as a \u201cstrong influence\u201d in their meetings. He is the first \nperson to arrive at meetings, helps with administration, and is the last to leave (AX H). \nAnother co-sponsor believes he has become a stronger person because of his past \nproblems (AX I).  \n \nApplicant and his long-time girlfriend (the same person involved in the May 2001 \nincident) were married about three weeks before the hearing. His wife has taken over \nmany of the responsibilities of the lawn service business, significantly reducing his \nstress level (Tr. 115). His financial situation is now under control (Tr. 118-19).  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and stepfather consider him a hard worker who has become \nstronger, healthier, happier, and more productive and certain of his path in life (AX J). \nHis spouse believes he works hard at maintaining sobriety and takes it very seriously. In \nher written statement and her testimony at the hearing, she described him as \ntrustworthy, loyal, and dedicated to his family (AX K; Tr. 133). She testified that, after he \ncompleted the outpatient treatment in March 2006, they had a \u201cwhole new life,\u201d being \nhappy and doing things together as a family (Tr. 129). His father-in-law and mother-in-\nlaw have helped and supported his rehabilitation efforts. They regard him as a \ndedicated, strong, trustworthy, and caring person (AX L).  \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s supervisors considers him one of the best, most dedicated \nmechanics in the shop (AX M). A coworker for the past six years regards him as \ntrustworthy, fair, and helpful (AX N). The lead technician in his shop states that his \nperformance has been exemplary and his integrity is unquestioned (AX O). The lead \ntechnician nominated Applicant as employee of the quarter. Applicant has twice \nreceived cash bonuses of $200 for his performance (AX O and P). He received a letter \nof appreciation from his division manager for his initiative and hard work in the summer \nof 2006 (AX Q). Applicant\u2019s annual performance appraisals for the past six years all \nrated him in the top category of \u201cdistinguished\u201d on a five-level scale. (AX R) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant consumed alcohol to excess from 1991 to \u201cat least\u201d \nSeptember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), was charged with multiple alcohol-related offenses \nbetween 1990 and June 2005 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-f), received outpatient alcohol-related \ncounseling from July 2005 through May 2006 and was diagnosed as suffering from \nalcohol abuse (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and received inpatient treatment of alcohol abuse in \nFebruary 2006 and was diagnosed as suffering from alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6 1.h). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant\u2019s record of alcohol-related \nviolence, underage drinking, and DUI arrests raise this disqualifying condition. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c). This disqualifying \ncondition is raised by Applicant\u2019s numerous instances of drinking to the point of \nimpaired judgment.  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised either by \u201cdiagnosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(d). Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol \ndependence by a medical doctor in the inpatient treatment program raises this \ndisqualifying condition.  \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(e). Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol \nabuse was by a licensed clinical alcohol and drug abuse counselor. Because there is no \nevidence showing that the licensed clinical alcohol and drug abuse counselor had the \nsame qualifications and diagnostic authority as a licensed clinical social worker, this \ndisqualifying condition is not raised. \n \nFinally, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201crelapse after diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 22(f). Applicant\u2019s two relapses in September and October 2007 raise this condition. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (c), (d), and (f), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). The first prong of this \nmitigating condition focuses on the recentness of the conduct. There are no Abright line@ \nrules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nApplicant stopped drinking after completing his inpatient treatment in early 2006. \nHe voluntarily sought treatment beyond the requirements of his probation and gained \nvaluable insights into his behavior. He abstained from drinking until his two relapses in \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSeptember and October 2007, a period of about 20 months. He abstained from the date \nof his last relapse in October 2007 until the date of the hearing, about a year later. He \nhas diligently participated in AA, and he has strong support from his spouse, mother, \nand in-laws. He has continued his outstanding performance at work. There have been \nno alcohol-related incidents since his arrest in June 2005. According to his spouse, \nthere has been a dramatic change in his attitude, stress level, family involvement, and \nlevel of happiness. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. I conclude the \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) is established.  \n \n \nThe second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) and third prong (\u201cunusual circumstances \nunlike to recur\u201d) of AG \u00b6 23(a) are not established; however, the final prong (\u201cdoes not \ncast doubt\u201d) is established. Applicant has aggressively addressed his alcohol \ndependence, gained insight into his behavior, surrounded himself with a support \nnetwork, and conducted himself in a lawful and responsible manner. His focus has \nshifted from irresponsible drinking to focusing on his job and his family. He has \ndemonstrated his determination to maintain his sobriety. I conclude the mitigating \ncondition in AG \u00b6 23(a) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant \nacknowledged his alcohol problems, sought treatment, established a support network, \nabstained from alcohol for 20 months before a relapse, and abstained from alcohol for a \nyear after his relapse. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(d). Applicant has met all the elements of this mitigating condition \nexcept the favorable prognosis. His prognosis from the inpatient program was \n\u201cguarded.\u201d His prognosis from the outpatient program was \u201cgood,\u201d but that prognosis \nwas from a licensed clinical alcohol and drug abuse counsel, not a \u201cmedical \nprofessional\u201d as defined in AG\u00b6 22(d) or a licensed clinical social worker.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was charged with assault in 1989 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), \ninflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), assault in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.c), and the alcohol-related offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-f (SOR \u00b6 2.d). The concern \nraised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30.  \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a) and (c), shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). As discussed \nabove under Guideline G, a substantial time has passed since Applicant\u2019s criminal \nbehavior, and he has abstained from alcohol for a substantial period. I conclude this \nmitigating condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). For the reasons set out above in the discussion of Guideline G, I conclude this \nmitigating condition is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \n\n \n10 \n \n \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment.  \n \n \nApplicant was well-prepared for the hearing. He presented himself as contrite for \nhis past, candid, intelligent, credible, and committed to a responsible lifestyle. In spite of \nhis alcohol-related problems, he has held a security clearance for more than ten years, \napparently without incident. Most of his criminal conduct was alcohol-related, and he \nappears to have his alcohol problem under control.  \n \n \nApplicant is now a mature adult, married, the father of a child, a homeowner, and \na talented and dedicated aviation mechanic. He has grown out of his youthful behavior, \ndealt with the demons from his childhood, received counseling, established a support \nnetwork, and focused himself on his family and his job. He has candidly disclosed his \npast, eliminating the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. He has \ntaken significant steps to minimize the likelihood of recurrence. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames S. DelSordo, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under SOR subparagraphs 1(a-b), (e-j), (l-n), and (p-s) are not at issue in this\n1\nappeal.\n  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge misapplied the pertinent mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\ndefense contractor.  Her financial problems began during her marriage, which has since ended in\ndivorce.  The Judge noted that her difficulties were exacerbated by her divorce, by her loss of a job,\nand by certain actions by her former husband, which included opening accounts in her name without\nher knowledge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant has significant delinquent debt.  In the Analysis portion of\nthe decision he states that the amount of debt which formed the basis of his adverse findings is in\nexcess of $35,000.  These debts were for an Internal Revenue Service lien, a truck loan, public utility\nservices, etc.  Although the Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s problems were affected by matters\noutside her control, he concluded that, upon consideration of the entire record, she had not\ndemonstrated sufficient mitigation to warrant a clearance.  Specifically, he found that Applicant had\nnot demonstrated a good-faith effort to pay off certain of her debts, nor had she shown that her\nactions in regard to those debts were sufficiently responsible fully to mitigate the security concerns\narising from her financial problems.\n Applicant contends that she was harmed by the fact that she was not represented by a lawyer\nat the hearing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000) (\u201cAlthough the Sixth\nAmendment right to assistance of counsel does not apply to DOHA proceedings, an applicant has\na nonconstitutional right to retain a lawyer at his or her own expense.\u201d)  She states that one\nconsequence of this was her failure to ask for an extension of time in which to present matters in her\nbehalf.  The record demonstrates that, prior to the hearing, Applicant was advised of her right to\nemploy counsel, or to have some other person represent her; her right to present evidence and\nwitnesses; her right to cross-examine witnesses against her; and her right to object to evidence.  At\nthe beginning of the hearing, the Judge again advised Applicant of her right to representation and\nher right to present evidence in her behalf.  Tr. at 5.  \nApplicant was, in fact, accompanied at the hearing by a personal representative, who assisted\nher in the presentation of her case, who testified on her behalf, and who presented opening and\nclosing statements for her.  Furthermore, the record suggests that Applicant was aware of her right\nto request an extension of time.  At the close of the hearing the Judge announced that he would hold\nthe record open for two weeks in order to give Applicant an opportunity to present further matters.\nHowever, in response to Applicant\u2019s request, the Judge agreed to hold the record open for an\nadditional week.  Tr. at 128.  A review of the entire record discloses no basis to conclude that\nApplicant was denied a reasonable opportunity to present evidence or that she was otherwise denied\nthe rights due her under the Directive.  See ISCR Case No. 08-03110 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009).\n\n Applicant argues that the Judge either did not consider mitigating evidence, such as the\neffects of her marital problems and job loss on her financial condition, or that he did not give that\nevidence the proper weight.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2\n(App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is not sufficient to rebut that\npresumption.  In the case at issue here, the Judge explicitly discussed the evidence cited by Applicant\nin her brief, but he concluded that the evidence was not sufficient fully to mitigate the security\nconcerns.  This conclusion is sustainable.  While Applicant may disagree with the weight which the\nJudge assigned to that evidence, she has not demonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App.\nBd. Oct. 12, 2007). \n \nApplicant\u2019s appeal submission includes evidence not presented at the hearing, such as IRS\ndocuments and a statement from one of her creditors that a debt had been discharged.  The Board\ncannot consider this new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received\nor considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d)  See also ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3,\n2009).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \nAs stated above, the Judge considered evidence submitted by Applicant.  However, he also\nconsidered evidence less favorable, including apparent inconsistent statements she made concerning\ntwo of her more significant debts, one of which is the tax lien.   The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is\nsustainable on this record.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 25, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 25, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 2, 2009, scheduling the \nhearing for May 19, 2009. The case was reassigned to me on April 21, 2009. The \nJune 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n7. GE 1 though 4 were received without objection. GE 5 to 7 were admitted over \nApplicant\u2019s objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, called one witness, and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through S, which were received without objection. The record \nwas held open for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted a \nseries of documents, which were marked AE T through QQ, and admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 28, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since January 2009. She has a Bachelor of Science degree, \nawarded in 1985. She married in 1998 and divorced in 2007. She has no children, but \nshe was the stepmother of two children while she was married.1  \n \n \nApplicant started incurring financial difficulties while she was married. She and \nher husband had a large mortgage payment, monthly car loan payments, and two \nchildren to provide for. Her finances were further exacerbated by her separation, \ndivorce, and the loss of her job. Her ex-husband took some actions designed to hurt her \nfinancially, including opening accounts in her name without her permission. She was \nunemployed from January 2007 through March 2007.2 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts, totaling about $44,066. In her answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted to all the debts alleged in the SOR with the exception of \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. She also provided additional information to \nsupport her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Specific debts are addressed \nbelow. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent debt of $737 owed to a credit card company. \nApplicant has consistently denied ever having an account with this company. The debt \nis listed on the credit report of April 26, 2007, but it is not listed on the more recent credit \nreports obtained on April 10, 2008 and January 6, 2009. Applicant disputed the debt on-\nline in 2007 and sent a dispute letter to the company in February 2009.3 \n \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to owing the $1,048 delinquent \ndebt owed to a bank, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Other than that admission, she has \nconsistently denied owing this debt. She admitted that she had a checking account with \nthe bank but stated that it was closed with no balance. She denied that she ever had a \ncredit card with this bank. The debt is listed on the credit reports of April 26, 2007 and \nApril 10, 2008, reporting the debt as a credit card account with the date of last action on \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 44-47, 95; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 93-95, 112-113; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n3 Tr. at 48-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5-7; AE A. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nthe account as occurring in 2001. The debt is not listed on the January 6, 2009 credit \nreport. Applicant sent a dispute letter to the bank in February 2009.4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a federal tax lien of $13,232 filed against Applicant in 2002. \nThe lien is listed on the credit reports of April 26, 2007, April 10, 2008, and January 6, \n2009. Applicant listed the lien on her Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) \ndated March 23, 2007, but she indicated that it was paid in May 2006. She was \ninterviewed for her background investigation in May 2007. She told the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator that she believed the lien was for federal \ntaxes that she owed from 1984, 1985, and 1986. She stated that she was unaware that \nshe owed the IRS until she received a letter in about 2004 that stated she owed about \n$13,000. She told the agent that she made a payment plan in 2004, and paid $250 per \nmonth for about ten months. She stated that she paid the lien off in May 2005 with \nmoney she received when she refinanced her home. In July 2008, Applicant certified \nthe accuracy of the Report of Investigation (ROI) that summarized her interview with the \ninvestigator. She made no changes or additions. DOHA sent interrogatories and asked \nApplicant to provide proof that the lien was paid. She responded in October 2008, and \nstated that the lien was in her ex-husband\u2019s name on the house that was in his name. \nShe stated that the house was sold in May 2006, and her ex-husband would not give \nher the paperwork required to prove the lien was paid. She testified that the tax lien was \nfor property taxes owed on the house in her ex-husband\u2019s name. She stated that the \nIRS would not disclose any information to her about the tax lien because her name was \nnot on the lien. She also indicated that the county court would not release information \nabout the lien for the same reason. She was asked if she had received refunds when \nshe filed her tax returns, as that could be circumstantial evidence that she did not owe \nthe IRS. She stated that she received a refund last year. She was given the opportunity \nafter the record closed to contact the IRS and have them provide a statement of any \npending tax liability and/or provide proof that she received a tax refund. She submitted \ntwo documents from the IRS. One document stated that additional information was \nrequired to process her 2008 tax year return. The other document stated the IRS had \nnot completed processing her request, but would respond within 45 days. She wrote \nthat her 2007 tax information is in a box in her storage bin and it would take too long to \nfind it.5 \n \n \nA judgment of $1,204 was entered against Applicant on behalf of a financial \ninstitution in about April 2004, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant listed this judgment on \nher 2007 SF 86. She discussed the judgment with the OPM investigator in her 2007 \ninterview. She stated that the plaintiff was a collection company but she did not \nremember who owned the original debt. She stated that she appeared in court and \nadmitted that she owed the money. When she responded to DOHA interrogatories in \nMarch 2008, she wrote that she was \u201ctrying to get a loan\u201d to resolve the judgment. She \nadmitted to owing the judgment when she responded to the SOR. At the hearing she \ntestified that she was uncertain about this debt. She was asked if she went to court for \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 52-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5-7; AE B, W-Y. \n \n5 Tr. at 31-35, 55-56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-7; AE M, U, V, Z, AA.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nthis debt and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She stated that she did not remember if she \nwent to court on this debt in 2004.6 I did not find her testimony credible.  \n \n \nApplicant settled in full the $341 delinquent debt owed to a collection company \non behalf of a telephone services company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, with $110 \npayments on February 13, 2009 and February 14, 2009.7 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $1,177 delinquent credit card debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.f. The company sent her a settlement letter on February 3, 2009, stating the \ncompany would accept $812 in settlement of the debt. When she responded to the SOR \non February 25, 2009, she wrote that she was accepting the settlement and would pay \nthe debt on March 6, 2009. She was unable to make the payments. She contacted the \ncompany and obtained another settlement letter from the company. Applicant agreed to \nsettle the debt with payments of $250 on June 12, 2009, $250 on June 26, 2009, and \n$312 on July 10, 2009. Applicant indicated that she made the first payment.8 \n \n \nApplicant paid the $218 delinquent debt owed to a collection company, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, with a payment of $148 on February 13, 2009.9 \n \n \nApplicant settled in full the $466 delinquent debt owed to a collection company \non behalf of a bank, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, with $242 payments on February 13, 2009 \nand March 24, 2009.10 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j allege delinquent debts of $552 and $576. The original debts \nwere owed to two different credit card companies but they were being collected by the \nsame collection company. Applicant settled in full the $576 delinquent debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, with a payment of $443 made on March 5, 2009. She submitted a settlement \nletter from the collection company dated February 12, 2009, agreeing to accept $363 in \nsettlement of the SOR \u00b6 1.i debt, which had grown to $605, if paid by March 14, 2009. \nShe testified that she paid the $363 in settlement of the debt. Applicant was asked to \nsubmit a receipt of her payment in her post-hearing submissions. She submitted a letter \nfrom the collection company dated June 12, 2009, stating that the debt was settled in \nfull on June 11, 2009.11  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a delinquent debt of $519 owed to a collection company on \nbehalf of a bank. This debt is listed on the three credit reports in evidence. Applicant \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 56-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3, 5-7; AE C, BB. \n \n7 Tr. at 61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D. \n \n8 Tr. at 62-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE CC. \n \n9 Tr. at 64-66; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE E. \n \n10 Tr. at 66-69; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE I, P, S, DD. \n \n11 Tr. at 69-74; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE F, G, R, JJ. \n \n\n \n5 \n \ninitially thought this was the same debt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. Department Counsel \npointed out to her that the credit reports list different account numbers for the two debts. \nApplicant admitted that she had an account with the original bank but she thought she \npaid the debt. She stated that she would notify the creditor and pay the debt. No \nadditional information was submitted on this debt.12 \n \n \nApplicant settled in full the $515 delinquent debt owed to a collection company, \non behalf of a credit card company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l, with a $260 payment on \nFebruary 18, 2009.13 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a delinquent medical debt of $520. The debt is listed on the \ntwo most recent credit reports, but the name of the creditor is not listed. Applicant stated \nthat she believed her doctor sent her bill to the wrong insurance company. She was \nworking with the doctor\u2019s office to correct the situation.14 \n \n \nApplicant bought a new truck in about September 2006, and financed it with a \nloan of about $41,000. Her monthly payments were about $690. She fell behind on the \npayments after she lost her job and the truck was repossessed. The finance company \nsued her for the deficiency owed on the truck and was awarded a judgment of more \nthan $19,000. This debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1o. Applicant paid $100 toward this debt on \nApril 13, 2009. She is hoping to obtain a loan to settle this debt.15 \n \n \nOn February 12, 2009, Applicant paid the $57 delinquent debt owed to a \ncollection company for a returned check, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. In her response to \nthe SOR, Applicant indicated that she would pay the $322 delinquent medical debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q on March 20, 2009. She did not pay the debt on that date; she \npaid the debt with a $370 payment on June 12, 2009.16 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r alleges a delinquent debt of $1,091 owed to a collection company on \nbehalf of a satellite television provider. In her response to the SOR, Applicant stated \nthat she returned the three satellite converter boxes that she had and would pay the \nfinal bill of $328 on March 20, 2009. She submitted a letter to the satellite company \ndated February 12, 2009, which purported to accompany the three boxes that were \nreturned that date. Applicant was informed that the letter was not the best evidence that \nthe boxes were returned. After the hearing she submitted a receipt showing that three \npackages were shipped on June 10, 2009. She paid the company $328 on June 15, \n2009.17 \n                                                          \n12 Tr. at 74-77; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5-7. \n \n13 Tr. at 77-79; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE J. \n \n14 Tr. at 80; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5-6; AE NN, OO. \n \n15 Tr. at 38-42, 81-83; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE O, V, EE. \n \n16 Tr. at 83-86; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE K, FF, II, LL. \n \n17 Tr. at 35-37, 85-88; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE N, GG, PP, QQ. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant paid the $136 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s on February 12, \n2009.18 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.t alleges a delinquent debt of $1,592 owed to a collection company on \nbehalf of a public utility company. Applicant admitted to this debt in her response to the \nSOR, and stated that she would pay the debt with $796 payments on April 3, 2009 and \nApril 17, 2009. She has not made any payments on the debt. She called the utility \ncompany, but they told her the debt was already transferred to a collection company.19 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is much better than it has been for a number of \nyears. She earns a good salary. She has downsized her lifestyle and expenses. She \nmoved in with friends to save on rent. She drives a modest car. She has been receiving \nfinancial advice from an experienced friend. She has a budget and is saving money to \nuse to pay her debts. She voiced a commitment to pay all her delinquent debts. Her \nplan is to take care of enough of her smaller debts to enable her to obtain a loan that \nshe will use to pay off her largest debts. Her friend who is helping with her finances \ntestified about her efforts at resolving her debts. He stated that she is a responsible, \ntrustworthy person.20 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n18 Tr. at 88-89; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE L, V. \n \n19 Tr. at 89; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n20 Tr. at 93-115; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE U, V, MM. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay her obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved the largest debts alleged in the SOR. Her financial \nissues are ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. Applicant was unemployed for about \nthree months in 2007. She had financial issues related to her separation and divorce. \nThese qualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 \n20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant admitted that her unemployment and divorce were only partly accountable for \nher delinquent debts. Many of the delinquent debts were accrued before she separated \nand before she lost her job. She has begun to act responsibly by addressing her \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant paid or has payment arrangements for a large percentage of the total \nnumber of her delinquent debts. However, she still owes a large percentage of the total \namount owed on her delinquent debts. I find that Applicant acted in good-faith to pay \nsome of her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to the paid debts and the debts \nwith payment arrangements. Because of the amount still owed, I am unable to find AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applicable to all her debts. She has received financial counseling from an \nexperienced friend and there are some indications that her financial problem is being \n\n \n9 \n \nresolved. However, she still has a long way to go before her financial situation can be \nconsidered completely resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and provided \nevidence of her actions to resolve the issues. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts. \nShe provided contradictory evidence about the $13,232 federal tax lien alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. She initially stated to the OPM investigator that she believed the lien was for \nfederal taxes that she owed from 1984, 1985, and 1986; she paid $250 per month for \nabout ten months; and she paid the lien off in May 2005 with money she received when \nshe refinanced her home. She later stated that the lien was in her ex-husband\u2019s name \nfor property taxes and the house was sold in 2006. She stated the IRS and the county \ncourt would not release information about the lien because it was not in her name. \nApplicant was provided the opportunity to provide other evidence that would support her \nposition; specifically, she was asked to provide proof that she had received income tax \nrefunds. She did not do so. I find that Applicant did not submit documented evidence to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute of the federal income tax lien. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not \napplicable to that debt.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant\u2019s \nfinances were adversely affected by her separation, divorce, and unemployment. \nHowever, she had financial problems before any of those events occurred. She has \npaid many of her delinquent debts, but the largest ones remain unresolved. Her \nfinancial situation appears to be headed in the right direction. She is receiving financial \n\n \n10 \n \nadvice from someone with knowledge in that area and has a budget. She has severely \ncurtailed her living expenses to better enable her to pay her debts.  \n \nDespite the positive information, there are lingering concerns. Applicant does not \nhave very many delinquent debts left to pay, but the total amount still owed is in excess \nof $35,000. She made contradictory and inconsistent statements about her finances. \nShe stated that she would pay certain debts at a certain time, and then did not make the \npayments during the period she stated that she would. Two items specifically cause me \nconcern. Applicant listed the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d on her 2007 SF 86. She \ndiscussed going to court for the judgment when she was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in 2007. She stated that she appeared in court and admitted that she owed \nthe money. In July 2008, she certified the accuracy of the ROI that summarized her \ninterview. When she responded to DOHA interrogatories in March 2008, she wrote that \nshe was \u201ctrying to get a loan\u201d to resolve the judgment. Despite all the above, at the \nhearing she testified that she did not remember if she went to court for this matter. That \nstatement is simply not credible.  \n \nThe second item of serious concern is her federal tax lien. Applicant provided \ninconsistent statements about this debt. She initially stated that she believed the lien \nwas for federal taxes that she owed from the mid-1980s, and that she paid $250 per \nmonth for about ten months before she paid the lien off in May 2005 with money she \nreceived when she refinanced her home. At the hearing she stated that was a different \ntax matter and that the tax lien was for property taxes and was purely in her ex-\nhusband\u2019s name. She stated that the IRS and the county court would not give her any \ndocumentation on this matter because it was not in her name. Applicant stated that she \nreceived an income tax refund for tax year 2007. The IRS will normally withhold a \nrefund if a taxpayer owes for a previous year. Applicant was told that proof of a refund \nwould be some evidence that she does not owe the IRS. She did not provide proof of \nany refunds. She wrote that her 2007 tax information is in a box in her storage bin and it \nwould take too long to find it. Proof of resolution of her tax issues would have been very \npositive information in mitigation. Instead, I am left with doubts of the existence of any \nrefunds. The alternative is that Applicant does not care enough to find the proof. In \neither event, based upon the information currently available, her finances remain a \nsecurity concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.n: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.s: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Newman, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 16, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 20, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\n\nThe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant promised at the earlier hearing to surrender his Brazilian passport and\n1\nrenounce his Brazilian citizenship is not a fair reading of the evidence.  Applicant made a conditional commitment to\nundertake those acts if it would make a difference.  There is no indication that anyone communicated to Applicant that\nit would, in fact, make a difference in his case.  The first Judge did not rely on the conditional promises in his favorable\ndecision.  To the extent that Department Counsel\u2019s brief argues for sustaining this finding, it is not well founded.  The\nBoard has frequently noted that conditional promises are entitled to little weight.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-14151\nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2008).\n  \nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an information\ntechnology network administrator employed by a defense contractor.  Born in the U.S. to a U.S.\nfather and a Brazilian mother, he lived in Brazil from age 11 until age 18.  At that time he returned\nto the U.S. to attend college.  After college he lived in Brazil for three years and then returned to the\nU.S., where he has lived ever since.  He married a Brazilian woman in the late 1980s.  She is a legal\nresident of the U.S. and has applied for citizenship.  The couple have two children, both born in the\nU.S.\nIn the late 1990s, DOHA issued a SOR to Applicant, alleging security concerns similar to\nthose at issue here.  The Judge granted Applicant a security clearance.  At the earlier hearing,\nApplicant promised to surrender his Brazilian citizenship and passport.  He attempted to do so in the\nearly 2000s but Brazilian authorities would not permit it.  While holding a U.S. security clearance,\nApplicant has used his Brazilian passport twice.  He is also required by Brazilian law to maintain\nan identification card and to vote in Brazilian elections.  He has voted in Brazilian presidential\nelections since the late 1980s.  \u201cIf he fails to [do so], he will be denied his Brazilian identification\ncard, passport, and driver\u2019s license.\u201d  Decision at 4.   In the Analysis portion of his decision, the\nJudge stated that \u201cApplicant willfully continued to exercise his Brazilian citizenship knowing that\nit raises security concerns . . . Considering the record as a whole, I find Applicant\u2019s behavior\nindicates a preference for Brazil over the United States.\u201d  Id. at 8.  The Judge concluded that\nApplicant had \u201cfailed to mitigate the foreign preference security concern\u201d in his case.  Id. at 11.   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that, with one exception,  the Judge\n1\nexamined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a\n\u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is\nsustainable on this record.

On July 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the government\u2019s security concerns \nunder Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).1 The SOR \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApril 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 16, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 2, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 8, 2008, scheduling a hearing on \nJanuary 21, 2009. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 15, which were \nadmitted without objection (Tr. 33). Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented \nfour exhibits, marked AE 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 40, AE \n4). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 29, 2009. I closed the \nrecord on February 6, 2009.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 e, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 c, \nand 2.e, with one correction and explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.d. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old information technology network administrator working \nfor a defense contractor since 2002 (GE 1). He was born in the United States to a U.S. \nborn father, and Brazilian mother (Tr. 39-40). At age 11, his mother moved back to \nBrazil with Applicant, where he grew up and was educated. From age 18 to 23, \nApplicant lived in the United States and attended college. He received his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1981 (Tr. 6). After college, he returned to Brazil and lived there for three \nyears. He returned to the United States at age 26, and thereafter, he has consistently \nresided in the United States, except for short vacation periods in Brazil. \n \nApplicant did not serve in the Brazilian or U.S. military forces. He explained that \nhe attended a mandatory induction meeting in Brazil, but was excused from military \nservice because of his bad eyesight. He never worked in Brazil or for the Brazilian \ngovernment. In 1987, following his return to the United States from Brazil, Applicant \nstarted working for a U.S. government agency (Tr. 41-44). After a few years he formed \nhis own company and worked as a subcontractor for different U.S. agencies. After his \ncompany went out of business, he was hired by several government contractors. He \nhas had access to classified information at the secret level since 2003 (Tr. 7-10). \n \nApplicant\u2019s Brazilian wife came to the United States as a college student, and \nreceived a master\u2019s degree in contracting (Tr. 67). After college, she was hired by the \nBrazilian Navy to work in the United States as a civilian purchasing agent (Tr. 65). He \n \n2  Applicant was allowed additional time to submit a statement from his Facility Security Officer. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmarried his Brazilian wife in September 1989 (Tr. 65). They have two U.S. born children \nof this marriage: a 15-year-old son, and a 13-year-old daughter. His wife and children \nhave valid Brazilian passports. While working for the Brazilian Navy, she sponsored into \nthe United States a Brazilian live-in nanny. The nanny worked and lived with them from \n2000 to 2008. Since the summer of 2008, the nanny has been living with her boyfriend \nand working during the day for Applicant (Tr. 76).  \n \nAfter leaving that job, his spouse worked for a U.S. private company. In 2006, \nshe was hired by her current employer, a large world organization as a purchasing \nagent. She is a legal foreign resident (green card holder) applying for U.S. citizenship.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 78 years old. She is a retired elementary school \nteacher. His wife communicates with her mother in a weekly basis. She also \ncommunicates with her siblings (two brothers and one sister) at least once a month. \nThey call each other for birthdays and special occasions (Tr. 72). Two of his wife\u2019s \nsiblings are law clerks and work for the Brazilian government (Tr. 70). Her other brother \nis an engineer, currently working for a private corporation in another foreign country. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens and residents of Brazil. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law has \nvisited them approximately four times since their wedding. His brothers-in-law have \nvisited him approximately twice. Applicant\u2019s in-laws and cousins visited and stayed with \nApplicant during the 2008 Christmas season. \n \nWhenever Applicant and his family travel to Brazil they stay with his wife\u2019s family. \nThey have vacationed in Brazil in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, and 2007. He and his family \nplan to travel to Brazil in the summer of 2009 \n \nApplicant\u2019s 82-year-old mother is a Brazilian citizen residing in the United States \n(Tr. 77). She worked for the Brazilian Navy procurement office in the United States and \nin the Brazilian embassy (Tr. 47). In 1987, she was forced to retire (after a car accident) \nfrom her job as an administrative assistant to the Brazilian embassy\u2019s foreign service \noffice (Tr. 78-80). She has worked as a real state agent thereafter. Applicant\u2019s father \nwas U.S. sailor who served during World War II as a gunner in a B-17 (Tr. 45). \nApplicant had little contact with his father after his mother returned to Brazil. \n \nIn 1997, a DOHA administrative judge granted Applicant access to classified \ninformation at the secret level. The security concerns adjudicated then were basically \nthe same Guidelines B and C security concerns alleged in the pending SOR. At his \n1997 hearing, Applicant promised he would surrender his passport and renounce his \nBrazilian citizenship. In 2003, Applicant attempted to surrender his Brazilian passport, \nbut was not allowed to do so. According to Brazil\u2019s law, he cannot renounce his \ncitizenship (Tr. 39, Answer).  \n \nApplicant and his wife have immediate and extended family in Brazil and he feels \nobligated to visit them and to ensure his children know and share with their relatives in \nBrazil. He is willing to renounce his Brazilian citizenship and to surrender his passport, \nbut only if he could use his U.S. passport to travel in and out of Brazil. Because he is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nnot allowed to enter and leave Brazil without his Brazilian passport he renewed his \nBrazilian passport and maintains his Brazilian citizenship. As of January 2009, he had \nnot fully surrendered his passport and had not renounced his Brazilian citizenship. \n \nSince receiving his security clearance in 2003, Applicant used his Brazilian \npassport twice (2005 and 2007) to travel to Brazil (Tr. 52). He traveled to four other \nforeign countries and always used his U.S. passport. According to his facility security \nofficer (FSO), Applicant has complied with all security rules and regulations. To \nminimize the security concerns raised by his possession of a Brazilian passport, in \n2003, he surrendered his passport to his FSO for safekeeping (Tr. 50). Applicant also \nhas consistently reported all foreign contacts to his FSO in person and by email. \nFurthermore, he has notified his FSO of any upcoming foreign trips, and provided his \nFSO with trip reports at the conclusion of each trip. The FSO submitted incident reports \nthrough JPAS to account for Applicant\u2019s use of his Brazilian passport and the \ncircumstances of the foreign trips (AE 4). \n \nIn 2005, Applicant travelled to Brazil without his passport. He was allowed to \nenter Brazil with his Brazilian identification card. However, to depart Brazil, he was \nforced to renew his passport. It will expire in August 2010 (Tr. 63). Applicant is also \nrequired to maintain a valid Brazilian identification card (which he updated at age 30) \n(Tr. 53), and to vote in Brazil\u2019s presidential elections (Tr. 62). He complies with Brazilian \nlaws and has consistently voted in Brazil\u2019s presidential elections since 1987. He casts \nhis vote at the Brazilian embassy in the United States. He intends to vote in future \nBrazilian presidential elections to be able to maintain his passport. If he fails to vote in \nBrazilian presidential elections, he will be denied his Brazilian identification card, \npassport, and driver\u2019s license. Applicant also maintains a valid Brazilian driver\u2019s license \nto be able to rent cars and drive in Brazil. He renewed his driver\u2019s license in 2007 (Tr. \n59). \n \n \nIn 2007, to minimize his possession of the Brazilian passport he attempted to \nstore it at the U.S. embassy in Brazil while he was in country. The embassy refused to \nhold his Brazilian passport (AE 4, Tr. 52). He plans to use his Brazilian passport when \nhe visits Brazil with his family in the summer of 2009 (Tr. 63). \n \n \nApplicant considers himself to be a loyal, trustworthy, and patriotic American. He \nbelieves he has complied with all the security conditions imposed on him to account for \nhis foreign passport and his foreign trips. Having lived in a foreign country, he \nunderstands the privilege of living in the United States with constitutional rights and \nprotections. Applicant stated he has no proprietary, economic or financial interests \noutside of the United States (Tr. 82). He owns a home in the United States with an \nestimated value of $1 million. He also has approximately $100,000 in a retirement \naccount and other investments (Tr. 84). He and his family are active members of their \ncommunity. He has voted in all U.S. local and national elections since 1987 (Tr. 84). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented two reference letters, one from the president \nof his company, who has known and observed him during the last 11 years, and the \nsecond from his supervisor, who has known and observed him during the last 7 years. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nBoth consider Applicant to be the consummate professional, loyal, trustworthy, reliable, \nand to display good judgment (AEs 2 and 3).  \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The government of Brazil is a \ncharter member of the Organization of American States and a historical economic \ntrading partner of the U.S. Brazil has a democratic government and is generally reputed \nto be committed to the rule of law and the upholding of human rights. The Government \npresented no evidence addressing security concerns about Brazil\u2019s economic and \npolitical status, or its human rights record. There is no evidence the government of \nBrazil engages in the gathering of U.S. sensitive economic, industrial, or proprietary \ninformation. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) Applicant may be disqualified for the \u201cexercise of any right, \nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1): \npossession of a current foreign passport, (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, \nsocial welfare, or other such benefits, and (7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d  \n \nApplicant was born in the United States to a U.S. born father and Brazilian \nmother. As such, he is a dual U.S. and Brazilian citizen. As of the day of his hearing, he \npossessed a valid Brazilian passport, a Brazilian identification card, and a valid drivers \nlicense. Since 1987, he has voted in all Brazilian national elections, as required by \nBrazilian law. AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), (3), and (7) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that could mitigate the foreign preference \nsecurity concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States and lived here until age 11 when his \nmother relocated to Brazil. He returned to the United States to attend college, and \nreceived his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in the United States. He then returned to \nBrazil for three years. He has made the United States his home since age 26, and has \nworked for U.S. government contractors or U.S. agencies most of his life. He has \nworked hard for government contractors earning their trust. There is no evidence he has \never taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States, or that he \nlacks honesty and integrity. \n \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s financial and economic ties are in the United States. He has no \nother financial, economic, or proprietary interests in any foreign country. Applicant\u2019s \nquestionable actions (voting in Brazilian elections and possessing a valid Brazilian \npassport, identification card and driver\u2019s license), were compelled by Brazil\u2019s laws. \n \n \nApplicant surrendered his Brazilian passport to his FSO and conscientiously \nreports any contact with foreigners, provides advance notice of his foreign trips, and \nsubmits a trip report to his FSO. He only uses his Brazilian passport to travel to Brazil. \nHe uses his U.S. passport to travel for any other foreign travel. He attempted to \nrenounce his Brazilian citizenship and to surrender his passport in 2003, but was \ninformed that such action is prohibited under Brazilian law.  \n \n \nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) partially apply, but do not fully mitigate the foreign \npreference security concerns. In his 1997 DOHA hearing, Applicant was informed of the \nsecurity concerns raised by his exercise of his dual citizenship. Since his 1997 DOHA \nhearing, Applicant has repeatedly expressed a willingness to renounce his Brazilian \ncitizenship. Notwithstanding, he has not effectuated this offer. To the contrary, since \n1997 he has renewed his Brazilian passport, his Brazilian driver\u2019s license, voted in \nBrazilian elections, and has continued to use his Brazilian identification card. Moreover, \nApplicant intends to continue exercising his Brazilian citizenship in the future. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant willfully continued to exercise his Brazilian citizenship knowing that it \nraises security concerns and that it would affect his ability to hold a security clearance. \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find Applicant\u2019s behavior indicates a preference for \nBrazil over the United States. Considering his past behavior, Applicant\u2019s mere offers to \nrenounce his Brazilian citizenship fail to mitigate the foreign preference security \nconcerns. \n \n \nFor the same reasons outlined in the preceding paragraphs, I find that \nApplicant\u2019s surrendering his Brazilian passport to his FSO, informing the government of \nfuture travel plans to Brazil, and providing trip reports of his whereabouts while in Brazil, \ndo not fully mitigate his exercise of Brazilian citizenship and the foreign preference \nsecurity concerns. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a persona or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his extended family members and his in-\nlaws who are Brazilian citizens residing in Brazil. The closeness of the relationship is \nshown by Applicant\u2019s frequent telephone contacts with them, directly or through his wife, \nhis frequent travels and vacationing in Brazil where he stays with his in-laws, and his in-\nlaws visits to Applicant in the United States. He expressed feeling of affection and or \nobligation for his extended family members and in-laws. \n \nThis contact creates a possible risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Brazilian agents may exploit the opportunity \nto obtain sensitive or classified U.S. information. The government produced substantial \nevidence raising these three potentially disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted \nto Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U. \nS.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n                                                     \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant does have a strong bond of affection and obligation toward his \nBrazilian extended family members. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nBrazilian family members do not raise a heightened risk of foreign exploitation. \nConsidering the record as a whole -- Brazil\u2019s form of government, its relationship with \nthe United States, and that Brazil has no history of collecting sensitive information from \nthe United States, the possibility of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation is \nsubstantially diminished. It is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of his family in Brazil and the U.S. interests. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n(b ) and (e) apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a loyal and proud American. Except for approximately 10 years he \nlived in Brazil (from age 11 to 18), he has lived in the United States all his life. Available \nevidence suggests he has been a valuable employee of several government agencies \nand numerous government contractor providing important services for government \nagencies. There is no evidence Applicant has ever compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action \nwhich could cause potential harm to the United States, or that he lacks honesty and \nintegrity.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nOn balance, there are more substantial circumstances that weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis. Applicant is exercising the rights and privileges \nof a Brazilian citizen. Moreover, he intends to continue doing so in the future. He has \nnumerous family members in Brazil for whom he has feelings of affection and or \nobligation. Applicant is more concerned about his vacation trips and maintaining his \nfamily contacts in Brazil than about the security concerns raised by his behavior. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s overall behavior raises a \nsignificant doubt about his preference for Brazil over the United States. \u201cBecause of the \nextreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption against granting a \nsecurity clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it is deemed best to err on the \nside of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] \nclearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns, but failed to mitigate foreign preference security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Duffy, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 24, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn July 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 9, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 19, 2008. Applicant did not file\na response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 12, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn August 1997, and again in March 1998, applicant was arrested and charged\nwith Alcohol Possession by a Person Under 21. On both occasions he pleaded nolo\ncontendere and adjudication was withheld.\nIn November 1997, applicant was charged with Driving While Drivers License\nSuspended. He was found guilty.\nIn March 1999, applicant was arrested and charged with three crimes involving\nthe sale of drugs (felony), evidence tampering (felony), and resisting an officer without\nviolence (misdemeanor). Adjudication was withheld for six months, during which time\napplicant was on probation. If applicant had served his probation without incident, the\ncharges would have been dismissed. However, the charges were not dismissed\nbecause applicant violated the terms of his probation when he was arrested in August\n1999 (discussed below). \nIn August 1999, applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of a\nControlled Substance Without a Prescription, a felony. He pleaded nolo contendere,\nwas placed on probation for three years, and was ordered to pay court costs. He\nviolated the terms of this probation when he was arrested in 2000 (discussed below).\nIn 2000, applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While Drivers License\nSuspended/Cancelled/Revoked. He was found guilty. Based on the guilty finding and\nhis probation violation, he was sentenced to home confinement for six months.\nIn September 2003, applicant was arrested and charged with DUI Alcohol or\nDrugs 1  Offense. In October 2003, he was found guilty, fined, placed on probation for\nst\n12 months, and ordered to attend DUI school.\nIn September 2006, applicant was arrested and charged with Resist Officer-\nObstructions W/O Violence. In October 2006, he pleaded no contest, adjudication was\nwithheld, he was placed on probation for 6 months, and he was ordered to pay court\ncosts.\nDuring an interview with an OPM investigator in September 2007, applicant\nstated that his criminal conduct was the result of associating with the wrong people. He\nfurther stated that he has not used drugs since 1999, and no longer associates with\ndrug users.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n\n3\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 31.c., \u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.e., \u201cviolation of\nparole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program\u201d may\nbe disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple criminal convictions, multiple crimes for which there\n\n4\nwas no formal conviction because adjudication was withheld, and his two violations of\nprobation, raise these disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Under Paragraph 32.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under Paragraph 32.d., it may be\nmitigating if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d Applicant\u2019s last criminal conduct occurred about two years ago, which is a\npositive sign. However, because he twice went more than two years between crimes\nduring his period of criminal activity between 1997 and 2006, these two years, by\nthemselves, do not support a finding that his criminal activity will not recur. This fact,\ntogether with applicant\u2019s failure to offer any positive evidence of reform and\nrehabilitation from independent sources who know him well (e.g., family, friends,\ncoworkers, supervisors), preclude application of either mitigating condition.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a relatively young\nman when his criminal activity began, but it continued well into his twenties. He\nvoluntarily engaged in this conduct, which occurred over a period of about ten years.\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d record during the last two years is a positive sign, as is his statement\nthat he no longer associates with drug users. But, in the absence of any credible\nindependent evidence that suggests he is unlikely to engage in criminal conduct or\nexercise such poor judgment in the future, this evidence is insufficient to support a\nfinding that his criminal conduct and poor judgment are unlikely to recur. Accordingly,\napplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline J.\n\n5\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance\nis denied.\nApplicant requested a security clearance by in submitting an Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on December 6, 2006. Because of an administrative\nNovember 18, 2008\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n \n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply\nto all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\n2\nproblem, he was required to re-submit it, which he did on February 21, 2007. After reviewing\nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that\n1\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn June 24, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), which\nspecified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive under\nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).2\nApplicant received the SOR on July 21, 2008. He signed his Answer on July 29,\n2008, in which he admitted to the following SOR allegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1f under\nGuideline H. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, which addresses the time frame of his marijuana use;\nand 2.a, which alleges that he deliberately falsified information he provided on his security\nclearance questionnaire. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 28, 2008, and the case\nwas assigned to me on September 3. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 1, 2008\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 21, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, the government offered two exhibits, Government Exhibit (GE)\n1 and 2, which were received without objection. Applicant testified, and offered one exhibit,\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was received without objection as well. I held the record\nopen to allow Applicant to submit an additional document. It was timely received, and\nforwarded without objection by Department Counsel. The document was entered as AE B.\nDOHA received the transcript on October 30, 2008, and the record closed on that day.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant, 54 years old, graduated high school and completed several college\ncourses (Tr. 5). He married in 1989, and divorced in 2006. He has one daughter who is 17\nyears of age. Applicant has worked for the same defense contractor for the past 36 years\n\n3\n(GE 1). His current position is Designer/Drafter. His first security clearance was granted in\n1972, and he held it until approximately the mid-1980s (Tr. 27).\nApplicant began using marijuana in 1971, while attending high school, at the age of\n17 (Tr. 26). He used it \u201cpractically daily\u201d (Tr 26), buying the drug from friends and other\npeople he knew (Tr. 48). Applicant describes his habit as \u201c...a chronic habit. I freely admit\nthat. It was a serious habit.\u201d (Tr. 26). Applicant was granted his first security clearance in\n1972. It was discontinued for administrative reasons around 1985. During the 13 years that\nhe held his first security clearance, Applicant used marijuana daily (Tr. 27-29). Applicant\nalso admits that he had a \u201cmental and physical dependency\u201d on marijuana during the period\n1993 to 2003. Given his long-standing marijuana use, Applicant decided not to re-apply for\na security clearance (Tr. 36).\nIn approximately 1992, Applicant was diagnosed with glaucoma (Tr. 63). Applicant\nbelieves that marijuana temporarily reduces internal pressure on the eye, and at the time,\nhe considered this medical benefit justified using the drug. Since stopping his marijuana\nuse, he has discovered a medication that will accomplish the same effect (Tr. 31). He listed\nhis glaucoma diagnosis on his Security Clearance Application to explain why he continued\nto use marijuana at such a mature age. Applicant testified that he would have used\nmarijuana regardless of whether he had glaucoma (Tr. 33-34). Applicant also used cocaine\na few times between May and June of 2002 (GE 1). \nThrough his company\u2019s Employee and Family Assistance Program, Applicant was\nreferred for drug treatment in 2003 (Tr. 59). From November 2003 until July 2004, Applicant\nparticipated in and completed an intensive treatment program, involving 12 weeks of group\ntherapy, with four-hour sessions three times per week. The first 12 weeks were followed by\nan 18-week period of one-hour sessions once per week. He did not use marijuana during\ntreatment, but did resume his daily use after completing the program. He continued using\nuntil April 2006 (Tr. 41-42), when he stopped using marijuana. He relapsed and used it once\non December 31, 2006. He has not used marijuana since that date (Tr. 21).\nApplicant used marijuana throughout his marriage. Although his wife was aware of\nhis use, he kept the habit hidden from his daughter for many years (Tr. 35). In 2006,\nApplicant and his wife divorced. Because his wife worked nights, and their 15-year-old\ndaughter still required parental guidance, they agreed that it would best if he took custody\n(Tr. 44). The realization that he would have primary custody, and the belief that he needed\nto set a good example for his daughter, motivated him to end his marijuana use (Tr. 43).\nSince that time, he has disclosed his drug history to his daughter (Tr. 49).\nAfter  Applicant completed his Security Clearance Application on December 6, 2006,\nhis company closed for the holiday season (Tr. 22). When it re-opened, he completed his\nfinger-printing, but it was discovered that his Security Clearance Application and his\nfingerprint record were not done within the necessary 30-day window. Therefore, he was\nrequired to re-submit his application. In February 2007, Applicant rushed to re-sbumit the\ndocument, re-entering the same information into the computer program that he had entered\nthe first time (Tr. 54). In between his two submissions, Applicant used marijuana once on\n\nDirective. 6.3.\n3 \n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n4\nDecember 31, 2006, after having abstained since the previous April. When he re-submitted\nthe second Application, he failed to update the question regarding drug use to add his last\nuse in December 2006. He always considered April 2006 as the date that he ended his\nlong-standing drug use (Tr. 23).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nIn this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require\nconsideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline\nH (drug involvement) and Guideline E (personal conduct).  \n          A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue\n4\nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to\nprove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then\nfalls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or his own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable\ndoubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.6\n\n5\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise \nquestions \nabout an \nindividual's \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe facts raise three disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) and AG\n\u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply based on Applicant\u2019s\npurchase, possession and use of marijuana for more than 35 years. AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance) also applies. Applicant was granted his\nfirst security clearance in 1972 and held it until approximately 1985. During the 13 years\nthat he held his first security clearance, Applicant used marijuana daily (Tr. 27-28).\nGuideline H also provides four mitigating conditions, two of which are relevant here.\nAG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) cannot be applied. Applicant\u2019s last\nuse of marijuana was slightly less than two years ago, which is not distant in time. When\ncombined with the fact that he used marijuana daily for more than three decades, I cannot\nconfidently predict that his current abstention will continue. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is also relevant:\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation\nAG \u00b6 26(b)(3) applies to some extent because Applicant has abstained from using\nmarijuana for almost two years. However, his recent avoidance of marijuana must be\nweighed against more than 35 years of use which he himself characterizes as dependence\n\n6\n(Tr. 45). His long record of illegal drug use outweighs the comparatively short length of his\nabstention.\nApplicant\u2019s signed statement (AE B) attesting that he will not use illegal drugs in the\nfuture, under penalty of losing any security clearance granted to him, implicates AG \u00b6 26\n(b)(4). However, Applicant qualified his intent to abstain from using marijuana. In his signed\nstatement and in his testimony, he states that he will not use an illegal drug while holding\na security clearance; he did not state that he would abstain if he were not granted a\nsecurity clearance. The question remains open whether or not Applicant would engage in\nillegal drug use if he does not obtain a clearance. Moreover, in his testimony, Applicant\nstated that if marijuana use were legalized for the treatment of glaucoma, \u201cI really cannot\ncategorically state here today that I would not take advantage of that.\u201d(Tr. 63). His\nstatements, taken together, indicate an underlying desire to be able to return to marijuana\nuse. Applicant fails to demonstrate a complete commitment to avoiding marijuana. Given\nthese facts, AG \u00b6 26 (b) (3) and (4) are insufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s disqualifying\nconduct.\nPersonal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe government alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his December\n2006 marijuana use, implicating AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).\nApplicant failed to list marijuana use on December 31, 2006, indicating on his\nSecurity Clearance Application that his last use was in April 2006. He testified that he has\nalways considered April 2006 as the date that he stopped using marijuana. AG \u00b6 17(c)\n(the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) mitigates\nApplicant\u2019s omission of the December 2006 marijuana use. His failure to include the single\nuse of marijuana in December 2006 was infrequent, since no other material facts were\nomitted. In fact, Applicant disclosed the most serious negative fact \u2013 his continuous\nmarijuana use over a period of 35 years\u2013 showing that he did not intend to hide relevant\n\n7\ninformation from the government. Nor did he try to minimize his drug use, even\ngoing so far as to describe it as \u201cchronic\u201d in his security clearance application. Applicant\ncompleted his re-submission in a hurry, and admits that he should have listed the\nDecember use. But considering his disclosure of the extent and nature of his illegal drug\nuse, as well as his disclosure of other facts against his own interest, such as an arrest for\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol and a brief use of cocaine, I find that Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to list the additional use in December 2006 is mitigated because it was not\nintentional.\nWhole Person Analysis  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. \nApplicant voluntary decided to use an illegal drug for more than 35 years. He did\nnot discontinue his use until approximately two years ago, when he was a mature adult\nof 52 years. Although it is commendable that he has abstained from using marijuana for\nalmost two years, Applicant\u2019s past drug use has resulted in poor judgment and\nuntrustworthy behavior: he hid his illegal drug use from his daughter; he used marijuana\nfor 13 years while he held a security clearance; for the past 25 years, he avoided applying\nfor a security clearance because he preferred to use an illegal drug. Finally, his intent to\navoid future use is not unequivocal. His recent abstinence is insufficient to overcome his\nextensive history of drug use, and his resulting untrustworthy behavior.\nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline H\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f::\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to\nclassified information.

On July 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines B,\nC and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR. He answered the SOR in writing on August 13,\n2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the\nFebruary 6, 2009\n\nThe government withdrew GE 10 at the hearing.\n1\n2  \nrequest on August 14, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August\n30, 2008, and I received the case assignment on September 4, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on October 1, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October\n16, 2008. At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a continuance in order to obtain\nan interpreter for Applicant and his witness. I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay.\nDOHA issued a second notice of hearing on November 10, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on December 9, 2008. The government offered two exhibits (GE)\n1 and 2, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\nand one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted one exhibit (AE) D, which was\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on December 17, 2008. I held the record open until December 31,\n2008, to submit additional matters.  On December 30, 2008, Applicant submitted AE E,\nwhich was admitted without objection. On January 23, 2009, I conducted a telephone\nconference call with both counsel. I requested one additional document from Applicant,\nwhich was received on February 3, 2009 and admitted without objection as AE F. The\ngovernment\u2019s response to this submission is marked and admitted as GE 15. The\nrecord closed on February 3, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Cuba and Columbia.  In addition, Applicant also asked that I\ntake administrative notice of certain facts relating to Cuba. (Tr. 9-10) The requests and\nthe attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the\nrecord as GE 3 through 9 and 11 through 14,  and AE A through C. The facts\n1\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 13, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 2.a, and 2.c through 2.g of the SOR, with explanations.\nHe denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. 2.b and 3.a of the SOR. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\n  \nApplicant, who is 60 years old, was born in Cuba prior to Fidel Castro\u2019s rise to\npower in 1959. He works in a security position for a Department of Defense contractor,\na position he has held for the last three years. He has worked as a security officer in\nprivate industry since 1998. He worked as a jeweler for many years, but he retired from\nthis profession when problems with his eyesight developed. English is his second\nlanguage, and as such, idioms, colloquial expressions and certain general terminology\n\nBecause English is his second language, he testified through an interpreter at the hearing. He does\n2\nunderstand and speak English. Tr. 27, 62-63.\nAlthough Applicant belongs to an organization for political prisoners, he is no longer active in the organization.\n3\nAE E; Id. 20-21, 49-51.\nId. 21-23, 52-53.\n4\nId. 22-23, 32, 39-42; GE 1 (e-QIP) at 18-19.\n5\n3  \nare not necessarily understood because the Spanish language does not contain words\nwith the same meaning. 2\nIn 1966, at age 18, Applicant entered the Cuban Army, as required by Cuban\nlaw. He achieved the rank of Third Class Sergeant. While in the Army, he and several\nfriends, who opposed the Fidel Castro government, took weapons and maps of secret\nhiding places for those in power (in the event of an American invasion) with the goal of\ngiving this information to the American government. A member of their group informed\nthe Cuban government of their activities. Initially, his friends were arrested, but he\nescaped. He returned to his parents home, where he remained until he was arrested.\nThe Cuban government tried Applicant and his friends in a military court for rebellion,\ndesertion, and ideological diversion, but took no action against his parents. The court\nsentenced him to eight years in prison as a political prisoner. After he served four years\nof his sentence, the Cuban government paroled him for good conduct. Since his\nrelease, he has not had any contact with these friends. Under Cuban governmental\npolicy or law, the Cuban government could still return him to jail to serve the remaining\nfour years of his sentence and if it chose to do so, could possibly detain him beyond this\ntime.3\nAfter his release from jail, Applicant worked in construction and attended a\nBaptist seminary trade school. He quit the seminary school before completing his\ntraining, when he realized that should an opportunity to leave Cuba arise in the future,\nhe would not be allowed to leave Cuba because he had completed his schooling. In\n1978, after American news stories, the Cuban government decided to allow former or\npresent political prisoners and their families to leave Cuba. Applicant decided to leave\nCuba under this program. He entered the United States (U.S.) in 1980 with a Cuban\npassport, which expired many years ago. His parents and brother remained in Cuba.4\nApplicant\u2019s first wife and three children, two sons and a daughter, came with him\nto the U.S. in 1980. They continue to live in the U.S.  His children are now adults. He\nand his first wife divorced in 1991 and he has no contact with her or her extended\nfamily. He married his present wife in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen the same year.\nHis daughter recently became a U.S. citizen. He does not know if his sons are U.S.\ncitizens. He talks with his daughter regularly. He has not spoken with his oldest son in\nseven years and could not remember when he last spoke with his younger son.5\n\nTr. 25-26, 55, 59, 61.\n6\nAE F; AE G; Tr. 23-24, 29, 37.\n7\nTr. 23, 25-27, 46, 55-56.\n8\nId. 24, 26, 49-50; GE 1, supra note 5, at 25. Applicant also traveled to Canada in 2005. Id., Tr. at 27.        \n9\n  \n \n4  \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Columbia, South America. She is a permanent\nresident of the U.S., but still a citizen of Columbia. Her two sons are citizens and\nresidents of Columbia, South America, working in private industry. Her daughter resides\nin England and is a housewife. Her father, brother and sisters are citizens and residents\nof Columbia. When Applicant and his wife married, her children and his children were\nemancipated adults. He does not consider his wife\u2019s children his stepchildren. He does\nnot talk with his wife\u2019s children or other family members although his wife does talk with\nher family by telephone periodically. He provides no financial support to her family. Her\nfamily members are not connected to the Columbian government or military. Applicant\u2019s\nwife is currently on disability from work, but plans to return to the work place.6\nSince 1999, the U.S. has allowed limited travel to Cuba, including travel to visit\nwith family members. In 1999, after 19 years in the U.S., Applicant decided to travel to\nCuba to visit his elderly parents. He hired a travel agency to make travel arrangements\nfor him. During this process, he learned that the Cuban government required all Cubans\nwho had left Cuba after December 31, 1970 to obtain a Cuban passport. The Cuban\ngovernment considered all these expatriates Cuban citizens and would not permit any\nof these individuals to enter Cuba on a foreign passport. Instead, Cuba required all\nexpatriates who sought to enter Cuba to obtain a Cuban passport for admittance. With\nthe help of the travel agency, Applicant obtained a Cuban passport, which was valid for\ntwo years and renewed for another year. He and his wife, but not his children, traveled\nto Cuba for one week in March 2000. They stayed with his family members while in\nCuba. He recently attempted to submit his expired Cuban passport to his security office,\nbut the company declined to accept his expired passport as did the agency which\nobtained the passport.  \n7\nApplicant and his wife also traveled to Columbia, South America in March 2000\nto visit her family, including her sons. Applicant met his wife\u2019s family for the first and only\ntime on this trip. Applicant has not returned to Columbia, although his wife returned 15\nmonths ago. He and his wife also traveled to Europe in September 2000 to visit her\ndaughter and for pleasure.8\nApplicant traveled to Cuba a second time in 2002 to visit his elderly parents. He\nhas not returned to Cuba and does not intend to travel to Cuba again, as he feels\nuncomfortable when in Cuba. He continues to fear he could be arrested and returned to\njail. The Cuban passport he used to enter Cuba for this trip expired in June 2003 and\nhas not been renewed.9\n\nGE 1, supra note 5, at 17, 18, 20; Tr. 36-39, 43-45.\n10\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and answers with attachments) at 32; Tr. 48, 59-60.\n11\n5  \nApplicant\u2019s elderly parents are citizens of and reside in Cuba. Applicant\u2019s parents\ndivorced in 1960. Both have remarried. His 92-year-old father retired after working 40\nyears in a cigar factory, which is owed by the Cuban government. He receives a\npension. His wife is still alive.  Applicant\u2019s mother, who is 84 years-old, worked in the\nsame cigar factory as his father for 20 years. She is retired, but does not receive a\npension. She depends upon her husband, a retired farmer, for income. With the Cuban\ngovernment\u2019s permission, Applicant\u2019s mother traveled once to the U.S. in 1982. No\nother family member has traveled to the U.S. Applicant\u2019s brother is 64 years old and a\nretired art historian. He assumes his brother gets a pension from the Cuban\ngovernment, but Applicant does not know about the pension for certain. Applicant\nspeaks by telephone, his only means of communication, with his parents every two or\nthree months.  He spoke with his brother about one month ago. He believes that the\nCuban government listens to his telephone conversations. His parents know he is a\nsecurity officer, but do not know where he works. He sends each of his parents $125\ntwo or three times a year. His family in Cuba has never been in prison. His children do\nnot have any contact with their Cuban grandparents.10\nApplicant holds an active U.S. passport, which he uses to travel out of and into\nthe U.S. Since becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has purchased property, paid taxes,\nand voted in every U.S. election. He considers himself a U.S. citizen, not a Cuban\ncitizen. He is proud to be an American citizen and would assist in the overthrow of the\nCuban government. He has no allegiance to Cuba or Columbia. He did not receive any\nservices from the Cuban government during his two visits. He does not own any\nproperty in Cuban nor does he have any bank accounts in Cuba. He will not inherit any\nproperty or anything else from his parents. He does not have any performance\nproblems on his job.  \n11\nIn 2007, Applicant completed his first security clearance application by hand\nseveral months before the completion of his e-QIP and gave it to his employer. He\nprovided an undated and unsigned of copy this document at the hearing. His electronic\ncopy was completed on June 12, 2007 by his security officer with some assistance from\nhim and based on the information provided to the security officer in his hand written\nsecurity application. The e-QIP contained a notation under the certification that his\nsignature was on file. On a separate page, Applicant signed the certification about the\ntruthfulness of his answers on June 12, 2007. In the e-QIP, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nquestion 17 d: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had an active passport that was issued by\na foreign government?\u201d In his hand written application, he answered \u201cyes\u201d and listed all\nhis trips abroad since 2000, except his trip to Cuba in 2002. He listed all his foreign trips\non his e-QIP. Applicant listed dual citizenship with Cuba on his e-QIP and his\nhandwritten application. The e-QIP also contains other minor, non-contradictory\ninformation not on the hand written application. Applicant explained that his employer\ncompleted the eQIP, but he could not explain how the e-QIP had additional information\n\nAE D (hand written security clearance application); GE 1, supra note 5; Tr. 29-32, 58.\n12\nTr. 67-73.\n13\n6  \nnot contained in his hand written application. He denies trying to intentionally deceive\nthe government about the existence of his Cuban passport. He did not read the e-QIP\nonce it was completed, but acknowledges that he signed it. It is unclear as to how the\nemployer obtained the information contained in the e-QIP, although Applicant testified\nthat he provided his prior employer with information about his travels abroad before he\ntraveled. Applicant also testified to some misunderstanding about having dual\ncitizenship with Cuba. He never asked for dual citizenship, but was told he needed a\nCuban passport to enter Cuban. He found this situation confusing.12\nA friend testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf through a translator. Applicant\u2019s friend is\nalso Cuban born and immigrated to the U.S. in 1978. He has known Applicant for 12 to\n15 years as they are members of the same church. He has returned to Cuba three\ntimes and had to acquire a Cuban passport to enter Cuba. He has not received any\npapers from the U.S. government to go to Cuba. He recommends Applicant for a\nposition of trust as Applicant would never help the Cuban or Columbian government.13\nColumbia\nColumbia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy with extensive strategic ties to\nthe United States. Columbian citizens enjoy rights similar to U.S. citizens. International\nobservers described the May 2006 elections as free and fair, despite efforts by terrorist\ngroups to interfere in the election process.\nIn the past, Columbia had significant internal problems because of the powerful\ndrug cartels. With strong support from the U.S., the drug cartel problems have been\nreduced. The citizens of Columbia and other countries face serious threats from terrorist\nand paramilitary organizations within Columbia, but not the Columbian government. The\nU.S. is fully committed to supporting the Columbian government in its efforts to defeat\nColumbian-based Foreign Terrorist Organizations. In recent years, Columbia has\nexpanded its role as a regional leader in counter-terrorism. \nThe Columbian government cooperates with U.S. and international organizations\non human rights issues. Despite this fact, arrests of suspected terrorists and\nparamilitary can lead to human rights violations for these detainees. In Columbia,\nhuman rights violations are often committed, not by the government, but by terrorist\norganizations. In response to these problems, the Columbian government successfully\nimproved human rights and security issues, for example a reduction in massacres and\nkidnaping, through effective law enforcement supported by an active judiciary. Again,\nthrough effective judicial decisions, the prosecutors successfully investigated and\nprosecuted links between politicians and paramilitary groups. \n\n7  \nCuba\nIn 1902, Spain granted Cuba its independence. Since 1959, Cuba has been a\ntotalitarian state. Cuba is a multiracial society, which is primarily urban. Constitutional\nrights, such as freedom of speech and right to a fair trial, enjoyed by American citizens\nare not enjoyed by Cuban citizens. Cuba views Cuban-born American citizens as Cuban\ncitizens only.\nThe Cuban government controls the life of its citizens. It retains control through\nintense physical and electronic surveillance. The Cuban government can harass its\ncitizens for contacts with Americans. Human rights abuses occur, particularly with those\narrested, detained and imprisoned, and imprisonment for political reasons continues.\nThe U.S. continues the broad embargo established in the 1960s against trading\nwith Cuba and continues to prohibit most commercial imports from Cuba. Between 1989\nand 1993, the Cuban gross national product declined by 35% following the loss of\nSoviet era subsidies. The Cuban economy is still recovering and is controlled by the\nstate. In addition, the military plays a dominant role in the economy. Cuba currently\nseeks to grow its economy, partially through tourism.\nThe U.S. considers Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism. Cuba has long targeted\nthe U.S. for intensive espionage activities. With the loss of Soviet subsidies, Cuba has\nabandoned monetary support for guerilla movements although it still maintains relations\nwith several guerrilla and terrorist groups, sometimes providing refuge in Cuba for\nmembers of these groups.\nIn 1999, the U.S. opened travel to Cuba, including allowing Cuban-Americans to\ntravel back to Cuba to visit family members. The new travel rules are governed by The\nCuban Assets Control Regulations, which are enforced by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment. These regulations require all U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba to get a\nlicense. Visits to family members in Cuba require a specific license and the number of\ntrips is limited. In addition, persons in the U.S. can send up to $300 every quarter to\nfamily members in  the same household.\nUnder recent U.S. policy, the U.S. presses for political, economic and democratic\nchange in the Cuban lifestyle.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the DOHA  Appeal Board. The Appeal\n14\nBoard\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are met:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE3.1.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing they have no opportunity\nto observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States v. Raddatz,\n447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . . give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of \u201cthe administrative agency.\n8  \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n14\n\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommending remand of cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008).\n9  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry;\n\nThe government concedes that his invalid passport fulfills this mitigating condition. GE 15.\n15\n10  \nWhen the U.S. changed its policy and allowed Cuban-Americans to travel to\nCuban to visit family members, Applicant decided to visit his elderly parents. Because\nCuban considers all Cubans who left Cuba after December 31, 1970 citizens of Cuba\nonly regardless of their current citizenship, it requires all Cuban expatiates to obtain a\nCuban passport to enter Cuba. Applicant obtained a new Cuban passport in 1999\nbefore he traveled to Cuban in 2000. He renewed the passport once, prior to a second\ntrip to Cuba in 2002. His Cuban passport expired in June 2003. He acknowledged dual\ncitizenship with Cuba when completing his security clearance application. A security\nconcern has been raised in disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). However, because\nApplicant served in the Cuban military as a young man and prior to becoming a U.S.\ncitizen,  AG \u00b6(a) (2) does not apply.\nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from Foreign Preference. The following Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions\n(FP MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case.\nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\na foreign country) does not appy.\nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship) partially applies. Although he did not expressly offer to formally renounce\nhis Cuban citizenship, Applicant does not consider himself a citizen of Cuban. He\nindicated he had dual citizenship with Cuba because Cuba considers him a citizen of\nCuba. He does not consider himself to be a dual citizen of Cuba. He has no interest in\nCuban citizenship and his only allegiance is to the U.S.\nBecause Applicant obtained a Cuban passport, mitigating condition, FP MC \u00b6\n11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred\nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor), does\nnot apply. His past military service does not raise a security concern.  \nFP MC \u00b6 11(d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority) is not applicable to the facts of this case. \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies. Applicant did not renew his Cuban\npassport after it expired in 2003. Thus, he has not held a valid Cuban passport for\nalmost six years. He does not intend to travel to Cuba in the future, particularly since he\nfears that the Cuban government could return him to jail. He supported his statement\nabout his intent by attempting to submit his invalid passport to his security office.15\nFP MC \u00b6 11(f) (the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United\nStates Government) is not applicable because there is nothing in the record evidence\nsuggesting Applicant voted in a foreign election. \n\n11  \nApplicant mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns about use of his passport.\nApplicant lives in the U.S. and does not intend to return to Cuba or to serve in the\nCuban Army. He would assist in the overthrow of the Cuban government. Since\nbecoming a U.S. citizen, he has voted in U.S. elections, paid taxes, and purchased\nproperty in the U.S. He considers himself a U.S. citizen and not a Cuban citizen. He has\nexercised his rights of U.S. citizenship and has shown a preference to the U.S.\nGuideline C is found for Applicant.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nSince his divorce, Applicant has not had any contact with his former wife and her\nfamily living in Cuba. Thus, no security concern is raised by any contacts his former wife\nmay have with her family. His former wife continues to live in the U.S. His adult\ndaughter is a citizen and resident of the U.S. His adult sons are long-time residents of\nthe U.S., although they may still be citizens of Cuba. While his wife is still a citizen of\nColumbia, she is a permanent resident of the U.S. and resides with Applicant in the U.S.\nThus, these relationships are not a security concern. However, Applicant\u2019s parents and\nbrother are citizens and residents of Cuba. Applicant maintains a normal, but limited,\nfamilial relationship with his parents and brother. He talks with them by telephone every\n\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family members could not\n16\nbe mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family members were not in a position to be exploited.\nThe Appeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise\nwas that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice between the\ninterest of the family member and the interest of the United States. (See ISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd,\nApr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb.\n15, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)). Thus, an administrative judge was not\npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.\n12  \ntwo or three months and visited them twice since leaving Cuba 28 years ago. He does\nprovide each of his parents with less than $500 a year in financial support. He traveled\nto Columbia in 2000 to met his wife\u2019s family. He does not personally speak with her\nfamily, but his wife does have regular contact with her sons in Columbia and her father.\nShe also visited her Columbian family 15 months ago. No financial support is provided\nto his wife\u2019s Columbian family. His family relationships, his wife\u2019s family contacts and his\nminimal financial support to his family are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance, but his and his wife\u2019s contacts with family members must be\nconsidered in deciding whether to grant Applicant a clearance. The government must\nestablish that these family relationships create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion or would create a potential conflict of\ninterest between his obligations to protect sensitive information and his desire to help\nhis family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant and his wife\u2019s\nrelationship and contacts with family members as well as the activities of the\ngovernments of Cuba and Columbia and terrorists organizations within these countries.\nSee ISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). The risk that an Applicant\ncould be targeted for manipulation or induced into compromising classified information\nis real, not theoretical. Applicant\u2019s relationship and contacts with his parents and brother\nin Cuba raises a heightened risk of security concerns because Cuba does engage in\nespionage activities in the U.S. There are no indications that Cuban government targets\nU.S. citizens to obtain protected information. Cuba and its intelligence agents did\nreceive protected information from persons in the U.S., but in these cases, the\ninformation was either obtained by Cuban agents or offered to the agents by the U.S.\ncitizens rather than Cuba targeting the U.S. citizens by exploiting, manipulating,\npressuring, or coercing U.S. citizens for protected information. \nUnder the new guidelines, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterests.  In determining if Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s contacts in Columbia cause security\n16\nconcerns, I considered that Columbia and the U.S. have a close relationship, are allies\nin the fight against terrorism, and the citizens of Columbia enjoy basic freedoms similar\nto U.S. citizens. There is no evidence that the Columbian government targets U.S.\ncitizens for protected information. The human rights issues in Columbia arise from the\nterrorist organizations and paramilitary groups, not the Columbian government.\nBecause of the activities of terrorist organizations and paramilitary groups in Columbia,\n\n13  \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s contacts with her family in Columbia raise a heightened risk concern\nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).\nConcerning Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members in Cuba, I have\nconsidered that Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism, provides refuge for members of\nterrorist organizations, maintains stringent control over the lives of its citizens through\nintense physical and electronic surveillance, denies its citizens basic freedoms enjoyed\nby U.S. citizens, and violates basic human rights. While there are no indications in these\ninstances that Cuba is directly targeting U.S. citizens to provide sensitive information,\nCuba does engage in intense espionage in the U.S. Cuba is a hostile country, whose\ninterests are inimical to the U.S. The U.S. is a large democracy and Cuba is a\ntotalitarian government. Because Cuba and the U.S. are adversaries, Cuba would act\nagainst U.S. interests if given an opportunity. While none of these considerations by\nthemselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be considered in determining\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion because of his family members in Cuba.\nHis two trips to Cuba and his contacts with his family members establish that there is a\nheightened risk that Applicant will be targeted under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).\nIn deciding if Applicant has established mitigation, under AG \u00b6 8 (a), I must\nconsider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider whether Applicant has established:\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with his family members is not a basis to deny\nhim a security clearance; however, his burden of proof on mitigation requires more than\nstatements about the limited scope of his conversations with his three brothers and no\nconversations with his wife\u2019s sons and family. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd.\nMay 9, 2008). Because all Cuban industry is state owned, Applicant\u2019s parents and\nbrother have worked, at least indirectly, for the Cuban government. However, his\nparents and brother have never held a political position. It is unclear whether their\nretirement income comes from the Cuban government, but given the Cuban\ngovernment control over industry and other matters of Cuban life, I infer that the\ngovernment is the source of his family\u2019s retirement income. Even though Cuba is a\ntotalitarian state and seeks to harm the U.S., Applicant\u2019s family has not been targeted\n\n14  \nby the Cuban government. His family members have never been imprisoned. In fact, his\nparents were not punished by the Cuban government when they allowed Applicant to\ntake refuge in their home after his escape from authorities in the late 1960s. In addition,\nCuba allowed his mother to travel to the U.S. in 1982 and made no overt contacts with\nhim when he visited his family in 2000 and 2002. His closest family members are\nresidents of the U.S. Since he became a U.S. citizen in 1996, he has exercised the\nrights and privileges of citizenship. Balancing these factors against Cuba\u2019s espionage\nactivities, support of terrorism, and the lack of evidence that Cuba targets U.S. citizens\nfor protected information, I find that Applicant would resolve any conflict in favor of the\nU.S. interests. Likewise, any threats against Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family in Columbia by\nterrorists organizations and paramilitary groups  would be resolved in favor of U.S.\ninterests. His loyalties are to the U.S., not Cuba or Columbia. Applicant has mitigated\nthe government\u2019s security concerns as to his family contacts specified in SOR \u00b6 2.\nunder AG \u00b6 8b.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86 when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 17 d about his Cuban passport. This information is material\nto the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his\nhonesty. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to this question.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n17\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating condition\n18\nAG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the\nallegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n15  \nomission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that\n17\nApplicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nWhen he completed his hand written SF-86 and e-QIP, Applicant indicated that\nhe was a dual citizen of Cuba. He explained that although he has not considered\nhimself a citizen of Cuba after becoming a U.S. citizen, he knew that Cuba still\nconsidered him a citizen because he had to obtain a Cuban passport before he could\nvisit his family in Cuba. He not only listed his dual citizenship status, but he also listed\nhis trips to Cuba in 2000 on both applications and his 2002 trip on the e-QIP. His failure\nto list his Cuban passport on the e-QIP is not dispositive in light of the other information\ncontained in his SF-86 and e-QIP. He clearly presented other information which, by\nitself, shows his connection to Cuba and raised a the security concern under Guideline\nB. The presentation of this information indicates that Applicant did not intentionally\nfalsify his security clearance application. It shows he had no intention of concealing his\nconnection to Cuba. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.18\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\nrequires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single item in\nisolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security\n\n16  \nworthiness. I have considered all the facts and evidence in the record, even if not\nspecifically enumerated. \nAs a young man, Applicant opposed the totalitarian government established by\nFidel Castro. With friends, he took actions against the interest of the Cuban\ngovernment, which resulted in his conviction by a military court for rebellion, desertion\nand ideological diversion. He served four years in jail for his political beliefs. When Fidel\nCastro granted former political prisoners the opportunity to emigrate to the U.S.,\nApplicant and his immediate family left their homeland for the U.S. in 1980. For nearly\n20 years, Applicant complied with U.S. policy prohibiting visits to Cuba. When  the U.S.\nrevised its policy, Applicant decided to visit his elderly parents twice. During each trip,\nhe worried about being arrested and returned to jail to serve the remainder of his\nsentence. He also felt that he was being watched by the Cuban government. Because\nof his fear of jail and feelings about being watched, he has decided not to return to\nCuba. By this decision, Applicant has eliminated the possibility of exploitation, coercion,\npressure, or duress based on his fear of what could happen if he returns to Cuba. His\nclosest contacts are his daughter, a U.S. citizen and resident, and wife,  a permanent\nresident of the U.S. His sons are U.S. residents. Although he does not actively\nparticipate in any organizations seeking to overthrow the current Cuban government, he\nstrongly supports U.S. policy advocating democratic reforms and changes in Cuba. He\nis not likely to be coerced, pressured or exploited because of his family contacts in\nCuba and his wife\u2019s family contacts in Columbia as his loyalty rests with the U.S.\nApplicant made a conscious decision to obtain and use a Cuban passport after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen. He made this decision solely to visit his elderly parents, whom\nhe had not seen in 20 years. He does not consider himself a citizen of Cuba and does\nnot exercise any rights of Cuban citizenship as part of his daily life. He is proud to be an\nAmerican and treasures the rights he has in the U.S. His loyalty to the U.S. outweighs\nhis decision to obtain and use a Cuban passport to enter Cuba for a family visit.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to list the existence of his Cuban passport relates more to a\nlanguage issue than to intentional conduct on his part. Applicant did not learn English\nuntil after he arrived in the U.S. when he was 32 years old. Despite the fact that he\nspeaks and understand English, it is his second language. As such, he has and will\nalways continue to experience problems with interpretation of words and phrases\nbecause of linguistic differences between English and Spanish. He readily\nacknowledged his trips to Cuba, which required a Cuban passport. On his security\nclearance application, he also acknowledged his birth in Cuba and his dual citizenship\nstatus with Cuba based on Cuba\u2019s requirement that he have a passport. His employer\ncompleted the application for him. He did not read it before he signed it. The omission of\nthe information about his Cuban passport was not deliberate, but careless.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guidelines C, B and E.\n\n17  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Yakeen Qawasmeh, Personal Representative \nSeptember 29, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on November 13, 2006.  On April 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines C and B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 25, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on May 27, 2008.  It was transferred to the undersigned\non June 17, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 8, 2008, scheduling the\nhearing for July 31, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented four exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4.  The Applicant called one witness,\npresented twelve exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open\nuntil close of business on August 21, 2008, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to\n\n2\nsubmit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted five Post-Hearing Exhibits\nreferred to as Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 5.  The official transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on August 8, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Jordan.  The Applicant and\nhis personal representative had no objection.  (Tr. p. 14).  The request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 52 years of age.  He is employed as a\nProduction Supervisor for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Jordan in 1956 to Jordanian parents.  He grew up in\nJordan, and at the age of fourteen moved with his family to Kuwait.  In 1985 [Should this\nbe 1975?], the Applicant came to the United States with a student visa to go to school\nand pursue the American dream.  That same year [Can\u2019t become citizen same year you\nmove here.], he became a naturalized United States citizen.  Although he still thought of\nhimself as a dual citizen of the United States and Jordan, until recently.  Since\nbecoming aware of DoD\u2019s policies concerning dual citizenship, the Applicant has\nformally renounced his dual citizenship with Jordan.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits 1 through 5).   \nThe Applicant is married to an American citizen and they have three children who\nare all American citizens attending college.  None of them speak arabic.  The\nApplicant\u2019s in-laws also reside in the United States.  The Applicant also has one brother\nwho resides and is a naturalized citizen of the United States who has lived here for thirty\nyears.\nThe only immediate family that the Applicant has in Jordan is one brother and\none sister, who are citizens and residents of Jordan.  He contacts them by telephone\noccasionally, about three or four times a year.  His brother is retired from a trucking\ncompany, and his sister is a homemaker.  In the past, he sent monetary gifts to his\nsiblings to help out with funeral expenses but is not obligated to continue to do this.\nThey are not affiliated with the Jordanian Government in any respect.  The Applicant\nhas many extended family members who have the same last name as the Applicant but\n\n3\nwhom he does not know or have any affiliation with.  The only financial interest he had\nin Jordan was an interest in a parcel  of land he shared with his siblings and cousins,\nonce owned by his father.  The land is located in Jordan on the West Bank and the\napproximate value of the land is $20,000.00.  The Applicant has since transferred that\ninterest and no longer owns it.  All of his financial interests and assets are in the United\nStates that include a house, a retirement fund from his employer.\nSince moving to the United States, the Applicant has traveled to Jordan on four\noccasions, 1977, 1980, 1994, and 2007.  He attended a family reunion on one occasion\nand on the other two occasions went to handle emergencies.  One time he thought that\nhis mother was dying, and the other time his sister was in a coma and did pass away.   \nIn 2008, the Applicant assisted the FBI when he reported that he noticed\nactivities that he thought would be harmful to the United States.  (Tr. p. 73).  The\nindividual involved is now serving jail time.\nThe Applicant began working for his current employer in 1997 and applied for a\nSecret level security clearance at that time.  He was initially denied a clearance but\nappealed and voluntarily underwent a Anti-Terrorism and Anti-Espionage polygraph\nexam.  He was subsequent granted his clearance and has held it without incident.   \n  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a\nway as to show a preference for another country over the United States.\nThe Applicant used his American passport on two occasions to enter and exit\nJordan, but during his most recent trip he used his Jordanian passport.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 2).  The Applicant was not aware that by renewing his Jordanian\npassport his security clearance could be in jeopardy.  When learning of DoD\u2019s policy\nconcerning possession of a foreign passport, the Applicant surrendered his passport to\nthe Security Officer at his company.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  Since then, the\nApplicant has gone even a step further and has completely destroyed his Jordanian\npassport once and for all.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 5).  \nThe Applicant has fully assimilated into the American culture and is involved in\nhis community.  He has coached basketball and helped with the Special Olympics.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J).  He has volunteered to feed the homeless and after 9-11\nstarted working at churches to hold memorials for the victims.  He is active in state\npolitics and votes in every election.     \nThe United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation award\nwas issued to the Applicant for his outstanding assistance in connection with their\ninvestigation dated June 2008.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L). \nVarious letters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s community leaders,\nincluding the mayor, a religious leader, his neighbors and friends attest to the\nApplicant\u2019s kindness, respectful attitude, community service, good judgment, and\nhonest and forthright nature.  They consider him to be a very honorable and respected\n\n4\nman who loves the United States for the freedoms and opportunities it has afforded him\nand his family.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C, D , E, F, G and H).  \nADD INFORMATION ON JORDAN\n      \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\ntheses persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\n\n5\nForeign Preference\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n11.  (a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry;\n11.  (b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n11.  (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference),\nand Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown\nbetween Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign\nconnections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises\nlegitimate questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the\ninterests of the United States paramount to that of another nation. The Government\nmust be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  Mitigating\nConditions 8. (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich theses persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\n\n7\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S. and 8. (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation applies.\nIt is acknowledged that the Applicant has a brother and a sister who reside in\nJordan and that he contacts on an occasional basis.  In the past, he has sent money to\nthem to help with funeral costs.  Although he has extended family members in Jordan,\nhe has no association with them whatsoever, or any allegiance to them, or with the\nJordanian Government.  It is noted that the current political situation in Jordan elevates\nthe cause for concern in this case.  However, in this case, the Applicant has lived in the\nUnited States for the past thirty years.  He has been a resident and citizen of the United\nStates for 23 years.  He has a wife and three children who are American citizens.  All of\nhis financial assets are in the United States.  He has fully in cultured himself well into\nAmerican values and the American culture.  He participates in his local community, and\nhas even been commended by the FBI for assisting them in the past.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, the possibility of foreign influence does not exist nor could it\ncreate the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  I\nfind that the Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Condition 10(a) exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member applies.  However, Mitigation Conditions 11(a)\ndual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country, 11(b)\nthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship, and 11(e) the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated also apply.\nThe Applicant was a dual citizen of Jordan and the United States.  Since then\n[when?] he has formally renounced his Jordanian citizenship and destroyed his\nJordanian passport.  Except for his two siblings in Jordan, he has essentially cut all ties\nto that country.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find for the Applicant under\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference). \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines\nB and C.  \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n2.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n2.b.: For the Applicant\n \nSubpara.\n2.c.: For the Applicant\n \n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

McCormack, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n110 U.S.C. \u00a7 892.\n210 U.S.C. \u00a7 909.\n310 U.S.C. \u00a7 934.\n410 U.S.C. \u00a7 933.\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 21, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination was erroneous; whether the Judge erred in his application of the Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Conditions (PCDC); whether the Judge\u2019s favorable decision was supported by the\nweight of the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.\nConsistent with the following, we reverse the decision of the Judge.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant, who has a master\u2019s\ndegree, works for a Defense contractor in the field of technology integration.  He served in the U.S.\nArmy from 1989 until 2003, when he was discharged Under Other Than Honorable Conditions\n(UOTHC) in lieu of trial by court-martial.  \nIn 2003, while on active duty, Applicant served overseas in a hostile fire zone.  A major, he\nwas a counterintelligence officer for a special operations unit.  At the time in question, Applicant\nand two enlisted members had dinner in a local town, where they consumed alcohol.  After dinner\nthey visited a mountain resort area.  They carried firearms.  On the way, they saw an abandoned\nvehicle, and one of the enlisted members started shooting at it.  Applicant, an officer and the senior\nmilitary member, did not stop the shooting.  The vehicle in which they were traveling became stuck\nin the snow, so they called for assistance.  \nAfter an investigation, Applicant was charged with violating two general orders (violation\nof curfew and drinking alcohol while in possession of a weapon);1 damage to property;2 conduct\nprejudicial to good order and discipline;3 and conduct unbecoming an officer.4  The Army accepted\nApplicant\u2019s offer to resign his commission in lieu of trial by court-martial, and, as stated above,\nthereafter discharged him UOTHC.  As a consequence, the Army suspended his access to classified\ninformation, although there is no evidence that he was aware of that fact until he was provided the\ninformation in conjunction with his preparation for the hearing in the case before us.  \nWhile married and an officer, Applicant engaged in sexual relations with an enlisted woman\n(W).  Applicant\u2019s marriage broke up, partly in response to this affair.  After they left the Army,\n\n3\nApplicant and W went to work for a Defense contractor and continued their relationship.  They\nbroke up in 2004.  The next year, Applicant\u2019s employer informed him that W had filed sexual\nharassment allegations against him.  He told his employer that the allegations were unfounded.  He\nreceived no disciplinary action, and there is no independent evidence of the substance of W\u2019s\ncomplaint.  \nApplicant\u2019s employer laid him off in February 2006.  Although the particular contract on\nwhich he was working terminated in March 2006, he was taken off the contract a month early\nbecause of complaints from the government/client representative.  Applicant denied that he was\nterminated for cause, believing that there was simply a personality clash underlying the complaints.\nThe employer could not find Applicant other work, so it laid him off, giving him a severance\npackage.  A co-worker was released from the contract due to complaints by the same\ngovernment/client representative.  She corroborated Applicant\u2019s version of the events.  She and\nApplicant were in a relationship at the time.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had made false statements to investigators and on his\nsecurity clearance application (SCA) concerning, inter alia, (1) whether he had experienced\nperformance problems while working for the Defense contractor and (2) the reason for his\ntermination.  In January, and later in September, of 2007, Applicant was interviewed pursuant to his\napplication of a security clearance.  The interviews were summarized and did not include the\nquestions or verbatim answers.  \u201cThe Government did not offer any written statements by the\nApplicant concerning this interview.\u201d  The Judge stated that Applicant denied making false\nstatements to investigators or in his security clearance application.  The Judge stated that he found\nthis testimony to be credible.  Decision at 4-5.\nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for his professionalism, loyalty, trustworthiness,\nand dependability.  His civilian and military performance appraisals reflect outstanding performance.\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\n\n5Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities[.]\u201d  \n6Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 16(b): \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative[.]\u201d  \n4\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nAs stated above, one of the SOR allegations addressed a false statement by Applicant to\ninvestigators during his security clearance interview.  Specifically, Applicant was alleged to have\nstated to the investigator that the reason for his layoff from the Defense contractor was the expiration\nof a contract.  The SOR goes on to state: \u201cIn truth, you were removed by [contractor] from working\non a project due to performance issues raised by [contractor\u2019s] Government client and you were laid\noff because [contractor] had no other work for you.\u201d  In the Analysis portion of the Decision, the\nJudge stated that the Government\u2019s evidence of this statement was \u201cbased upon a report that\nsummarized an interview by an agent who did not testify and was not subject to cross-examination.\u201d\nAs he had in his Findings, the Judge stated that neither the questions nor verbatim answers were\nincluded in the Government\u2019s evidence.  Accordingly, he \u201cgave this evidence less weight than\nApplicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d  \nConcluding that the Government had failed to present substantial evidence of the false\nstatement at issue, the Judge stated that PCDCs 16(a)5 and 16(b)6 did not apply to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge erred in this conclusion,\ntaking issue with the credibility determination the Judge performed regarding the interview summary\n(Government Exhibit [GE] 3) and Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony.  While we give deference to a\n\n7Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n5\nJudge\u2019s credibility determination,7 in this case we conclude that his determination was based upon\nan erroneous evaluation of GE 3 and is not sustainable.\nIt is true that GE 3 does not contain the actual questions posed or Applicant\u2019s verbatim\nanswers; however, it was signed by Applicant, who swore to its truthfulness, with certain factual\ncorrections on unrelated matters.  As such, GE 3 became the equivalent of an admission by\nApplicant, and the Judge erred in not evaluating it as such.  In this exhibit, Applicant discussed the\nallegation of sexual harassment lodged against him by W while they were working for the Defense\ncontractor.  The document goes on to state that Applicant \u201cdenied having any further problems\nduring his employment with [contractor]. [Applicant] was laid off from [contractor] in Feb 06\nbecause the contract ended.\u201d  Moreover, at the hearing, Applicant acknowledged making this\nstatement to the interviewer.  Tr. at 154.  The Judge erred in concluding that the Government had\nnot presented substantial evidence that Applicant made the statement.  \n To constitute a security concern under PCDC 16(b), a statement must be false and the falsity\nmust be deliberate.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010).  Department\nCounsel points to record evidence that contractor had concerns about Applicant\u2019s performance prior\nto laying him off.  GE 7 is a series of e-mails pertaining to Applicant\u2019s job performance with\ncontractor.  One of these is by a government/client representative, advising contractor officials of\nperceived deficiencies in Applicant\u2019s discharge of duty.  This e-mail describes incidents of\ninsubordination, misrepresentation, failure to focus on essential tasks, etc.  This e-mail constitutes\nsubstantial evidence that Applicant experienced performance problems while working for contractor.\nWe note the Judge\u2019s finding, described above, that Applicant was taken off the particular contract\nbecause of complaints from a client.  The record supports a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s denial of\nperformance problems was objectively false.\nOn the question of Applicant\u2019s intent, there is no evidence that Applicant saw the e-mail\noutlining his professional deficiencies.  However, GE 7 contains additional e-mails between\nApplicant and a contractor human relations (HR) representative.  In one e-mail, Applicant\nacknowledged that he was being removed and wished \u201cto confirm that there are no performance\nissues pertaining to this removal.\u201d  The HR representative replied: \nThe basic answer is that we had to transfer you off the . . . program because of the\nrelationship with the client.  I believe that is the key to the current actions.  As you\nand I talked, this was based on the perceptions of your actions by the client.  So I can\nnot confirm that there are no performance issues in the client\u2019s decision to direct\n[contractor] to remove you from the program.  \nIn a later e-mail, the HR representative mentioned efforts to place Applicant in a specified\njob location. \n\n8Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 16(c): \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information[.]\u201d  \n9Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 16(d): \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available\ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information[.]\u201d   \n6\n[I]t was [contractor\u2019s] plan to transition you to that location when the client was\nready.  Your name was submitted for that effort and we felt that this transfer would\nbe a win-win situation\u2013for you and for [contractor].  However, [contractor] has now\nbeen placed in a situation where there have been some performance issues raised by\nthe current client to the potential client which will place your performance under\nclose scrutiny . . . [R]ecent events have caused the client to question your\nperformance . . . Therefore, the company has made the decision that you are probably\nnot the appropriate employee to be assigned to the . . . location.  This is purely a\nbusiness decision, while unfortunate for you, was contributed to by your actions.\nThe HR representative stated that the contractor was looking for other jobs for Applicant to\nperform.  However, as the Judge found, the contractor subsequently terminated Applicant\u2019s\nemployment.  These e-mails were sufficient to have placed a reasonable person on notice that\nmanagement had problems with Applicant\u2019s job performance in the days preceding his layoff.  The\nGovernment has presented substantial evidence that, at the time Applicant denied to the security\nclearance interviewer that he had experienced job problems with contractor, he could not reasonably\nhave believed that his denial was truthful.  Accordingly, this evidence raises the security concern\ndescribed in PCDC 16(b), and the Judge erred by concluding otherwise.\nThe Judge did conclude that Applicant\u2019s poor leadership while in the Army raised Guideline\nE security concerns, but he further concluded that Applicant had demonstrated mitigation.  However,\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in not specifically analyzing the case under PCDCs\n16(c)8 and (d)9 in order to address the full scope of Applicant\u2019s conduct.  Department Counsel cites\nto the Judge\u2019s Findings and to record evidence of the following: (1) the  misconduct underlying\nApplicant\u2019s court-martial and his subsequent UOTHC discharge; (2) Applicant\u2019s additional\nfraternization with W while they were both on active duty; (3) the harassment allegation filed by W\nagainst Applicant while they were working for the contractor; (4) the circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s loss of employment; and (5) the false statement to the investigator.  \nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that these matters, considered together, support a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and lack of\ncandor.  Even if, when viewed in isolation, some of these incidents might be of limited concern,\ntaken together they paint a picture of Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability that is at odds with the\n\n7\nrequirements of national security as set forth in the Directive.  Evidence of these incidents is\nsufficient to raise the two disqualifying conditions mentioned above.  Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that, by not raising these PCDCs, the Judge foreclosed a mitigation analysis that\ntook into account the full scope of Applicant\u2019s security significant conduct.  Rather, he limited his\nanalysis to conduct occurring during Applicant\u2019s military service, which, viewed by itself and\nwithout reference to subsequent events, could plausibly be mitigated due to the passage of time.  \nThe Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors did not\nconsider the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct and was erroneous.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23384\nat 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007) (The Directive requires a Judge to evaluate the totality of an\nindividual\u2019s conduct and circumstances in determining the individual\u2019s security eligibility).\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to consider important aspects of the case\nand ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record\nevidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s security concerns under the\nEgan standard.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

McCormack, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \n \nThe evidence fails to establish some disqualifying conduct and Applicant \nmitigated the remaining security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. DOHA subsequently issued Applicant an amended \nSOR on October 13, 2010.1 DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n                                                          \n1 Department Counsel amended the SOR pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E.3.1.13. \n \nApril 21, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the original SOR on December 31, 2008, and he answered \nthe amended SOR on November 5, 2010. He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on December 14, 2010, with a hearing date of January 11, \n2011. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) \n1 through 8, which were admitted into evidence without any objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s exhibit index was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, \npresented one witness, and offered exhibits (AE) A through F that were admitted into \nevidence without any objections. Applicant\u2019s cover page and table of contents was \nmarked as HE II. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 21, 2011.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nDuring the hearing, the Government presented evidence that another defense \nagency granted Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information \n(SCI) on October 31, 2009.2 This fact raised an issue of whether Applicant should be \ngiven reciprocity under section 2-204 of the National Industrial Security Program \nOperating Manual (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006. Section 2-204 of the NISPOM \nstates, in part: \n \n \nAny previously granted PCL (Personnel Clearance) based upon a current \ninvestigation of a scope that meets or exceeds that necessary for the \nclearance required shall provide the basis for a new clearance without \nfurther investigation or adjudication unless significant derogatory \ninformation that was not previously adjudicated becomes known to the \ngranting agency. \n \n \nApplicant contends that because another defense agency granted a personal \nclearance/access eligibility to the Applicant based upon a current investigation of a \nscope that met or exceeded that necessary for the clearance required, Applicant should \nbe issued a security clearance without the requirement of further investigation or \nadjudication. Department Counsel contends that reciprocity does not apply because the \namended SOR addresses matters that were not previously adjudicated, specifically, \nalleged false statements to an investigator (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g). \n \n \nI find that reciprocity does not apply in Applicant\u2019s case because it is unclear from \nthe Government evidence what specific conduct was adjudicated by the other defense \nagency before it granted Applicant access to SCI on October 31, 2009. Although the \nPersonal Conduct, Alcohol Consumption, and Criminal Conduct guidelines were cited in \nthe evidence, no specific facts were delineated. Because of the ambiguity of the \nevidence, I cannot determine if any of the current SOR allegations were adjudicated in \nthe prior investigation and therefore will not apply reciprocity.3   \n                                                          \n2 GE 8. \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 08-10088 (App. Bd. July 19, 2010). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (partially) through 1.c of the \noriginal SOR, and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g of the amended SOR. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He is divorced and has two sons. He currently works \nfor a defense contractor in the area of technology integration. He holds both a \nbachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. He served in the Army from May 1989 until \nhe was administratively separated in lieu of court-martial in October 2003 at the rank of \nmajor. He has held a security clearance since 1998.4   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raised in the SOR includes: (1) committing several offenses \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in 2003 for which he accepted an \nadministrative discharge, under other than honorable conditions, in lieu of trial by court-\nmartial (SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) engaging in sexual relations with an enlisted women while he \nwas an officer in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); (3) being named as the subject of sexual \nharassment allegations while working for a defense contractor in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); (4) \nhaving his authorization to SCI suspended by the Army on September 2, 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d); (5) making false statements on a security clearance application and to \ninvestigators concerning his knowledge of his suspended SCI access in 2003, whether \nhe had any employment problems when he worked for a defense contractor, and the \nreason for his termination from employment with a defense contractor (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.g). \n \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant was assigned to a hostile-fire overseas area. He was a major \nworking as a counterintelligence officer for a special operations unit. In January 2003, \nApplicant and two enlisted servicemembers had dinner out in a local town. They had \ndrinks with dinner. After dinner, they decided to take a drive up to a mountain resort \narea. Because of possible hostilities, all three were armed. They were all wearing \ncivilian clothing. On their way up to the mountain resort they saw an abandoned vehicle. \nAccording to Applicant, one of the enlisted members began shooting at the vehicle. \nApplicant was the senior military member and failed to stop the shooting. Later, their \nvehicle got stuck in the snow and they had to call for assistance. The local police were \ncalled to investigate the shooting incident and ultimately Applicant\u2019s role was revealed. \nAfter an investigation, in May 2003, general court-martial charges were preferred \nagainst Applicant. The specifications included: violation of two general orders (violation \nof curfew and drinking alcohol while in possession of a weapon); damage to property, \nconduct prejudicial to good order and discipline; and conduct unbecoming an officer. \nRather than face the possibility of conviction on the charges, Applicant offered to resign \nhis commission. His offer was accepted and he was administratively separated with an \nother than honorable discharge in August 2003.5  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 80-81, 168; GE 1, 8. \n \n5 Tr. at 86-92; GE 5-6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn June 2003, in conjunction with Applicant\u2019s decision to resign his commission, \nhis access to classified information was suspended by the Army. Applicant denies that \nhe was informed of the suspension. There is no information in the record indicating that \nApplicant was made aware of the suspension until recently when he was provided \ninformation in preparation for this hearing.6 \n \n \nApplicant engaged in a sexual relationship with an enlisted female (H.R.) while \nhe was a commissioned officer and while he was married. The relationship began in late \n2002 or early 2003. Upon his discharge from the Army and return to the United States, \nApplicant\u2019s marriage broke up, in part, due to his infidelity. In September 2003, while \nseparated from his wife, Applicant resumed the relationship with H.R. Eventually, both \nwere hired by the same defense contractor. The two continued their personal \nrelationship until October 2004. According to Applicant, between October 2004 and \nOctober 2005, they had minimal professional contacts. In September 2005, Applicant \nwas informed by his employer that H.R. raised sexual harassment allegations against \nhim. He was asked to respond to them. He told his employer there was nothing to them. \nAccording to Applicant, no disciplinary action resulted from the complaint. The record \ncontains no independent evidence of the substance of the sexual harassment \nallegations, any investigation of the allegations, or resulting actions by management.7 \n \n \nApplicant was laid off from his job with a defense contractor in February 2006. He \nwas working on a particular contract that ended in March 2006. He was abruptly taken \noff the contract in February 2006 because of complaints from the government/client \nrepresentative. Applicant denied that he was terminated for cause and believed the \ngovernment/client representative had a personality clash with him. The complaints were \nnot made directly to Applicant, but to his employer. His employer tried to find him \nanother position, but because the contract was ending in March 2006, there was \nnothing else available. When Applicant left the company in February 2006, he received \na severance package.8   \n \n \nA former coworker testified about Applicant\u2019s release from the contract that led to \nhis layoff. She was also released from the contract because of a similar complaint by \nthe government/client representative. She corroborated Applicant\u2019s version of events \nsurrounding their release from the contract. She and Applicant were in a relationship at \nthat time.9   \n \n \nOn January 5, 2007, and September 11, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an \ninvestigator concerning his security clearance eligibility. Those interviews were \nsummarized and included as part of GE 3. The summarized interviews do not contain \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 97-98; GE 5. \n \n7 Tr. at 94-97; GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 104-114. \n \n9 Tr. at 52-77. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nspecific questions asked by the investigator, nor do they contain verbatim answers by \nthe Applicant.10  \n \n \nThe Government did not offer any written statements by the Applicant concerning \nthis interview. Additionally, the Government agent conducting the interview did not \ntestify at hearing. Alternatively, Applicant testified at the hearing about his departure \nfrom the government contractor in question and was subject to cross-examination by \nDepartment Counsel. He denied making any false statements to investigators or \nproviding false information on his security clearance application. I found his testimony \ncredible.11   \n \n \n \nApplicant presented the statements of several former coworkers from other \ncontractor positions and military members who served with him. All the statements \nindicate that Applicant is a professional who is dedicated to his mission. He is \ncharacterized as loyal, trustworthy, and dependable. Applicant also provided his civilian \nperformance appraisals and Army officer evaluation reports.  Both sets of documents \nreflect Applicant\u2019s outstanding performance during the years covered.12  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n                                                          \n10 GE 3. \n \n11 Tr. at 98,  \n101-114, 163. \n \n12 AE B-F. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct resulting in his discharge from the Army and his sexual \nrelationship with an enlisted person reflect personal conduct that creates a vulnerability \nto his personal standing. AG \u00b6 16(e) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Although Applicant \nadmits some type of sexual harassment allegation was made against him, insufficient \nevidence was offered by the Government regarding the substance of the allegation. No \nvulnerability was established for SOR \u00b6 1.c. The allegation listed at SOR \u00b6 1.d has the \nsame factual basis as the allegation listed at SOR \u00b6 1.a and will not be separately \nconsidered. \nI found Applicant\u2019s denial of submitting a false security clearance application and \nmaking false statements to investigator\u2019s credible. The Government produced no \nevidence showing Applicant was aware his SCI access was suspended when he \ncompleted his security clearance application. Likewise, the Government\u2019s proof to \nestablish Applicant\u2019s false statements to investigators is also lacking. The Government\u2019s \nevidence to prove the falsifications was based upon a report that summarized an \ninterview by an agent who did not testify and was not subject to cross-examination. The \nreport does not state the specific questions the interviewer asked and it does not \ncontain the verbatim answers of the Applicant. I gave this evidence less weight than \nApplicant\u2019s testimony. Therefore, the evidence does not support the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e \u2013 1.g, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) do not apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s poor judgment and lack of leadership that led to his unfavorable \ndischarge from the Army happened eight years ago. He has acknowledged his \nresponsibility regarding those incidents and has learned from them. He paid a \nsignificant price for his lapse in judgment. He presented outstanding performance \nappraisals from recent employers and is held in high regard by coworkers. Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are not in doubt. I am convinced that \nthese types of action will not recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s service to \nhis country before the events that led to his discharge. I also considered the \nseriousness of his actions resulting in the discharge. I am satisfied Applicant realizes \nthe lack of judgment he exhibited eight years ago and has learned from that experience. \nI also considered the passage of time since then. Additionally, I considered his current \nwork environment and the strong recommendation he received from coworkers \nconcerning his reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant met his burden and provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.2\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 9, 2009\n\nExhibit (App. Ex.) I\n Applicant was telephonically contacted by Department Counsel prior to issuance of the Notice of\n3\nHearing and agreed to the hearing date of October 22, 2008.\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on September 18, 2008. A notice of hearing was\nissued on October 6, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 22, 2008.  The hearing was\n3\nconducted as scheduled. The Government submitted two documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 and admitted into the record without\nobjection. Applicant testified but did not submit any documentary exhibits. The record was\nheld open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit documentation in support of his\ncase. One document was timely received, marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1 and admitted\ninto the record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum was\nmarked as App. Ex. II and is included in the file.  The transcript was received on November\n6, 2008.     \nProcedural Matters\nPrior to taking evidence, I clarified the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph\n3.a for Applicant\u2019s benefit to make certain he understood to what he had admitted in his\nresponse to the SOR. I thereafter granted him permission to withdraw his previous\nadmission to that allegation and to substitute a denial thereto without objection by\nDepartment Counsel. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding an\nadditional allegation under Guideline J, to wit: \u201c3.b That information set forth under\nparagraph 1 above.\u201d Applicant did not object to the requested amendment. Accordingly,\nI granted the motion and made the requested amendment on the face of the SOR.\nApplicant thereafter admitted the allegation and indicated he did not require additional time\nto respond to it. \n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 22-year-old single man who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since July 2007. He works as a janitor assigned to the floor crew that is\nresponsible for keeping the office floors clean. He graduated from high school in 2004.\nFollowing high school, except for a few months immediately after he graduated spent\nworking as a laborer, Applicant was unemployed and lived with his mother until he obtained\nemployment in a pizza restaurant in May 2006. Thereafter, with the exception of a one-\nmonth period of unemployment in June 2007, he worked at the pizza restaurant until he\nbegan his current employment.\n \nApplicant first used marijuana in May 2004 when a marijuana cigarette was passed\nto him at a party. From then until March 2007, he used and purchased marijuana on a fairly\n\n3\nregular basis.  He estimates he smoked marijuana as much as three to four times a week.\n(GE 2) Applicant admitted his use of marijuana was illegal.\nApplicant stopped using marijuana in March 2007 because he wanted to get the job\nhe currently has with a government contractor and knew that drug use was prohibited. He\nhas not used any controlled substance since that time and he does not intend to use any\ncontrolled substance in the future. Applicant submitted a notarized statement to that effect\nin which he acknowledged that the use or possession of illegal drugs or controlled\nsubstances in the future \u201cwill result in the immediate termination of my clearance\nprivileges.\u201d (AE 1) This document was faxed to Department Counsel from Applicant\u2019s\nemployer\u2019s workplace.\nApplicant has been dating a woman he has known since childhood who he hopes\nto marry. She knows he previously smoked marijuana but she neither uses nor approves\nof the use of any controlled substances. Applicant testified his goals in life are to \u201c(L)ive life\nto the fullest that I can, make as much money as I can, provide for a family.\u201d (Tr. p. 46) \nApplicant failed to disclose his use of marijuana, as required, in the security\nclearance application he submitted in September 2007. Applicant testified he improperly\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the applicable question because he rushed through the program without\ncarefully reading the questions and did not review the completed Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) before signing it. (Tr. pp. 62-64) Applicant was\ninterviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on\nNovember 14, 2007. In his report of interview, the investigator noted:\nThe subject was asked about drug use and he immediately admitted to using\nmarijuana (discrepant). This was different than what was entered on the SF-\n86. He did not try to hide this fact, but could not give any reason for not\nmarking yes to this question. . . . (GE 2) \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines H (drug involvement),\nJ (criminal conduct) and E (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n7\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n4\napplicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden\nof proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of\n7\nthe evidence.\u201d  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n8\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement; and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations. Likewise, criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness; and, by its very nature, calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \nApplicant illegally purchased and used marijuana on a regular basis between May\n2004 and March 2007. Under guideline H, disqualifying conditions (DC) 25(a): any drug\nabuse; and 25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase, sale, or distribution\n\n5\napply. Under guideline J, DC 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted apply.     \nIt has now been almost two years since Applicant last used marijuana. His use and\npurchase of marijuana occurred while he was somewhat younger and without much\ndirection in his life. His testimony makes clear that he made a conscious choice to stop\nusing marijuana when he sought more meaningful employment with a defense contractor\nin 2007, and that he has abided by that decision ever since. He is now looking forward to\ngetting married, raising a family, and earning an income with which he can support that\nfamily. Applicant convincingly testified he does not intend to abuse any controlled\nsubstance in the future and he submitted a notarized statement acknowledging that his\nclearance will be immediately terminated if he violates that condition of his clearance\neligibility. \nApplicant is a young man who is guilty of the not uncommon youthful indiscretion\nof illegally using marijuana. His testimony and totality of the evidence available in this case\nestablish he has matured and he is committed to being a useful and productive employee\nand family man. While maintaining the Government\u2019s position that Applicant should not be\ngranted a security clearance, Department Counsel, acknowledged:\nApplicant has come to us today and I think it\u2019s pretty clear that he seems\ncandid and forthcoming, answers questions directly I\u2019ll be it [sic] quietly and\nthe Government does appreciate that. (Tr. p. 77)\nShe also noted:\nAnd so, you know, although he\u2019s come here today and he\u2019s been very candid\nand open, he does seem in earnest about his present intent to not smoke\nmarijuana in the future. (Tr. p. 79)\nUnder Guideline H, mitigating conditions (MC) 26(a): the behavior happened so long\nago . . . or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 26(b):\na demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: . . . (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation apply. Under Guideline J, MC 32(a): so much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse of restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\n\n6\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations for not listing his marijuana use in the 2007 e-QIP he\nsubmitted are credible. His appearance, manner of testifying and the substance of his\ntestimony abundantly establish he is a relatively unsophisticated individual who very\nbelievably could be overwhelmed by the effort of preparing an electronic security clearance\napplication. Most significant are the notations by the OPM investigator to the effect that\nApplicant immediately and completely disclosed his use of marijuana when asked about\nit during a routine interview. Applicant was not confronted with any independent information\nthat would indicate the interviewer was aware of the use. Instead, Applicant was apparently\nsimply asked a clear question that he could understand. Department Counsel echoed my\nimpressions about Applicant\u2019s credibility in her closing argument when she observed: \u201cI\nthink that the Applicant did testify creditably [sic] regarding the allegation under Guideline\nE . . . .\u201d (Tr. p. 81) Accordingly, I find Applicant did not deliberately falsify the 2007 e-QIP.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including Applicant\u2019s age, the period of time that has elapsed since he last used\nmarijuana, the sincerity he demonstrated in his testimony and through the statement he\nsubmitted to remaining drug free, to being a productive member of society, a successful\nemployee and a committed family man. I have also considered the whole person concept,\nthe factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying\nconditions. Applicant has mitigated the security concern caused by his former use of\nmarijuana and the related criminal conduct. He has overcome the case against him and\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a & b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

On April 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines G, H, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 24, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 7, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative \nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 20, 2008, and I received \nthe case assignment on June 3, 2008. The case was reassigned from another \nadministrative judge due to caseload considerations.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \non June 10, 2008, setting the hearing for July 3, 2008.  Applicant retained counsel who \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nentered her appearance on June 24, 2008, and requested a continuance.  I granted the \ncontinuance, and rescheduled the hearing to July 21, 2008.  An Amended Notice of \nHearing was sent on June 26, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 21, \n2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified, offered the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted \nExhibits A through E, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on July 30, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings  \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting \u00b6 3.a, alleging \nApplicant used marijuana after obtaining a security clearance in 1996. (Tr. 7, 8.)   \nDepartment Counsel also moved to amend the SOR in \u00b6 1.f, by deleting the word \n\u201cdrug,\u201d and inserting in its place the word \u201calcohol.\u201d  Applicant had no objection to these \namendments, and I granted the motion to make these two changes in the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 7, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in all allegations in the SOR, except in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a.1, and 2.a.2, which he denied. \nHe also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old, and married with three children. His stepson died in \nJune 2007.  His wife had a stroke in November 2006, from which she is recovering.  He \nworks for a defense contractor in the engineering field.  He started work for this \nemployer 23 years ago in 1985.  Applicant has had a security clearance since 1985, \nand has not had any security violations in that time. (Tr. 50-56, 72, 92, 93) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the past 10 years testified on his behalf.  The \nsupervisor stated Applicant has a good reputation for truthfulness, and is trustworthy.  \nHe considers Applicant to be a man of integrity, who is a conscientious worker and \nfollows the company rules and procedures.  Applicant did tell him about his alcohol \nrelated arrests in 2006 and 2007.  He also knew about the illegal substance arrests \nbecause Applicant told him at the time they occurred.  He rearranged Applicant\u2019s work \nschedule so Applicant could go to treatment sessions. (Tr. 20-35) \n \n \nA co-worker of Applicant testified next on his behalf.  He has known Applicant \nsince 1986.  He considers Applicant very diligent in his work ethic and practices.  The \nco-worker never saw Applicant intoxicated at work, or arrive at work under the influence \nof alcohol.  He is aware of Applicant\u2019s 2006 and 2007 arrests, his wife\u2019s stroke, and his \nstepson\u2019s death.  The witness also knew Applicant went to treatment for alcohol. (Tr. \n37-48) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted his employee evaluations from 1995 to 2007.  His \nevaluations are all high ranking, often in the \u201cexceeds performance requirements\u201d to \n\u201coutstanding performance.\u201d  His 2007 evaluation ranking shows a decrease from the 3 \nranking (\u201cexceeds performance requirements\u201d) to a 2.8 ranking, which is a high \u201cmeets \nperformance requirements\u201d up to the \u201cexceeds performance requirements\u201d ranking.  \nApplicant also submitted a written character reference from a co-worker on the night \nshift with him for the past 20 years.  The reference cites Applicant\u2019s experience and \nabilities to perform difficult tasks quickly and efficiently.  He also is determined and \ndedicated to achieving the goals and objectives given him by his supervisors.  Applicant \nalso has shown integrity and high ethical standards.  Applicant also submitted copies of \nseveral incentive awards he earned from his company over the past few years. (Tr. 65, \n66; Exhibits A, D, and E)  \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol from 1980, when he was in high school, to May \n2008.  At times during those 28 years, he would consume alcohol to excess and \nintoxication.  He drank beer with friends, usually a six pack, over three hours.  It has \nbeen one year since he drank that quantity. He abstained in 1992 for about six weeks.  \nHe is currently abstaining from alcohol consumption.  Applicant has four alcohol-related \narrests.  First, he was arrested on March 23, 1998, on charges of transportation or \npossession of alcohol by an auto operator.  He pled guilty on April 9, 1998, and paid a \nfine of $75.  Next, Applicant was arrested on August 4, 2003, on charges of transporting \nalcohol by an auto driver.  On October 10, 2003, the charges were dismissed.  His third \narrest was on July 27, 2006, on charges of transportation of alcohol by an auto driver.  \nThe fourth arrest was on January 11, 2007, on charges of driving while under the \ninfluence (DUI), driving under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol content \n(BAC) of .08, operating an uninsured motor vehicle, and improper lane usage.  On July \n9, 2007, he pled guilty to the DUI charge, and was sentenced to one year supervision, \nordered to attend a DUI school, and fined $2,051.00.  Applicant remains on court \nsupervision until July 8, 2009.  (Tr. 56, 62, 73-81, 90, 91; Exhibits 2, 3)   \n \n \nSince November 2007, Applicant has attended alcohol education, counseling and \ntreatment with a service provider.  This program was part of the court order placing him \non supervision.  He underwent 10 hours of risk education, and 40 hours of individual \nand group therapy counseling with the same service provider.  The court ordered only \n20 hours of counseling.  The treatment portion of the program showed Applicant that he \nshould not use alcohol as a reward for his good job performance.  He has replaced \nalcohol with family activities, such as coaching his son\u2019s baseball team and other \nactions.  He joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and has a sponsor.  This program \nincludes substance abuse counseling, including drug abuse.  The documents submitted \ndiagnoses Applicant with alcoholism, and that he is in the process of \u201cfinishing all \nrecommendations\u201d.  (Tr. 54-56, 59, 60, 64, 79, 80, 81, 90; Exhibits 2, B and C) \n \n \nApplicant used alcohol as a reward for his hard work, and to relieve stress.  The \nstress he attributed to his wife\u2019s 2006 stroke, and the death in 2007 of her son.  \nApplicant felt he was under a lot of stress in 2006 and 2007.  His wife was upset with his \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbehavior and threatened to divorce him in 2000.  Applicant did not drink alcohol at \nhome, but would go out of his home to consume it.  (Tr. 56, 57, 71, 95, 98, 107) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on a monthly basis from his senior year in high school, \nin 1980.  This was about the same time he started consuming alcohol.  He used it after \nhe was divorced from his first wife in 1989 until about 1995.  He used marijuana alone, \nand monthly or bi-weekly in that time period.  He last used marijuana on March 25, \n2007, as he stated under cross-examination at the hearing and in the interrogatories \nsubmitted by the Government, which he answered with the March 2007 admission.  \nApplicant stated once during the hearing he last used it in January 2007.  Applicant \nused cocaine once in September 1996.  He used the marijuana and cocaine while \nhaving a security clearance from August 1996 onward to 2007.  He purchased the \nmarijuana for his personal use only from dealers.  In September 1996, Applicant was \narrested on charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana, \nand possession of drug paraphernalia. No disposition of this arrest is known.  Applicant \nwas again arrested on July 27, 2006, on a charge of marijuana possession.  In August \n2007, Applicant pled guilty and sentenced to two years of probation, ordered to perform \nfive days of community service, and fined $750.  He continues on probation for this \noffense until September 2009.  Applicant was again arrested for possession of \nmarijuana on March 6, 2007, when going to court on the 2006 arrest.  He had marijuana \nin his coat pocket as he was going through the court security system.  Applicant \nreceived three months probation in June 2007 upon his conviction for this offense.  His \ntreatment program includes substance abuse counseling to address his marijuana use. \n(Tr. 60-64, 82-89, 92, 95, 99; Exhibits 2, B and C) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on March 28, 2007.  \nResponding to Question 23(c), \u201cAre there currently any charges pending against you for \nany criminal offense?\u201d, Applicant answered by disclosing his January 2007 DUI offense, \nbut not disclosing his July 27, 2006, arrest for marijuana and his March 3, 2007, \nmarijuana arrest.  In answering Question 23(d), \u201cHave you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol and drugs?\u201d, Applicant disclosed only his \nJanuary 2007 DUI offense, not disclosing his September 1996, arrest for marijuana \npossession, his March 2007 marijuana arrest, and his March 1998, August 2003, and \nJuly 2006, alcohol-related arrests.  Next, he answered Question 24(a), \u201cSince the age of \n16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, including marijuana and other controlled substances?\u201d, by stating, \u201cYes\u201d and \nadmitting he used marijuana two times in August 2006, failing to disclose that he used \nmarijuana at least four other times since January 2005.  Finally, Applicant failed to  \ndisclose on his previous July 3, 1996, SCA that he had used marijuana at least monthly \nor bi-weekly between 1989 and 1995 in response to Question 27, \u201cSince the age of 16 \nor in the last 7 years, which ever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, for example, marijuana, etc.\u201d  Applicant admitted he deliberately failed to \ndisclose this information on both SCAs because he was embarrassed and in a \u201cstate of \ndenial.\u201d  He did not disclose this information to a Government investigator before being \nconfronted with it. (Tr. 68, 69, 89, 96; Exhibits 1 and 4) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.  The following two conditions apply in this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and, \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol from high school until May 2008. He drank to excess \nnumerous times during those 28 years.  Police authorities arrested him four times for \nvarious offenses, including possession of alcohol as a driver in 1998, 2003, and 2006, \nand then in 2007 for DUI, driving an uninsured motor vehicle, and improper lane usage.  \nThe severity of his series of actions while driving while consuming alcohol or with \nalcohol in the passenger compartment, a violation of law, seemed to have been \nincreasing over time. He also used alcohol outside his house, to avoid displaying his \nconsumption in front of his family.  That desire to use alcohol outside his home led to his \ndriving arrests related to alcohol use. He remains on supervision for his most recent DUI \nconviction until 2009. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nalcohol consumption, only one of which may have application: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges he has an alcohol problem, that he relied on alcohol as \na reward for his hard work at his corporate employer, and that he should use other \nrewards in his life.  He has recently turned to family activities as a substitute for alcohol.  \nBut, despite his long history of alcohol abuse and problems, he never sought any \ncounseling or treatment until forced to do so by the court as part of his DUI conviction \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsentencing. His period of abstinence is only two months, too short in comparison to 28 \nyears of irresponsible alcohol abuse.  His evaluator states Applicant has alcoholism, \nand that he is only recently completing the recommendations made by the evaluator, \nincluding participation in AA for the past two months.  Therefore, it is too early to \ndetermine if Applicant has established a firm pattern of abstinence. This mitigating \ncondition has very limited application.   \n  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed \nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; and \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and, \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant also has a 28-year history of marijuana use, during which time he \npurchased it from drug dealers.  He possessed and used it.  He was arrested in a state \ncourthouse while going to court on a 2006 marijuana arrest because he had marijuana \nin his coat pocket.  He used marijuana continuously in some pattern over 28 years, and \ncocaine once in 1996, all while holding a security clearance.  He knew using controlled \nsubstances was a violation of the regulations pertaining to holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement, only one of which may be potentially applicable: \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant is in a court-ordered treatment program resulting from his DUI arrest \nand conviction. His exhibits do not address the drug treatment component of his \nprogram.  They only address his alcoholism and the recommendations for that issue.  \nThe court apparently did not prescribe a drug treatment program.  There is insufficient \nevidence that he has satisfactorily completed a prescribed drug treatment program or \nfavorable diagnosis by a qualified medical professional.  This mitigating condition has \nno applicability. \n  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.  These three conditions have applicability: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n9 \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and, \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant admitted deliberately failing to disclose on his March 2007 SCA his \nMarch 2007 marijuana possession, his 1996 marijuana possession, and the alcohol-\nrelated arrests in 1998, 2003, and 2006, because he was embarrassed and in a state of \ndenial.  He did not correct the information before being confronted with it by a \ngovernment investigator.  His conduct while having a security clearance created a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because, if disclosed, his marijuana \nuse would affect his professional standing.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  These two \nconditions may have some applicability: \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \nand, \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his drug use only after the court-ordered DUI treatment \nprogram.  There is no independent professional verification of his abstinence from 28 \nyears of marijuana use, albeit his assertions of periodic times over the course of those \n28 years.   His use of family activities to replace his marijuana use is of such short \nduration and lacking in support from his family, such that it is not persuasive.  He failed \nto provide sufficient evidence of said mitigating conditions to overcome his admissions \nthat he deliberately falsified his answers on his drug and alcohol arrests and use on his \nSCA in 1996 and 2007.   \n  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \n\n \n10 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is obviously a good \nworker and is well regarded by his supervisors and co-workers.  He tries to be a good \nfather.  But his overall 28-year history of alcohol and drug use, while holding a security \nclearance, shows he places his personal comfort over the Government requirements \nregarding classified information. There is a potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, \nor duress because of his arrests and use of alcohol and marijuana.  While he told his \nsupervisor recently of his usage of these substances, the duration of that use is longer \nand of more serious concern.  The overriding consideration in this case is that Applicant \nchose to use marijuana while holding a security clearance.  He also was involved in \nmultiple alcohol-related driving arrests, while holding a security clearance.  This conduct \ndemonstrates that Applicant is not trustworthy, has questionable judgment, and violates \nlaws and rules for his own comfort.  His drinking and marijuana use away from his \nfamily also shows intent to hide it from those closest to him, and if he would hide it from \nthem, he certainly would hide it from his employer and Government.  His recent \ndisclosures came only after being confronted with his history by an investigator. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 16, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On September 30, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J.\nTuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge made a factual error\nregarding the year of her high school graduation, and whether the Judge gave proper weight to\nApplicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation, including the documentation Applicant submitted during the\nperiod after the hearing when the record was left open for such submissions.\nApplicant requests reversal of the Judge\u2019s adverse decision, in part because the Judge stated\nthe year of her high school graduation as 1987 instead of 1997.  She also restates the circumstances\nof her financial difficulties.  To the extent that any of that information is new evidence that was not\nprovided at the hearing, the Board cannot consider it.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant states that\nthe Judge held the record open after the hearing for her to submit evidence of credit counseling and\nproof of payment of her debts.  Applicant maintains that the Judge stated that he would make his\ndecision after she submitted that documentation.  She argues that she provided documentation of\npayment of all her debts.\n  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Although Applicant points out an error with regard to the year of her high school\ngraduation, she has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are\nsustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n Once the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In his Findings of Fact, the Judge specifically\nreferred to Applicant\u2019s testimony of mitigating circumstances and to the documentation she\nsubmitted after the hearing.  Decision at 2-5.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2007).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against her financial history and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and factors.  Decision at 7-8.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\n\n3\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Id.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,  2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.
