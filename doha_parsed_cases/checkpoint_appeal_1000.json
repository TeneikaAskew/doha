On October 16, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nRobert Robinson Gales denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used and purchased marijuana between March 2018 and \nJuly 2023, that he used cocaine between April 2019 and September 2021, that he used ecstasy \nbetween July and August 2019, and that he used Adderall without a valid prescription between \nMay and November 2018.

In his December 2022 \ninitial security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he used marijuana from about March \n2018 to February 2022, and stated his intention against using the drug again. During his August \n2023 clearance interview, Applicant volunteered that he had used marijuana one additional time \nthe prior month and again asserted his intention to not use marijuana in the future. \nIn his May 2024 Answer to the SOR (Answer), Applicant admitted the alleged marijuana \nuse, explaining that, \u201cI used Marijuana a single time in July of 2023 after stopping use in February \nof 2022.

See File of Relevant Material (FORM) Item 4 \nat 5; FORM Item 5 at 6. \nThe erroneous finding that Applicant was employed in a sensitive position was harmful in \nthat it formed the basis of the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 25(f) and contributed to his conclusion \nthat Applicant\u2019s \u201ccontinued use of marijuana after July 2022 . . . raises questions about his \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Decision at 7. \nIn light of the foregoing, the best resolution of this case is to remand it to the Judge to \ncorrect the identified errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nS. Marshall Griffin, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 23, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nJanuary 8, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley \ndenied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nBackground \nDuring his January 2023 interview, Applicant disclosed that he had not filed federal or \nstate income tax returns for at least tax years 2012 through 2014 and acknowledged there may \nhave been additional years unfiled. He was confident that he owed no balance to either taxing \nauthority. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his July 2023 response to a first set of interrogatories, Applicant explained that he had \nnot filed his returns because he \u201calways got a refund\u201d and \u201cblew it off.\u201d File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) Item 5 at 2. He claimed to have begun working with a tax professional to file eight years \nof returns, which were \u201call almost ready to file.\u201d Id. Applicant also submitted documentation \nreflecting that his 2021 and 2022 federal tax returns were filed and that he had prepared, but not \nyet filed, his 2018 federal and state returns. \nOn May 10, 2024, in response to a second set of interrogatories, Applicant further disclosed \nthat his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2020 were unfiled, but that he was \nworking with a tax preparer and anticipated the returns would be filed within several days. FORM \nItem 4 at 2-4. He submitted new documentation that his 2023 federal return had also been filed. \nBased on the foregoing information, the SOR alleged under Guideline F that Applicant \nfailed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2020. Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on June 10, 2024, admitting both allegations and asserting that he had since \nfiled his federal returns for 2013 through 2020, for which he would have been due a refund, and \nhad filed his 2020 state return. He submitted no documentation in support of these assertions. \nHaving requested that his case be decided based on the written record, Applicant received \na complete copy of the Government\u2019s FORM on August 14, 2024, through which he was notified \nof his ability to respond with objections or additional information for the Judge to consider. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM and the Judge found against him on both allegations. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge failed to properly apply the Whole-\nPerson Concept and Guideline F mitigating conditions, which he argues amount to an abuse of \ndiscretion. Counsel\u2019s challenges are unpersuasive. \nNew Evidence \nWhile acknowledging that the Board generally cannot consider new evidence, Counsel \ncorrectly notes that we may consider new evidence insofar as it bears upon threshold issues \nof due process or jurisdiction. See ISCR Case No. 08-07664 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009). He \nfails, however, to identify any discernable due process or jurisdictional claim of error. We therefore \nremain precluded from considering Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplication of Mitigating Conditions \nNoting that Applicant\u2019s \u201cadmitted tax-filing failures are fully documented and create \njudgment issues over the management of his finances,\u201d the Judge reasonably found that the \nconduct raised disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), which considers the \u201cfailure to file . . . annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns.\u201d Counsel argues that the Judge thereafter erred in failing \nto apply mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(g).

Turning first to AG \u00b6 20(a), the condition affords mitigation when the alleged behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances making it unlikely to \nrecur. Here, Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax returns for nine years and, without any \nindependent documentation in the record to support resolution of those returns, that failure is \nongoing. Counsel\u2019s argument that AG \u00b6 20(a) should have been considered is without merit. \nWith respect to AG \u00b6 20(g), which affords mitigation when the individual has arranged \nwith the appropriate tax authority to file the outstanding returns, we agree that the condition was \nrelevant to the concerns raised in the SOR and that it was not explicitly identified in the decision \nas potentially applicable. If a provision of the Guidelines appears to apply to the facts of a particular \ncase, then the judge is obligated to either apply that provision or give a rational explanation for not \ndoing so. See ISCR Case No. 97-0825 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 1999). Under the facts of this case, \nan expectation that the Judge explicitly reference AG \u00b6 20(g) places form over function because \nthe Judge provided a rational explanation for declining its application when he specifically noted \nthe absence of \u201cany documented evidence of Applicant\u2019s timely resolving his federal and state tax-\nfiling failures\u201d to conclude that \u201cnone of the potentially available mitigating conditions are \navailable to him.\u201d Decision at 5. \nIn DOHA proceedings, it is the applicant\u2019s duty to present evidence sufficient to mitigate \nthe concerns established by the Government, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden of \npersuasion for obtaining a favorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. All applicants, \nincluding those that are pro se, are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their \nrights under the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). Throughout \nhis adjudication process, Applicant was afforded multiple opportunities to submit documentation \ncorroborating his resolution efforts, including in response to two sets of interrogatories and the \nSOR. In its FORM, the Government highlighted the lack of mitigating documentation in the \nrecord, noting that, \u201c[c]rucially, Applicant has failed to provide any documentation to support his \nclaims regarding his 2013-2020 Federal filings, and his 2020 state filing. Accordingly, there is \nminimal actual evidence of compliance.\u201d FORM at 3.

If he had evidence in support of his tax resolution efforts for \nthe Judge to consider, it was his obligation to provide that information in response to the FORM. \nFor whatever reason, he failed to do so. And, without such supporting documentation, the Judge \nacted well within his discretion in concluding that Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated assertions were \ninsufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nRegarding his analysis under the Whole-Person Concept, the Judge identified the AG \u00b6 \n2(d)1 factors and later found that, \u201c[w]hile Applicant is entitled to credit for his work in the defense \n1 AG \u00b6 2(d): In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the following \nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindustry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his repeated failures or inability to \ntimely file his federal and state income tax returns.\u201d Decision at 6. Counsel contends that the Judge \nfailed to address the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in a \u201cmeaningful\u201d or \u201ccomprehensive\u201d way and that, absent \nsuch error, the Judge \u201cwould have noted many factors applied to [Applicant].\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. \nThe Whole-Person Concept requires a judge to analyze an applicant\u2019s circumstances based \non consideration of the full record; however, a judge is not required to discuss each of the Whole-\nPerson factors and a decision does not turn simply on finding that one or more of them apply to \nthe facts of a particular case. See ISCR Case No. 11-08546 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 27, 2013). Counsel\u2019s \ncontention regarding the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s Whole-Person analysis both implicitly and \nexplicitly advocates for a different weighing of the evidence, which is insufficient to demonstrate \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citation \nomitted). For example, Counsel suggests that AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) and 2(d)(2) afford mitigation because \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file taxes \u201cwas not done maliciously or in an attempt to evade paying \ntaxes\u201d and a judge \u201ccould conclude that [Applicant] learned from his mistakes once he was \nfinancially stable [and] mature.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3, 4 (emphasis added). Such arguments ignore \nthe Board\u2019s clear and longstanding precedents regarding the implications of tax obligation \ncompliance on national security eligibility. \nIt is well-settled that an individual who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations \u2013 such \nas timely filing income tax returns \u2013 does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 98\u00ad\n0810 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000) (\u201cIt is untenable for an applicant to refuse to accept his or her \nlegal obligation to comply with the federal tax laws and then insist that the federal government \nmust grant him or her the privilege of handling classified information.\u201d). Contrary to Counsel\u2019s \nargument about Applicant\u2019s intent, disqualification under Guideline F is not limited to tax filing \nfailures done with nefarious intent or to avoid paying the resulting tax obligation. Rather, the \nDirective cites failure to file tax returns as a disqualifying condition in and of itself, irrespective \nof whether the underlying taxes have been paid, such as through withholding. Indeed, an \napplicant\u2019s legal obligation to timely file income tax returns is independent from whether he owes \nadditional taxes. See ISCR Case No. 94-0964, 1996 WL 648762 at *5 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996). \nCounsel\u2019s argument that Applicant has learned from his mistakes is also unpersuasive and \nhe points to nothing in the record to suggest that the Judge not agreeing was arbitrary or capricious. \nTo the contrary, and as reflected in the Judge\u2019s findings and repeatedly echoed herein, \u201cApplicant \nprovided no documentation of steps he has taken to file his tax returns for the years in issue.\u201d \nDecision at 2. The record below does not evidence Applicant having learned from and corrected \nhis mistakes, and the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Whole-Person analysis did not overcome the \nsecurity concern was reasonable and complies with the requirements of the Directive. \ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHearing Office Cases \nCounsel relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline F cases to suggest how \nthe Judge in this case could have differently applied the Whole-Person Concept and mitigating \nfactors. For multiple reasons, this reliance is misplaced. Each case must be decided on its own \nmerits. AG \u00b6 2(b). How particular fact scenarios were decided at the hearing level in other cases \nis generally not a relevant consideration in the Board\u2019s review of a case. The decisions that Counsel \ncites have no direct relationship or unique link to Applicant\u2019s case to make them relevant here. \nMoreover, while each of the cited cases involves the failure to file tax returns, the facts and \nconcerns at issue are distinguishable from the instant case, perhaps most glaringly in that the \napplicants in each cited case provided documentation that the previously delinquent tax returns \nhad been filed. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. In the instant case, the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the \ndisqualifying and mitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. \nThe record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The SOR further alleged under Guideline E that Applicant \ndeliberately falsified his response to interrogatories in 2023 and again in 2024, when he asserted \nincorrect dates for his last alcohol use. Finally, under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant \nfailed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2019 through 2023 and \nthat he carried a child support arrearage of approximately $10,000 and other delinquent consumer, \nauto, and utility accounts totaling approximately $38,000. \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations with explanation. The Judge \nfavorably resolved the criminal conduct cross-alleged under Guideline E and three of the financial \nconcerns totaling approximately $1,500. The Judge ruled adversely regarding all other allegations, \nand opined that, \nApplicant\u2019s total abuse of the court system trying to give him an \nopportunity to favorably resolve his extensive criminal record \nevidences a complete lack of responsibility and maturity. His \nfalsifications and delinquent debts also support an unfavorable \nwhole-person evaluation. Applicant claims he is a different person \nthan his criminal record would suggest. His behavior since his last \ncriminal offense in 2018 does not support his claim. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \nDecision at 17. \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nclaims of error with specificity.

The Judge found adversely to Applicant on all \nallegations. On appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge made factual errors, was biased against \nhim, and misapplied the Whole-Person Concept. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings \nApplicant is in his mid-fifties and has held a security clearance for more than 20 years, \nwith some breaks. Applicant\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce in 2019, and he married his current \nwife in 2020. He has four adult children. \nFinances \nIn 2006, Applicant financed the purchase of his home with a 30-year mortgage and a second \nmortgage that he described as a home equity line of credit (HELOC). The HELOC, now in issue \nat SOR \u00b6 1.a, was in the original amount of $59,600. The two credit reports in evidence show the \nlast activity date as 2018 or 2022 and the balance as either about $76,300 or about $80,300. Apart \nfrom this delinquent debt \u2013 his finances are in order. \nCriminal Conduct \nOn several occasions between 2020 and 2022, the police responded to calls at Applicant\u2019s \nhome. The Judge recited the facts from the police reports in considerable detail, noting that matters \nnot alleged in the SOR would not be used for disqualification purposes, but could be used to assess \nApplicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person \nanalysis. The summary below contains those facts from the Judge\u2019s decision most relevant to the \nappeal. \nPolice responded to Applicant\u2019s home in May 2020. Applicant reported that he and his \nwife had an argument that turned physical, during which his wife pulled out a pistol and fired it \nwithout hitting him. His wife was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, \ndischarging a firearm in the city, and disorderly conduct. She was convicted and placed on \nprobation. \nThe next incident, which took place later in 2020, is alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.b. In December \n2020, Applicant\u2019s wife called the police complaining that he was assaulting her. Applicant came \non the line and stated that his wife was on probation for domestic violence and was assaulting him. \nThe police response and investigation revealed a situation of mutual violence. Applicant\u2019s wife \nreported that Applicant had choked her and wanted to kill her. Applicant admitted that he choked \nhis wife but claimed that it was in self-defense after his wife attacked him, biting his arm and \nscratching his neck. The police reviewed footage from a video camera in the home that was \npartially blocked but showed some of the altercation, including instances of Applicant grabbing \nhis wife by the neck. Although the police believed that there might be probable cause to arrest both \nApplicant and his wife, they ultimately decided to arrest only Applicant. He was charged with \naggravated assault and domestic violence-strangulation impeding airway. The following month, \nboth Applicant and his wife recanted their statements to the police, and the district attorney \ndeclined to prosecute the charges against Applicant. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolice responded to the couple\u2019s home again in late January 2021 and in April 2022, the \nfirst time in response to a call from Applicant and, the second time, in response to calls from both \nhusband and wife. In the first instance, Applicant reported that his wife was destroying his \nproperty, that she struck him on the head, and that he grabbed her by the hair in self-defense and \nthrew her out of the room. In the second instance, the wife\u2019s mother reported that her daughter had \nan alcohol problem, and the police noted that she was visibly intoxicated. The police made no \narrests in either situation. \nIn September 2022, police again received a phone call from Applicant\u2019s address, and the \nresulting incident is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. The call came from a female, who was crying and said \nshe was tired of being beaten. As two police officers approached the house, Applicant was outside \nand yelled that the police should talk to his wife, that she was \u201cnuts,\u201d and that he was moving out. \nDecision at 5. The police report provides a detailed, lengthy description of the interaction between \nApplicant and the two officers. In summary, the report describes a situation in which Applicant, \nwho was much larger than either officer, first walked away, refusing to respond to the officers, \nthen swung at the officers when they tried to grab his arm, escalated the situation in response to \nthe officers\u2019 attempts to de-escalate, refused to put his hands behind his back, physically resisted \nbeing cuffed, had to be taken to the ground, and bit an officer. \nWhen the police interviewed Applicant\u2019s wife, she had scrapes on the right side of her face \nand arm. She described an argument that became physical, during which Applicant struck her on \nthe face with an open hand and threw her against a tree in the backyard. Applicant told the police \nthat his wife had an alcohol problem and was on probation for a driving under the influence charge. \nHe stated that she slipped and fell the previous evening but that he never touched her. When asked \nif he bit the police officer, Applicant responded, \u201cI will not deny it. I do not recall it. Biting is part \nof my training.\u201d Decision at 7 (quoting Government Exhibit 4). A photo of the officer showed a \nreddened circular area, consistent with a bite that did not break the skin. There was body camera \nfootage of the incident. \nApplicant was arrested for aggravated assault\u2013peace officer, assault\u2013minor injury, and \ndisorderly conduct. In September 2023, he pleaded guilty to a felony pursuant to a plea bargain \nand was sentenced to probation for 18 months. If Applicant successfully completes probation, the \nfelony conviction will be reduced to a misdemeanor. \nAt hearing, Applicant admitted that he was convicted for the latter incident but denied that \nhe did anything wrong in either alleged incident. He blamed the incidents on his mentally unstable \nwife with a drinking problem, attributed her injuries during the December 2020 incident to her \nfondness for rough sex, and discounted the video footage from that incident. Regarding the \nSeptember 2021 incident, Applicant blamed a corrupt and dishonest police force and denied biting \nthe officer. Applicant stated that he accepted the plea bargain for the September 2022 incident on \nthe advice of his attorney. He did not want to risk becoming a convicted felon and, under the terms \nof the plea bargain, the felony conviction will be reduced to a misdemeanor conviction upon \nsuccessful completion of probation. Applicant intends to sue the police department and the officer \nafter he completes probation. Regarding Applicant\u2019s testimony, the Judge stated: \u201cI did not find \nApplicant credible. After considering all the evidence, I find by substantial evidence that he \nassaulted his wife in December 2020, and he resisted arrest and assaulted a police officer in 2022.\u201d \nDecision at 8. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant is also on probation for an incident in March 2023 in which he violated a no-\ncontact order to remain away from his wife. He did not actually see his wife on the occasion, but \nhe met his daughter at his wife\u2019s home, which a judge considered a violation of the court order. \nApplicant was fined and placed on probation for about three years for the offense. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nGuidelines J and E \nApplicant\u2019s arrests for criminal offenses in December 2020 and September 2022 and the \nunderlying conduct establish disqualifying conditions under Guidelines J and E. In concluding that \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply, the Judge stated: \nApplicant blamed the incidents on his mentally unstable wife and a \ncorrupt and dishonest police force. I do not find his wife completely \nblameless in the matter. She was convicted on one occasion and \nparticipated at least to a degree in the December 2020 incident. . . . \nI find the police officer\u2019s description of the tape from the 2020 incident \nto be far more reliable than Applicant\u2019s version of the event. I further \nfind that his testimony about the incident was intentionally false. \nAs to the September 2022 arrest, that conduct was recorded on the \nofficers\u2019 body cameras. Additionally, Applicant pleaded guilty \npursuant to a plea bargain to a felony, which will be reduced to a \nmisdemeanor if he successfully completes probation. His probation \nremains in effect until 2025. I am convinced that he resisted arrest and \nassaulted a police officer. \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant is a licensed pilot with stringent rules. He stated that he is \njust as meticulous in how he handles classified information. However, \nhe failed to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct and provided \nfalse testimony about it at his hearing. The Appeal Board has held that \n\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge his misconduct or accept \nresponsibility for it seriously undercuts a finding that the applicant has \nmitigated his misconduct.\u201d \nSince I cannot trust Applicant\u2019s testimony, I cannot find that criminal \nconduct is unlikely to recur. . . . Criminal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \n. \n. \n. \nThe discussion under criminal conduct applies equally [to Guideline \nE]. I did not find Applicant credible.

I am \nunable to find that problematic conduct is unlikely to recur. His \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are sufficiently applicable to overcome \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s poor judgment and problematic conduct. \n[Id. at 10\u201312 (internal citations omitted).] \nGuideline F \nThe foreclosure on Applicant\u2019s home in about 2018 resolved the first mortgage but left \na second loan unpaid. Although Applicant may have been unable to pay the loan at some point, he \nhas since refused to pay it under any condition. Two disqualifying conditions are applicable: AG \u00b6 \n19(a), inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(b), unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so. \nApplicant stated that the house went into foreclosure because of his separation and divorce \nfrom his first wife. He had to move for his job, and she remained in the house without paying \nanything toward the loans. Applicant stated his beliefs that: he is not responsible for the loan \nbecause he let the primary and secondary lenders know that the house was going into foreclosure; \nthe creditor should have participated in the foreclosure; the creditor improperly changed the loan \nfrom a secured loan to an unsecured loan; and collections on the loan are barred by his state\u2019s \nstatute of limitations. As to his assertions that he does not owe the lender, Applicant provided no \nsupporting documentation. Regarding his argument that collection is barred, the Appeal Board has \nheld that \u201c[l]ittle mitigation is provided in security clearance cases when an applicant stands on a \nlegal defense such as the statute of limitations.\u201d Id. at 14 (citation omitted). The Judge concluded: \nThis is not a clear-cut case, even though I am unable to find any \nmitigating conditions applicable. There are no other financial matters \nof concern, and Applicant\u2019s separation and divorce played a part. \nUnder other circumstances I might have found this defaulted loan \nmitigated. However, Applicant\u2019s failure to accept any responsibility \nfor the matter causes me concern. He does not feel like he benefitted \n\u201cin any way\u201d from the loan because he \u201cput that money back into the \nhouse to try and fix it up and make it better.\u201d That is an unreasonable \nposition. Additionally, I am required to consider the whole person and \nnot address individual allegations in a piecemeal manner. His failure \nto accept responsibility for his financial problems is similar to his \nfailure to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct. \nApplicant does not have a track record that would indicate that this \ndefaulted loan will be resolved within a reasonable period. He did not \nact responsibly under the circumstances, and he did not make a good-\nfaith effort to pay his debt. The unpaid debt continues to cast doubt on \nhis current judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nFinancial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated.

I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, F, and J in my whole-person analysis. As a pilot, \nApplicant is trusted to navigate the nation\u2019s airways. However, he is \na convicted felon on probation, and he is willing to lie if he believes \nit will benefit him. He cannot be trusted with our nation\u2019s secrets. [Id. \nat 14-15.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that \u201cthere are many errors, both factual and assumptive with \nthe judge\u2019s findings\u201d and that \u201cthe judge and the prosecutor allowed their personal biases and \nbeliefs to impede their judgment and infringe on their impartiality.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. \nAdditionally, he argues that the Judge failed in his application of the Whole-Person Concept. \nWe turn first to Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge erred in his findings of fact. When a \njudge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether \u201c[t]he Administrative \nJudge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept \nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant does not identify any specific finding of fact that is wrong, but \nhis appeal takes broad aim at the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he assaulted his wife in December 2020 \nand that he resisted arrest and assaulted a police officer in September 2022. \nIn his brief, Applicant re-states several of his arguments from the hearing as to the first \nincident\u2014that his wife \u201chas a few issues,\u201d that she has \u201ca very short fuse,\u201d and that she \u201calso \ndrinks heavily.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. As to the second incident, Applicant reiterates his argument \nthat he did not bite the officer, as evidenced by the fact that there was no broken skin. Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]hese facts appear to have been completely dismissed by the judge,\u201d \nthe Judge\u2019s lengthy decision explicitly considers and weighs all the evidence that Applicant claims \nwas ignored. Our review confirms that the Judge\u2019s findings \u201creflect a reasonable interpretation of \nthe record evidence as a whole\u201d and that there is no \u201cevidence that fairly detracts from the weight \nof the evidence supporting those findings.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \nWe conclude that this assignment of error is without merit.1 \n1 As a general rule, the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in DOHA proceedings, under which Applicant would \nnot be permitted to contend that he did not engage in the criminal acts of September 2022 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) for which he \nwas convicted. E.g., ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 7\u20138 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006). Here, the Judge elected to resolve \nboth the 2020 and the 2022 incidents on their merits, rather than to apply collateral estoppel to the latter. Because the \nJudge\u2019s findings and conclusions are amply supported by record evidence and his election not to apply collateral \nestoppel was not challenged by the Government, we decline to address whether this case warranted any exception to \nthe general rule (e.g., on the grounds that Applicant\u2019s plea bargain \u201ccreate[d] an actual disincentive to litigate\u201d the \ncharges).

E.g., ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n28, 2005). Department Counsel represent the Government\u2019s interests in these proceedings and are \nnot required to be neutral, impartial, or unbiased. In performing their professional responsibilities, \nDepartment Counsel are routinely expected to advocate in a manner that is contrary to an \napplicant\u2019s positions or interests. A claim of bias against a Department Counsel is not an \nappealable issue. ISCR Case No. 19-00883 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2022). \nTo the extent that Applicant is instead claiming Department Counsel acted in an unfair or \ninappropriate manner, there is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials carry out their duties \nin good faith. E.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001). A party seeking to rebut \nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. Here, Applicant does not carry his \nburden. Applicant fails to identify anything in the record below that suggests a basis for a \nreasonable person to conclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, unfairly, or \nunprofessionally, nor does he cite specific portions of the transcript or decision in support of his \nallegation, as required by the Directive. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30 (the appeal brief must state the specific \nissue or issues being raised and cite specific portions of the case record supporting any alleged \nerror). This assignment of error is without merit. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge was biased. Again, Applicant fails to cite specific \nportions of the transcript or decision in support of his allegation. In the context of the assault on \nthe police officer, however, Applicant makes the following broad assertion: \u201c[T]he judge \ndismissed my explanations because, in my opinion, his values, beliefs, and [the] way he lives his \nlife is much different from me. His values, beliefs and lifestyle is no better or worse than mine. It \nis different.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. \nWe do not find this vague and undefined argument of bias persuasive. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that a judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that \npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. The issue is not whether Applicant personally \nbelieves that the Judge was biased or prejudiced against him but, rather, whether the record \n\u201ccontains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to \nquestion the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. \n27, 2003). Having examined the record, paying particular attention to the transcript, we find \nnothing that would persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite \nimpartiality, and Applicant points us to nothing that supports his claim. \nApplicant does not directly challenge the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination, \nalthough this case rests largely on the fact that the Judge simply did not believe Applicant. Upon \nhis review of the evidence in this case \u2013 to include Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing \u2013 the Judge \nmade several discrete conclusions regarding credibility, to include: that Applicant was not \ncredible; that the police reports on the instances of alleged criminal conduct were more reliable \nthan Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding those same events; that Applicant\u2019s testimony about the 2020 \nevent was \u201cintentionally false\u201d; and that Applicant \u201cis willing to lie if he believes it will benefit \nhim.\u201d Decision at 8, 10, 15. The Directive requires the Appeal Board to give deference to a judge\u2019s \ncredibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. The Judge\u2019s credibility assessments in this case \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nare well within his authority, and nothing in Applicant\u2019s brief or in our review of the record gives \nus reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s adverse determination. \nIn his final argument, Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in his Whole Person analysis, \nbut his argument merely advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our \nreview of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of the Navy v.

Applicant characterized the nature of his use as \u201c[v]ery, very rare,\u201d \nestimated having \u201cused marijuana about a dozen times in the past seven years,\u201d and asserted that \nhe had \u201c[o]nly one use on a holiday during the past four years.\u201d GE 1 at 40. He stated that he had \nno interest or intention to use marijuana again in the future. Id. \nSubsequently, during his January 2023 interview, Applicant expanded upon the details of \nhis historical marijuana use, which he reiterated began in 1991 and continued with fluctuating \nfrequency comingled with lengthy periods of abstinence, now through December 2022.1 Regarding \nwhy he omitted the use from his 2019 SCA, Applicant explained that he believed he did not need \nto list it because the frequency and amount was minimal. GE 7 at 4. He again stated that he had no \nintention to use marijuana in the future. Id. \nBased on the foregoing, the SOR, as amended, alleged under Guideline H that Applicant \nused marijuana with varying frequency from 1991 to at least April 2022, including after December \n2021 while occupying a sensitive position. The SOR further alleged under Guideline E that \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his marijuana use on his 2019 SCA. \nIn his April 2024 response to the amended SOR, Applicant admitted the concerns with \nexplanation, and \u201cemphatically state[d]\u201d that he is \u201cnot a regular user of marijuana and [has] not \nbeen since college.\u201d SOR Response at 1. He again provided a detailed, but different chronology of \nhis marijuana use history, still beginning in 1991 and continuing with fluctuating frequency \ncomingled with lengthy periods of abstinence, now until September 2023.2 Applicant again \naverred that he would not use marijuana again. \n1 During his January 2023 interview, Applicant estimated that he used marijuana as follows: four times per week from \nJanuary 1991 to 1993; once per month from 1993 to 1995; abstained from 1995 to 2003; twice annually from 2003 to \n2008; abstained from 2008 to December 2012; once per week from December 2012 to July 2013; abstained from July \n2013 to 2017/2018; once per month from 2017/2018 to January 2019; abstained from January 2019 to December \n2021; and three to four times per year during the Christmas holiday since December 2021. GE 7 at 3. \n2 In his April 2024 SOR Response, Applicant estimated that he used marijuana as follows: several times per month, \nthen three or four times per week, and finally monthly between 1991 and 1994: abstained from 1994 to mid-2000s; \ntwice annually from mid-2000s to about 2011; abstained from January 2012 to early 2013; less than 10 times in early \n2013; abstained from about mid-2013 to late 2015/early 2016; less than three times per month from late 2015/early \n2016 to late 2017; abstained from late 2017 to about January 2019; once in about January 2019; abstained from about \nJanuary 2019 to December 2021; rarely from December 2021 to July 2022; abstained from July 2022 to December \n2022; and rarely from December 2022 to September 2023.

In concluding that \nthe Guideline E concern was not mitigated, the Judge opined that Applicant demonstrated poor \njudgment in falsifying his 2019 SCA, especially because \u201che is highly educated and should have \nknown he needed to answer fully and truthfully,\u201d and his subsequent disclosures were \u201cneither \nprompt nor complete.\u201d Decision at 9. Moreover, Applicant used marijuana after and despite stating \nthat he did not intend to use the drug again. \nGuideline J \nIn January 2013, Applicant was playing a song he created for his children on his laptop, \nand his wife shut the laptop hard because she did not want their children exposed to rock music. \nHe claimed that his wife proceeded to scream at him for half an hour. When Applicant attempted \nto leave the situation and take the children to their grandmother\u2019s house, his wife threatened to call \nthe police and started to dial 911. Applicant testified that he grabbed the phone and \u201cstiff-armed\u201d \nher to stop her from calling 911. Id. at 3 (citing Tr. at 83). The wife testified that Applicant threw \nher on the floor, and that she hit her head and sought medical treatment. She testified that she was \ndiagnosed with a mild concussion, while Applicant testified that the tests for concussion were \nnegative. The hospital notified the police, and Applicant was arrested and charged with Disorderly \nConduct (domestic violence) and Battery. The Battery charge was subsequently dismissed, and \nApplicant was placed on six months\u2019 probation for the Disorderly Conduct charge. \nIn July 2022, Applicant and his wife were involved in another incident that began with a \nverbal dispute, but which became physical, and she hit her head. She testified that Applicant \npushed her hard into the wall, and he asserted that he grabbed her shoulders, she pushed him, and \nthen he pushed her back. She went to the hospital and was diagnosed with a concussion. Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with Assault on a Female. He entered into a deferred prosecution \nagreement and was placed on probation for one year and required to participate in counseling. \nAfter successfully completing the terms of his probation, the charges were dismissed in August \n2023. \nAt hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife testified that their relationship is struggling, that they argue \ndaily, and that he has spat on her, but never hit her. She indicated that she angers easily and has \nprovoked him. In response to whether she believes Applicant is a truthful person, his wife \nresponded that his arranging dates with other women is dishonest and that he was not honest about \nmoney. Applicant entered videos into evidence, some of which he contended reflect that he has \nbeen an unretaliating victim of his wife\u2019s abusive behavior, including several that depict her yelling \nand, in one, throwing food at him. \nThe Judge assessed that the \u201cvolatility that led to the domestic incidents is not unusual\u201d in \nApplicant\u2019s marital home and is ongoing. Decision at 8. As a result, and especially considering the \nwife\u2019s reports that Applicant has spat on her, the Judge was unable to conclude that he is \nrehabilitated or that the Guideline J concern was mitigated. Overall, the Judge concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201chistory of drug involvement, criminal conduct, and falsification creates questions \nabout his trustworthiness\u201d and ruled adversely on all concerns.

Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. There is \nno presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity \nand identify how the judge committed factual or legal error. \nWhen a judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether the \nfindings \u201care supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record\u201d and shall give \ndeference to the judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nWhen a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary \nor capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge was biased against him and challenges her \nfactual findings and mitigation analysis. For the following reasons, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nChallenges to Findings of Fact \nTurning first to the 2013 incident and Applicant\u2019s related assignment of factual error, the \nJudge found that, \u201c[a]ccording to the FBI rap sheet in evidence, the Battery charge was dismissed, \nbut he was convicted of Disorderly Conduct and placed on probation. Applicant claims he was not \nconvicted of this charge.\u201d Decision at 3. Arguing that he has \u201cnever been convicted of any crime,\u201d \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding as a \u201cserious error [that] should suffice to reverse her \ndecision.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We disagree. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s repeated assertion to the contrary, his FBI Criminal History Record \nindicates that he was convicted of Disorderly Conduct (domestic abuse) on March 12, 2013, and \nplaced on probation for six months, following which the charge was dismissed on September 17, \n2013. See GE 4 at 7-8.3 The language Applicant challenges in the Judge\u2019s decision does not reflect \n3 On appeal, in support of his contention that he was never convicted of the crime, Applicant submits the Motion and \nOrder to Dismiss that dismissed the case based on Applicant\u2019s successful completion of the conditions in his Diversion \nAgreement. This document constitutes new evidence, which the Board may not consider. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.

Moreover, even if the Judge had \nentered such a finding, it would be supported by the evidence and reflect a reasonable and \nsustainable weighing of the FBI record against Applicant\u2019s explanation. \nApplicant also renews his objection to the Government\u2019s use of the term \u201cvarying \nfrequency\u201d to characterize his marijuana use history and challenges the Judge\u2019s use of the term in \nher factual findings as \u201can inaccurate and possible [sic] even slanderous mischaracterization of \n[his] use.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. During his current adjudication, Applicant provided multiple, varying \nestimates of his periods of marijuana use and abstinence since 1991. In her findings of fact, the \nJudge summarized that \u201cApplicant has used marijuana at varying frequencies since 1991\u201d before \nidentifying some of his estimated periods of use and abstinence, as reported by him, through \nSeptember 2023. Decision at 2-3. It is unclear how the term \u201cvarying frequency\u201d is inaccurate, let \nalone slanderous, on its own, but especially when followed by a comprehensive breakdown of his \nuse over more than 30 years, and we are unpersuaded that this constitutes any error. \nAllegation of Bias \nApplicant argues that the Judge was \u201cprejudiced against [him]\u201d and suggests that either \n\u201cgender bias\u201d or his wife\u2019s emotional testimony influenced the Judge to ultimately downplay his \nwife\u2019s acts of aggression and overemphasize his two arrests. Appeal Brief at 1. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that administrative judges are impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to \novercome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001) (citations omitted). The issue is not whether the appealing party \npersonally believes that the judge was biased or prejudiced but, rather, whether the record contains \nany indication that the judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the \njudge\u2019s fairness or impartiality. Id. Having examined the record, paying particular attention to the \ntranscript, we find no such indication. Nothing in the record below or the Judge\u2019s decision supports \nApplicant\u2019s claims of bias. \nCredibility Determination and Applicant\u2019s Future Intent \nIn her Guideline H mitigating analysis, the Judge concluded that Applicant failed to \nestablish that his marijuana use is unlikely to recur, citing that \u201che has had long periods of \nabstaining from marijuana use, but has, as he put it, \u2018relapsed.\u2019\u201d Decision at 7. The Judge also \nquestioned Applicant\u2019s credibility and current claims of abstinence \u201cgiven his history of lying \nabout his marijuana use . . . and lying to [his wife] about dating other women and about finances.\u201d \nId. \nApplicant assigns multiple errors to the foregoing analysis, beginning with her use of the \nword \u201crelapse\u201d to characterize his instances of resuming marijuana use after periods of abstaining. \nHis challenge to this word fails for several reasons, not the least of which is that Applicant \nif the Board could consider the new evidence, it would not impact our review of this case. The document does not \nestablish that Applicant was not convicted of the charge, but instead that his case was dismissed, which suggests that \ndismissal followed successful completion of a post-conviction diversion program. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintroduced the term into the record to describe how he came to use marijuana again each time.4 \nThe Judge then used the word twice in her decision, each time contained in quotation marks to \nrefer to Applicant\u2019s original characterization and once while specifically identifying that origin. \nWe are unpersuaded that, considering the source and context of its use, the Judge\u2019s use of the word \n\u201crelapse\u201d constitutes harmful error or contributed to an arbitrary and capricious decision. \nNext, in a set of related arguments, Applicant charges that the Judge failed to properly \nconsider the \u201ccontext and frequency\u201d of his marijuana use, reiterates that his various disclosures \nwere estimates made \u201cto the best of [his] recollection,\u201d and challenges the Judge\u2019s negative \ncredibility assessment, asserting that, \u201c[t]he only reason why the government is aware of any \nmarijuana use is because I have been totally honest about it, especially during and since the subject \ninterview in 202[3].\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. \nAs an initial matter, Applicant\u2019s assertion about being \u201ctotally honest\u201d is flatly contradicted \nby the record. His first opportunity to disclose his marijuana use occurred in completing his 2019 \nSCA, which covered a reporting period beginning May 2012. Based on the information later \nprovided in his 2023 interview, Applicant should have reported weekly marijuana use from \nDecember 2012 to July 2013 and monthly use from 2017 or 2018 until January 2019.5 \nAlternatively, based on the information provided in response to the SOR or at hearing, Applicant \nshould have reported using marijuana five to ten times in 2013, monthly from late 2015 or early \n2016 to late 2017, and once in about January 2019.6 Instead, Applicant affirmatively asserted in \nhis 2019 SCA that he had not illegally used any drugs since May 2012. This was categorically \nfalse, as is his statement on appeal that he has \u201cbeen totally honest about\u201d his marijuana use. It was \nnot until his triggered reinvestigation and completion of a new SCA in 2022 that Applicant began \nto disclose any marijuana use, and even that proved inconsistent with his subsequent disclosures. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s focus on specific periods and frequencies of marijuana use \noverlooks the more significant concerns under Guidelines E and H \u2013 that he intentionally omitted \nany marijuana use from his original SCA and, at some point after being granted national security \neligibility and while holding a sensitive position, resumed using marijuana, including while his \ncurrent investigation was ongoing. The security significance of both types of misconduct is well-\nestablished, casting serious doubt on an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness.7 \n4 See SOR Response at 1 (\u201cEven during my brief relapses with marijuana . . .\u201d). At hearing, Applicant explained that \nthe word \u201crelapse\u201d was intended to describe that he does not \u201ctake it lightly\u201d that he resumed marijuana use.

Applicant asserted in his October 2022 SCA that he had neither intention nor interest \nin using marijuana again. Just two months later during the 2022 Christmas holiday, however, he \ndid. During his interview the following month, he again stated that he had no intention to use \nmarijuana in the future. Despite that statement against future use, he apparently continued to use \nmarijuana, albeit \u201crarely\u201d, through September 2023. Applicant used marijuana while occupying a \nsensitive position, while his national security eligibility adjudication was ongoing, and while \nconcurrently espousing no future intent, all of which reflect a complete disregard for national \nsecurity eligibility standards. His latest assurances of lessons learned and future abstinence are due \nlittle, if any, weight. The Judge\u2019s unfavorable credibility determination is amply supported by the \nrecord, as is her reliant mitigation analysis, and we find no cause to disturb either on appeal. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

On \nAugust 12, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Candace Le\u2019i \nGarcia denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nThe SOR initially alleged five delinquent consumer accounts totaling approximately \n$28,500. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all five allegations. At his hearing in early \nFebruary 2025, Applicant disclosed that he owed approximately $10,000 in federal taxes, and the \nGovernment moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence, adding an allegation that \nApplicant was indebted to the federal government in the approximate amount of $10,000 for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nunpaid taxes. Applicant denied this allegation as well, and a second hearing was held in late \nFebruary 2025 to address the new allegation. At the second hearing, the Judge received additional \ntestimony from Applicant on the tax allegation and admitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) G. The Judge \nkept the record open until March 10, 2025, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments but noted in her decision that Applicant failed to submit anything further. The Judge \nfound favorably for Applicant on one consumer debt and adversely on the other four consumer \ndebts and on the tax allegation. \nOn appeal, Applicant focuses exclusively on the tax allegation. He contends that the Judge \n\u201cerred as a matter of fact and law by failing to find that the Applicant had established a \u2018good\u00ad\nfaith effort\u2019 to resolve the tax debt,\u201d that she failed to consider \u201chis consistent cooperation with \nthe IRS,\u201d and that she \u201coverlooked key record evidence and minimized the Applicant\u2019s testimony \nand [AE] G, raising due process concerns regarding the fair evaluation of the record.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 5 (emphasis in original). In support of these arguments, Applicant implies that he submitted \ndocuments post-hearing to the Judge that were not considered in her decision, asserting: \u201cThe \nJudge acknowledged that only a single-page excerpt of the IRS transcript was submitted at the \nhearing, even though the record was left open until March 10 for full submissions. The final \ndecision did not reflect consideration of this complete record, suggesting mitigating evidence was \neither overlooked or undervalued.\u201d Id. at 6 (emphasis in original). Elsewhere in his Appeal \nBrief, Applicant makes a contradictory assertion \u2014 that he provided eight pages of IRS tax \ndocuments in AE G. Id. at 4. \nOur review of the record establishes that AE G consisted of eight pages, of which seven \npertain to various consumer debts. AE G at 1\u20135, 7\u20138. There is a single page that is recognizable as \npart of an IRS tax account transcript. Id. at 6. Because it is not the first page of the transcript, it is \nimpossible to know what tax year it pertains to, but it documents activity beginning in May 2017 \nand ending in October 2023. The excerpt substantiates Applicant\u2019s testimony in two regards: that \nhe made two payments of $250\u2014in September and October 2018\u2014and that the IRS determined \nin early 2020 that the account was currently not collectible due to hardship. Id. The Judge explicitly \nconsidered those facts in her decision prior to resolving this allegation adversely. Decision at 4, 6. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s ambiguous and contradictory references to submitting further documentation, \nwe find nothing in the record or his brief to corroborate these claims. He provides no details \nwhatsoever about any further submissions or a copy of what was purportedly emailed. Applicant\u2019s \nvague suggestion that he provided documents is not sufficient to establish a prima facie showing \nthat he actually submitted additional evidence or documents that were not included in the record. \nApplicant has not established that he was denied the due process afforded by the Directive. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. None of his arguments, however, are sufficient to establish the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should be \ngranted any relief on appeal. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On April 9, 2025, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Eric H. Borgstrom denied Applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant was indebted on 15 delinquent \nconsumer accounts, had two Federal tax liens filed against him, and was delinquent on state taxes. \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant alleges that the Judge erred in his decision because he \u201cmade \nsignificant progress to clearing up all financial debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1.

Consistent with the following, we \naffirm. \nFindings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 40s and has been employed by a federal contractor since November \n2023. He has never married and has no children. \nSince June 2017, Applicant has been employed by several different private companies for \nshort stints, and he was involuntarily terminated from each position. In his security clearance \napplication, he explained his terminations as he was \u201clet go for unclear circumstances that appeared \nto be due to budget cuts, political issues, and changes in management within the organization.\u201d \nGovernment Exhibit 1 at 14. He also attributed his terminations to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the \nhearing, he could not provide any greater clarity as to whether he was terminated for cause or laid \noff, but he remained eligible for and did receive unemployment compensation while he was \nunemployed. \nFrom June 2017 to December 2018, Applicant was employed in procurement for a private \ncompany. From December 2018 to December 2019, he was employed as a business development \nmanager, earning an annualized salary of approximately $90,000. From January 2020 to March \n2020, he was employed as a purchasing manager, earning approximately an annualized salary of \n$75,000-80,000. He was unemployed from March 2020 to May 2021, and he received \nunemployment compensation. From May 2021 to November 2023, he worked in purchasing at four \ndifferent companies, earning an annualized salary between $80,000 and $120,000. He also had a \nshort period of unemployment between July 2022 and October 2022. Since November 2023, he has \nbeen employed with a DoD contractor, currently earning approximately $119,000 annually. \nThe Judge examined each SOR debt individually and found that Applicant had either paid \nthe debt in full or satisfied the judgment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.k, 1.n) or settled the debt for less than \nwas due with the remainder largely being cancelled by the creditor (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.j, 1.l, 1.m). SOR \n\u00b6 1.o was a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.g and was found in Applicant\u2019s favor to avoid duplicative \nallegations. With respect to the two Federal tax liens filed against Applicant (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q), \nthe Judge found that \u201csince July 2024, Applicant has made nine payments of $670 each in \naccordance with an installment agreement.\u201d Decision at 5. The Judge found that Applicant paid \nhis delinquent state taxes in May 2024 (SOR \u00b6 1.r). \nThe Judge examined the relevant causes for Applicant\u2019s delinquencies. He noted that \nApplicant testified his financial delinquencies did not occur until he became unemployed in March \n2020. In addition to his unemployment, he attributed his financial problems to financially supporting \nhis mother, father, and brother and to liquidating his retirement savings to purchase a home. In late \n2019, he liquidated more than $100,000 in retirement savings to purchase and furnish a home, \ntriggering significant federal and state income tax consequences. He admitted that he was aware of \nthe potential tax liability at the time he liquidated his retirement accounts. \nThe Judge gave great weight to Applicant\u2019s financial decisions since 2020. He noted \nApplicant currently provides $300-800 in monthly support to his mother and approximately $300 in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmonthly support to his father. His parents are divorced. He had previously provided as much as $800\u00ad\n1,000 a month to support his father. His brother and his brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e reside with him. Since \nJanuary 2020, he charged his brother approximately $1,500 a month in rent; however, he has not \ncollected rent from his brother, who is gainfully employed, for about a year, to allow his brother to \nsave for his wedding. His brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e does not pay any rent. Applicant\u2019s financial support of \nhis family members continued even while he was unemployed. He used his savings and credit cards \nto support his family members. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he currently had approximately $300,000 in \ninvestment assets, after having liquidated $70,000-80,000 to settle his delinquent accounts. He \nfurther testified that this balance had grown from approximately $50,000 as of 2020 and that he had \ninsufficient funds to pay his delinquent debts and taxes until recently. When questioned why he did \nnot resolve all of his debts and taxes given his investments, he explained that his top priority was \nresolving the credit card accounts. He was reluctant to liquidate any more investments and incur \nadditional tax liability. He also estimated that he had approximately $350,000 in equity in his home; \nhowever, he had decided not to utilize that equity to resolve any of his delinquent debt. He expressed \nhis desire to retain sufficient assets to retire comfortably. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided an account statement for his investment account. As \nof December 31, 2024, he had approximately $1,017,000 in assets in a brokerage account, including \n$192,000 in gains from 2024. He testified that he had this investment account in 2020; however, he \ndid not have sufficient resources to pay down his large debts. \nApplicant purchased his home in January 2020. He remained in this home, with his brother, \nbut he did not pay his mortgage from May 2020 until November 2022. He has since refinanced his \nmortgage, cashing out approximately $20,000 in equity, which he used to pay bills while \nunemployed. He has not missed a mortgage payment since November 2022, paying $3,400 a month. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions and \npresents new evidence. In deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we \nreview the decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nRelative to mitigation, Applicant argues that the Judge errored in his analysis that he could \nhave addressed his delinquent debts in a more timely manner. The Judge noted, \u201cthe timing of his \nactions indicates that his debt-resolution efforts were triggered by court judgments and the SOR \nissuance and not good faith.\u201d Decision at 10. Applicant explained that his delay in attending to his \ndebts until after receiving the SOR was due to hardships in his life and that he did not have the \nassets available until 2024 to address the delinquencies. However, this assertion is not fully \nsupported by record evidence.

While those are factors \nthe Judge considered with respect to mitigation and the Whole-Person Concept, repayment alone \ndoes not establish mitigation.1 A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ninducing an applicant to meet his duty to repay delinquent debts or file tax returns. Rather, it is a \nproceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). Accordingly, even though Applicant \neventually set up a payment plan for his federal tax debt and resolved his other delinquencies, the \nJudge properly considered all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely resolve his financial obligations. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Here, the Judge considered the status of each \ndebt in detail but found that the circumstances surrounding the repayment of the debts outweighed \nthe mitigation presented. The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s \u201creluctance to address and resolve his \ndelinquencies [was] exacerbated by his significant available assets.\u201d Decision at 11.

However, the presence of some favorable \nor mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable security clearance decision and, given the \nscope of Applicant\u2019s prior drug use, the Judge found that insufficient time had passed to establish \na pattern of abstinence.1 Decision at 5. \nOn appeal, Applicant provides new evidence in the form of recent drug test results.

Mendez, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 29, 2024, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing, \nwhich was held on August 6, 2024. On November 20, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we \naffirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers in Iraq, some of whom are connected to the Iraqi government. In his response to the SOR \nApplicant admitted all allegations. The Judge found against Applicant as to six of the allegations \nand in his favor as to two others. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant broadly alleges that the Judge made factual errors but does not \nchallenge any specific factual findings. Rather, he argues that the Judge did not appropriately \nweigh the facts relative to the Mitigating Conditions and whole-person analysis. This challenge \nlargely conflates \u201cfacts\u201d with \u201cconclusions.\u201d However, regardless of this, the allegations of error \nare without merit because the Judge\u2019s factual findings and conclusions are amply supported by the \nrecord. The Judge adequately addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances in her decision and reasonably \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s Iraqi relatives pose an unmitigated security concern. \nIn essence, Applicant is advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence. The mere presence of \nsome favorable or mitigating evidence does not require the Judge to make an overall favorable \ndetermination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as Applicant\u2019s. E.g. ISCR Case No. 04\u00ad\n08975 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and \narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Prior to \nsubmission of the case to the Administrative Judge, the Government withdrew the Guideline J \nallegation and added further allegations under Guidelines E and F. The Judge found favorably for \nApplicant on the Guideline E allegations. The Judge found adversely to Applicant on the sole \nGuideline H allegation\u2014that he used marijuana between November 2020 and December 2021 \nwhile in a sensitive position, i.e., one in which he held a security clearance.

Directive E3.1.29. The \nBoard\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the \nJudge committed harmful error. Because Applicant has not made such an allegation of error, the \ndecision of the Judge denying Applicant eligibility for a public trust position is sustainable. \n1 With his appeal, Applicant includes a signed Statement of Intent (SOI) to abstain from drug use, dated September \n12, 2024.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 23, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nJanuary 8, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Philip J. \nKatauskas denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2018 through 2022 and owed a federal tax balance of about $5,400. In \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted the tax concerns, explaining that all returns had been \nfiled and that he was on a repayment plan for the federal tax debt, and he requested that his case \nbe decided based on the written record.

Applicant did not \nrespond to the FORM and the Judge found against him on all allegations. On appeal, Applicant \nchallenges two findings regarding evidence that he contends he provided but that was not \nconsidered. For the following reasons, Applicant\u2019s challenges are unpersuasive. \nThe record reflects the following information pertinent to his tax filing history and \nproduction of evidence in this matter. In his April 2023 security clearance application, Applicant \ndisclosed that he failed to file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2020 through 2022 and \nasserted that he was working to file the returns and pay the balance through payment plans. During \nhis May 2023 interview, he clarified that only his 2020 and 2021 returns were outstanding and that \nhe planned to contact a tax filing company the next month for help filing the returns. He asserted \nthat he timely filed both his 2019 and 2022 returns. \nThe Government subsequently issued three sets of interrogatories seeking further \ninformation and documentation regarding Applicant\u2019s outstanding taxes, the responses to which \nreflected inconsistencies to his prior assertions and internally among the responses. In his August \n2023 response to the first set, Applicant explained that he \u201crecently filed [his] taxes for 2020\u201d and \nanticipated the remaining two tax years to be filed by the end of August. FORM Item 3 at 3. The \ninterrogatories instructed Applicant to produce copies of his federal and state tax account \ntranscripts for tax years 2020 to 2022 and provided him with step-by-step instructions to obtain \nthem. Applicant, however, submitted only copies of his Employer W2 Information for years 2019 \nthrough 2021 and his W-2 Wage and Tax Statement for 2022. \nIn his February 2024 response to the second interrogatories, Applicant asserted that his \nreturns for the 2020 through 2022 tax years had since been filed. Once again, although instructed \nto produce his 2020 to 2022 federal and state tax account transcripts with accompanying step-by\u00ad\nstep directions, Applicant submitted only duplicative copies of his Employer W2 Information for \nyears 2020 and 2021. \nFinally, in his May 2024 response to a third set of interrogatories, Applicant revealed that \nhis federal and state tax returns were late filed as follows: tax years 2019 and 2020 in September \n2023, tax year 2021 in February 2024, and tax year 2022 in April 2024. Additionally, his 2018 \nreturns remained unfiled and his 2019 federal return carried an outstanding balance of about \n$5,400. Despite that Applicant was again given instructions to produce his federal tax account \ntranscripts for tax years 2019 through 2022, he produced only copies of his Employer W2 \nInformation for years 2019 through 2022. \nIn his analysis, the Judge found that, \u201cin three sets of interrogatories, [Applicant] was \nrequested for his relevant IRS Tax Transcripts [and] given express instructions on how to obtain \nthose Transcripts. Yet he did not provide those Transcripts.\u201d Decision at 5. Applicant challenges \nthis finding and contends that he \u201csent the information requested for [his] tax transcripts for the \nyears 2018-2022.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. In support of this argument, he attached copies of the same \nEmployer W2 Information images produced in response to interrogatories. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he submitted his tax account transcripts appears to be based on \nhis persistent misunderstanding about the documentation being referenced. In sum, the documents \nto which Applicant refers on appeal as \u201ctax transcripts\u201d were included in the Government\u2019s FORM \nand considered by the Judge. See Decision at 2-3 (citing Item 3 at 8-11; Item 4 at 8-10; Item 5 at \n12-14). Those documents are not, however, tax account transcripts, which are official summaries \nof tax filings that evidence the filing status and any outstanding balance for each tax year. Despite \nthe Government\u2019s specific and repeated requests for Applicant to produce those transcripts through \ninterrogatories, he did not. Nor did Applicant address that lack of evidence in response to the \nGovernment\u2019s argument that Applicant had failed to mitigate the SOR concerns because, \u201cdespite \nthree separate requests with clear, unambiguous directions on how to do so, he has failed to provide \nany proof\u201d to support his filing of the tax returns in question. FORM at 2. The Judge\u2019s finding that \nApplicant failed to provide his tax account transcripts is amply supported by the record, as is the \nresulting conclusion that none of the mitigating conditions applied. \nThe Judge also found that, despite Applicant\u2019s assertion that he makes payments on his \nfederal tax debt every month, \u201c[h]e did not . . . provide any documentation evidencing that payment \narrangement with the IRS or that he is in compliance with it.\u201d Decision at 5. Applicant also \nchallenges this finding. In support of his contention that he sent his IRS payment plan information, \nApplicant forwarded an email that appears to have been sent to a DOHA personnel security \nspecialist on May 13, 2024, in conjunction with Applicant\u2019s third interrogatory response. The \nemail attached a screenshot from the IRS website reflecting the existence of an Installment \nAgreement. Our review of the record confirms that the screenshot was not included in the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM. \nIn DOHA proceedings, it is the applicant\u2019s duty to present evidence sufficient to mitigate \nthe concerns established by the Government, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden of \npersuasion for obtaining a favorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. All applicants, \nincluding those that are pro se, are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their \nrights under the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). \nWhen Applicant received the Government\u2019s FORM, he was advised that, if he did not file \nany objections or submit any additional information, his case would be assigned to a judge for a \ndetermination \u201cbased solely upon the enclosed FORM.\u201d See FORM Transmittal Letter (emphasis \nadded). The FORM both listed on the first page and attached the six documentary exhibits \nunderlying the Government\u2019s argument against Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. Despite \nthe absence of the Installment Agreement screenshot from that listing and from the attached \nexhibits, Applicant failed to provide the document or any response at all to the FORM. If Applicant \nwanted the Judge to consider matters in his possession that were not contained in the FORM, it \nwas his obligation to provide that information. \nFinally, although the Board will sometimes remand a case for consideration of evidence \nthat was submitted but not received, such an action is not warranted here. The screenshot reflects \nthe existence of an Installment Agreement with $185 monthly payments due on the 28th of each \nmonth. The screenshot does not reflect, however, when the agreement was established and if it is \nstill active, the outstanding balance or tax years being addressed, if or for how long Applicant has \ncomplied with monthly payments, or if the agreement is even in Applicant\u2019s name.

Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the disqualifying and \nmitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrian A. Pristera, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 9, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign \nPreference), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On December 23, 2024, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant, 28 years old, was born in the United States in 1996 and became a naturalized \nPolish citizen in 2000 based on his parents\u2019 citizenship. In 2006, when he was ten years old, he \nrelocated to Poland with his family and has resided there since then. \nThe SOR alleged concerns related to Applicant\u2019s contacts to and interests within Poland \nincluding, under Guideline C, that he applied for and has maintained Polish residency since about \n2006, through which he is enabled and intends to vote in Polish elections and exercised that ability \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin the 2021 Polish presidential election. Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s \nparents are dual citizens of the United States and Poland, with his mother currently residing in the \nlatter, and that Applicant has various financial interests in Poland, including assets currently valued \nat approximately $11,000 and an anticipated inheritance valued at approximately $300,000. \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations with explanation and requested \nthat his case be decided based on the written record. He received a complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 3, 2024, and was notified of his \nability to respond with objections or additional information for the Judge to consider. Applicant \ndid not respond to the FORM and the Judge resolved the Guideline C concerns favorably but found \nagainst Applicant on the Guideline B concerns.1 \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge provided contradictory analyses for two of the \nSOR concerns and failed to properly consider and weigh the evidence regarding the remaining \nthree, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For the reasons set \nforth below, we affirm. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel first contends that the adverse formal findings for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nare directly contradicted by the Judge\u2019s narrative analyses and therefore represent either \ntypographical errors or an arbitrary and capricious result. In support of this contention as it pertains \nto Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), Counsel asserts that the Judge \u201cclearly \narticulated\u201d that the Government did not meet its burden to show that the relationship was \u201ca \nsecurity concern.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3 (emphasis added). Counsel\u2019s assertion, however, represents \nan incomplete and inaccurate summary of the Judge\u2019s analysis. \nThe Judge found three disqualifying conditions potentially applicable, but ultimately \nconcluded that one of those \u2013 AG \u00b6 7(a)2 \u2013 was not established. Tracking the language of that \ncondition and citing the \u201ccordiality between the U.S. and Poland, along with the Polish \nGovernment\u2019s democratic freedoms and norms,\u201d the Judge found that the Government had \u201cnot \nmet its burden to show that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d Decision at 5 (emphasis \nadded). Counsel\u2019s misrepresentation of what the Judge \u201cclearly articulated\u201d (i.e., insufficient \nevidence of a security concern) not only egregiously overstates the Judge\u2019s actual conclusion (i.e., \ninsufficient evidence of a heightened risk) as it relates to only one of the potential disqualifying \nconditions, but also ignores the Judge\u2019s analysis regarding the remaining two. \n1 Under Guideline E, the SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to register for the Selective Service as required by 50 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3802(a) and Presidential Proclamation No. 4771. The Judge concluded that the Government failed to establish \nthese concerns on the basis that the conduct is potentially disqualifying under Guideline J, which addresses criminal \nconduct but was not alleged, but is not disqualifying under Guideline E. \n2 AG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father (SOR \u00b6 1.b), Counsel similarly \ncontends that the Judge\u2019s failure to \u201caddress that relationship directly,\u201d after finding that the family \nrelationships in Poland did not meet the heightened risk standard, indicates that it \u201cobviously \nresolves in applicant\u2019s favor.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. Here again, Counsel\u2019s argument ignores entirely \nthe remainder of the Judge\u2019s Guideline B analysis. \nTo that end, the Judge concluded that AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and 7(f)3 were fully established by virtue \nof the potential conflicts of interest created by Applicant\u2019s \u201csignificant and longstanding \nconnections with Poland\u201d \u2013 which largely considered his relationship with his Polish parents and \nresidence there for the past 18 years, including by choice as an adult and despite his U.S. \ncitizenship \u2013 and his \u201csignificant Polish property interests, especially in relation to his lack of U.S. \nproperty interests.\u201d Decision at 5. The Judge went on to find that none of the mitigating conditions \nfully applied, and concluded that \u201cApplicant\u2019s longstanding ties to Poland, as well as his \nacknowledged divided allegiance between Poland and the United States, [left] questions and \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Id. at 9. The Judge\u2019s \nGuideline B analysis reflects a rational connection between the findings and conclusion, which is \nsustainable. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments simply advocate for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions \nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at \n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). For example, Applicant charges that the Judge failed to \u201cplace any \nweight on the commonsense mitigation related to\u201d his $1,000 bank account (SOR \u00b6 1.c), arguing \nthat it is \u201ca nominal amount, indicative of a bank account used in the normal course of life.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 4. He also argues that the Judge failed to \u201cproperly consider the commonsense needs\u201d of \nowning forms of transportation in Poland, including the car and motorcycle valued at \napproximately $10,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Id. at 5. \nIt bears noting that, even without considering the anticipated inheritance, the foregoing \n\u201cnominal\u201d foreign financial interests still represent more value than what Applicant maintains in \nthe United States \u2013 nothing. A comparative valuation between an applicant\u2019s financial interests in \nthe U.S. and abroad is a relevant and required consideration in assessing the significance of the \nforeign interests. See ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2003). \nContinuing with that assessment, Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse finding \nregarding the inheritance interest in his father\u2019s $300,000 home (SOR \u00b6 1.e), arguing that it ignored \nand improperly weighed that the interest \u201cis not definite, and is only in anticipated interest.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 5. While prospective, Applicant\u2019s inheritance rights represent a significant foreign \nfinancial interest which, moreover, he intends to keep. FORM Item 2 at 3. It was not error for the \nJudge to consider this inheritance interest in assessing Applicant\u2019s foreign financial interests as a \nwhole. \n3 AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or technology; 7(f): substantial \nbusiness, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business \nthat could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter considering the record, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s longstanding ties to Poland, his comparatively significant financial interests therein, \nand his acknowledged divided allegiance between Poland and the United States raise unmitigated \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nAndrea M. Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 24, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective \nJune 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On February 24, \n2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola granted \nApplicant national security eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant maintains certain ties within Hong Kong, including that \nhis mother and father are resident citizens1 and that his grandparents gifted him real estate in Hong \nKong worth approximately $350,000. Applicant admitted both allegations with explanation. \n1 Based on Applicant\u2019s disclosures in his security clearance application and interrogatory response, the SOR alleged, \nand he admitted, that his parents are citizens of Hong Kong. See Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 29, 30; SOR Response \nat 1.

He immigrated to the United States \nin 2012 and became a citizen several years later. He is unmarried and has no children. Applicant \nserved in the U.S. Reserve force for eight years and has been employed by a defense contractor \nsince May 2023. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father, both in their early 60s, remain residents of Hong Kong and \nare registered as British Nationals (Overseas) (BN(O)), meaning that they may obtain British \ncitizenship by registration if they ever decide to reside in the United Kingdom. Applicant\u2019s mother \nis a nurse, his father an entrepreneur, and neither is connected to either the Hong Kong or British \ngovernments. \nApplicant has an ownership interest in his grandparents\u2019 residence in Hong Kong, valued \nat approximately $350,000. He plans to sell the property and invest the proceeds in U.S. real estate. \nApplicant\u2019s annual income is about $100,000 and he has about $80,000 in U.S.-based assets. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s ties to Hong Kong were sufficient to raise three \ndisqualifying conditions. For reasons set forth more fully below, he went on to find the concerns \nmitigated and, noting that \u201cApplicant is well respected by those who served with him in the U.S. \n[military] and in the defense industry,\u201d concluded that the record left him without questions or \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. Decision at 6. \nScope of Review \nOn appeal, the Board does not review a case de novo, but rather addresses material issues \nraised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. When a judge\u2019s factual \nfindings are challenged, the Board must determine whether the \u201cfindings of fact are supported by \nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in \nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nWhen a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary \nor capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nhave its own citizenship or independent nationality law. Rather, pursuant to the Nationality Law of the PRC, Hong \nKong residents of Chinese descent born in the Chinese Territories (including Hong Kong) are Chinese nationals, \nregardless of their status as British Nationals (Overseas). See Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC, Annex \nIII (July 1, 1997); Standing Committee of the Eighth National People\u2019s Congress, 19th Sess., Explanations of Some \nQuestions Concerning the Implementation of the Nationality Law of the PRC in the Hong Kong SAR (May 15, 1996). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless?; (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds?; and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge failed to consider its post-hearing \nevidence, and that his application of the Guideline B mitigating conditions and analysis under the \nWhole-Person Concept were arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record evidence. \nGovernment\u2019s Post-Hearing Evidence \nThe record reflects that, after the hearing, the Government submitted additional materials \nvia e-mail on December 15, 2024, and that the Judge acknowledged their receipt the following \nday. See E-mail dated Dec. 16, 2024. The submission included an Appeal Board decision \naddressing an applicant\u2019s heavy burden of persuasion for mitigation when relatives are in a hostile \ncountry and holding that Hong Kong\u2019s status as an SAR of the PRC is an important aspect to \nconsider when an applicant has relatives there. The submission also included a complete copy of \nthe State Department\u2019s Hong Kong 2023 Human Rights Report, an excerpt of which was \npreviously included in Hearing Exhibit II. The Government persuasively argues that the Judge \nfailed to consider this post-hearing evidence. \nIn his recitation of each party\u2019s pre- and post-hearing evidence, the Judge identified for the \nGovernment only the four exhibits offered at hearing.2 Unlike Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmission, the Judge did not assign the Government\u2019s post-hearing submission an exhibit \nmarking, nor did he reference it elsewhere in his decision. It appears, therefore, that the Judge \nfailed to consider the evidence, which may have impacted the outcome of the case and therefore \nconstitutes harmful error. As addressed below, however, reversal is the clear outcome in this matter \nand therefore remand for consideration of the omitted evidence is unnecessary. \nApplicant\u2019s Parents in Hong Kong \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents creates both a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation or coercion and a potential conflict of interest.3 He went on to find that \n2 GEs 1 and 2 and Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II. \n3 AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe parents are BN(O)s, free to depart Hong Kong for the UK, and have no connection to the PRC \nGovernment. With no corresponding analysis of the mitigative impact of those findings, the Judge \nconcluded that the concern was mitigated through application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c). \nThe Government argues that the foregoing conclusion is unsustainable because it: 1) fails \nto acknowledge Applicant\u2019s heavy burden of persuasion as to mitigation of his relatives in Hong \nKong; 2) fails to address Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his parents or the resulting \nvulnerability to the Hong Kong and PRC governments; and 3) \u201cis based upon the irrelevant and \nerroneous finding that Applicant\u2019s parents are free to depart Hong Kong.\u201d Appeal Brief at 14. To \nproperly address the Government\u2019s argument \u2013 which has merit \u2013 and the Judge\u2019s assessment of \nthe security significance of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents and Hong Kong, we note the \nfollowing pertinent information drawn from the record. \nApplicant lived in Hong Kong for 18 years before immigrating to the U.S. in 2012. He was \nnaturalized in about 2016 and identifies himself as a dual citizen of the U.S. and Hong Kong. \nDuring his interview, Applicant disclosed that he \u201cwould not be willing to relinquish his [Hong \nKong] citizenship if it was requested of him, but he would relinquish it if it were required.\u201d GE 2 \nat 11. During Applicant\u2019s eight years of service in the Reserve force, which began in 2015, he did \nnot hold a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in China and reside in Hong Kong. There is no evidence that \neither has lived outside of China or Hong Kong. In addition to having no connection to the Hong \nKong government, neither has connection to the PRC government.

Since 2019, the \nPRC has repeatedly taken actions inconsistent with the Basic Law \nof HK of PRC. \nThe PRC seeks to become a world science and technology \nsuperpower and use this technological superiority for economic, \npolitical, and military gain. The PRC remains the most active and \npersistent cyber threat to U.S. Government networks.

The decision is otherwise silent to the security significance of the PRC conditions \nor how they relate to the Hong Kong SAR. \nIn Guideline B cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, including its \nintelligence gathering history and human rights record, are among the important considerations for \nthe judge, including as part of the whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. \nBd. Apr. 6, 2007). Crucial to this analysis is an accurate and current assessment of the geopolitical \nsituation in the country. See ISCR Case No. 07-14508 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2008). To that end, \nwe note the following information drawn from the record regarding Hong Kong and the PRC. \nHong Kong is an SAR of the PRC, and the PRC is responsible for its foreign relations and \ndefense. Despite being obligated to afford Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy \u2013 in all matters \nexcept foreign and defense affairs \u2013 the PRC has repeatedly taken actions since 2019 that are \ninconsistent with that obligation and with Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law.5 \nOn June 30, 2020, the PRC passed the National Security Law (NSL), which overrides the \nBasic Law where discrepancies exist. The NSL prohibits a broad range of vaguely defined acts of \nseparatism, subversion, terrorism, and \u201ccollusion with foreign or overseas forces\u201d perceived to \nthreaten China\u2019s national security, and it imposes severe penalties for offenses, which are applied \nto both Hong Kong residents and foreign citizens, regardless of physical presence in Hong Kong.6 \n5 HE I at 2-3 (citing U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, U.S. Relations With Hong Kong, November 9, 2023). \n6 Id. at 3-4 (citing U.S.-China Economic & Security Review Commission, 2023 Report to Congress, November 2023). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe 2024 Safeguarding National Security Ordinance identified additional vaguely defined \noffenses, such as treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage against public infrastructure, \nand external interference, which are applicable to foreign nationals within Hong Kong and to \nindividuals, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents, located outside its borders. \nAuthorities attempt to enforce these provisions against individuals, including U.S. citizens and \npermanent residents, residing outside of their jurisdiction by offering cash rewards for information \nleading to their arrests in Hong Kong.7 \nThe PRC is an authoritarian state with significant human rights issues.8 It remains the most \nactive and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure \nnetworks. Beijing\u2019s cyber espionage pursuits and its industry\u2019s export of surveillance, information, \nand communications technologies increase the threats of aggressive cyber operations against the \nU.S. and the suppression of the free flow of information in cyberspace. The PRC will continue to \nexpand its global intelligence posture to advance the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ambitions, \nchallenge U.S. national security and global influence, quell perceived regime threats worldwide, \nand steal trade secrets and IP to bolster China\u2019s indigenous science and technology sectors.9 \nThe foregoing facts reflect that, in cases currently involving Hong Kong, an assessment of \nthe geopolitical circumstances necessarily includes consideration of the PRC.10 Accordingly, we \nare persuaded that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the PRC and, as a result, Hong Kong, underestimated \nthe geopolitical threat posed to the U.S. and impaired his analysis of the security significance of \nApplicant\u2019s parents. \nWe have long recognized that there is a rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family \nties in a hostile country,11 even if that family has no connection with the foreign government, and \nthe risk that the applicant might fail to safeguard classified information.

Instead, the Judge focused \nprimarily on the parents\u2019 status as BN(O)s, noting that they \u201care free to depart Hong Kong for the \nUnited Kingdom.\u201d Decision at 5. The Judge\u2019s emphasis on the BNO status is misplaced, especially \nconsidering the parents\u2019 residency in Hong Kong, and particularly problematic when compared to \nhis failure to identify, let alone discuss, the parents\u2019 citizenship \u2013 a concern explicitly alleged in \none of two SOR concerns. \nBN(O) status is a distinct form of British nationality, not British citizenship, and there is \nno evidence that the parents have any other personal, professional, or monetary connection to the \nUK. Additionally, AG \u00b6 8(a) affords mitigation upon consideration of the country in which the \nforeign family members are located \u2013 i.e., Hong Kong SAR of the PRC. That they may, at some \npurely hypothetical future point, leave Hong Kong for the UK is irrelevant to the condition\u2019s \napplication. Moreover, even if a future relocation was relevant, there is simply no evidence that \nApplicant\u2019s parents would relocate to the UK, even if faced with a threat from within Hong Kong \nor the PRC. The Judge\u2019s assessment that they are free to depart Hong Kong for the UK is \nspeculative at best, and arguably runs contrary to the evidence, which reflects that the PRC and \nSAR refuse to recognize the BN(O) passport as an identity or travel document.12 \nThe nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents is reflected in his regular \ncommunication with them and his extended, even if only occasional, in-person visits. The Judge \nfailed to sufficiently recognize the current relevant geopolitical situation of Hong Kong, or to \nrecognize at all Applicant\u2019s heavy burden to demonstrate that his parents are not a means of \ncoercion or exploitation. Application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) is unsupported by the record. \nAG \u00b6 8(c)13 \nThe Government next challenges application of AG \u00b6 8(c), arguing that the Judge\u2019s scant \nexplanation for applying the condition \u201cfail[ed] to address the extent of Applicant\u2019s \ncommunications with his family members.\u201d Appeal Brief at 19. AG \u00b6 8(c) is a conjunctive \ncondition that contemplates contact so infrequent and casual that it is unlikely to create a risk of \nforeign influence or exploitation. Both elements are necessary, and they are not simply, or even \nnecessarily correlated. See ISCR Case No. 02-09907 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his parents includes communication several times each month, as \nwell as occasional in-person contact with them when he visited them in Hong Kong and when his \nfather visited the U.S. In applying AG \u00b6 8(c), the Judge failed to articulate how Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with his parents are either \u201ccasual\u201d or \u201cinfrequent,\u201d let alone both. Even if the Judge could \nsustainably find that Applicant\u2019s visits and communications with his parents were \u201cinfrequent,\u201d \n12 U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Hong Kong, p. 30.

Post-Hearing Exhibit (PHE) R; PHE S at 3; PHE T at 3. There is no evidence that either parent renewed \ntheir BN(O) passport after their expiration in 2006. Rather, Applicant\u2019s reliance on their 1996-issued passports \nsuggests the opposite. \n13 AG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with immediate family members are not casual. See \nISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). Given the evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with his parents in Hong Kong, the Judge\u2019s perfunctory conclusion that those contacts \nwere infrequent and casual in nature is arbitrary and capricious. We find no rational basis for the \nJudge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 8(c). \nIn summary and contrary to the Judge\u2019s analysis, it is foreseeable that Applicant\u2019s family \ncould be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those in the PRC who are \ndevoted to acquiring U.S.-protected information, especially considering his relationship and \nregular contact with his parents. The Judge\u2019s favorable finding on this concern is unsustainable. \nApplicant\u2019s Real Estate in Hong Kong \nThroughout his decision, the Judge characterized the Hong Kong property as Applicant\u2019s \nfuture interest. His findings of fact included that, \u201cUpon her death, Applicant\u2019s 89-year-old \ngrandmother . . . has gifted Applicant her Hong Kong residence\u201d and that he plans to sell the \nproperty \u201c[o]nce [he] obtains ownership.\u201d Decision at 2 (emphasis added). The Judge identified \nthat, \u201cin the future, Applicant will inherit a property worth about $350,000\u201d as the basis for \ndisqualification pursuant to AG \u00b6 7(f).14 Id. at 5 (emphasis added). Finally, in finding the concern \nmitigated through AG \u00b6 8(f),15 the Judge assessed that, \u201cAs to Applicant\u2019s potential, future \ninheritance, this U.S. [military] Veteran plans to sell the property once he gains possession, and \nreinvest in the U.S.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). The Government argues that the Judge\u2019s repeated \ncharacterization of the Hong Kong property as a future interest constitutes both factual error and a \nreliant erroneous analysis. We agree. \nAs to the factual error, the record is unequivocal that Applicant\u2019s interest in the property is \nneither future nor hypothetical, but that it has been current and active since at least June 2024.16 \nThe Judge\u2019s finding otherwise is contrary to the record evidence, and the erroneous finding \nresulted in harmful error when it was relied upon in weighing the respective values of Applicant\u2019s \nassets in the U.S. and Hong Kong. \nIn assessing the significance of the foreign financial interest, a judge must consider its \nvalue in comparison to the applicant\u2019s financial interests in the U.S., as well as any other evidence \n14 AG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign owned or \nforeign-operated business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n15 AG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are \nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n16 In his June 2024 response to Government interrogatories, Applicant disclosed that he was the sole owner of the \nproperty, which he received as a gift from his grandparents and valued at approximately $350,000. GE 2 at 7, 16.

Decision at 5. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion, Applicant\u2019s U.S.-based financial \ninterests, which include his annual salary of about $100,000 and about $80,000 in bank and \nretirement assets,18 represent a fraction of his foreign financial interest, which primarily includes \nthe $350,000 property, as well as a modest bank account held jointly with his father. \nLooking beyond the property value, Applicant\u2019s real estate in Hong Kong arguably reveals \nmore about the closeness of his family ties than his financial interest in the region. Putting aside \nhis future intent when the property is no longer inhabited, Applicant\u2019s grandparents gifted him \ndirectly this substantial financial asset and he maintains it as-is for the benefit of his grandmother. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s foreign financial ties in conjunction with his foreign family ties and the \nrecord as a whole, it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had \nproduced sufficient evidence to warrant application of AG \u00b6 8(f), or to conclude that Applicant \nhad mitigated the financial interest security concern. \nConclusion \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and character are not an issue in this case. Rather, his circumstances \ncreate the security concerns because commonsense suggests that even those whose character is \nunimpeachable could be faced with situations that would seriously tempt them to place the safety \nof loved ones ahead of other competing interests. \nThat said, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). The standard applicable in national security decisions is that eligibility may be granted \nonly when \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 528. \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe Government has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating reversible error below. \nBased on the record before us, the Judge\u2019s decision in this matter was arbitrary and capricious in \nthat it failed to examine relevant evidence and consider relevant factors and important aspects of \nthe case, failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, and it offers an \nexplanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence. It is not sustainable under \nthe Egan standard and must be reversed. See ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd.

The Judge found adversely to the $62,000 federal tax balance, noting that \nApplicant had made no payments towards resolving the debt and only recently filed an appeal to \nhave the debt reconsidered, with no resolution as of the close of the record. Citing that Applicant\u2019s \ndebts were ignored for many years, the Judge concluded that \u201chis history of financial \nirresponsibility and inaction for so long casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d Decision at 8. \nThe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo and our authority to review a case is \nlimited to matters in which the appealing party has raised a claim of harmful error.

Moreover, although Appendix C provides authority to grant \nconditional security eligibility,1 our review of the record below reflects no evidence of proposed \nadditional security measures or the efficacy thereof. Accordingly, Applicant has not established \nthat the granting of an exception under Appendix C is merited. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

Finding that \u201cApplicant provided no \ndocumentation of any payments made . . . on his three referenced accounts,\u201d the Judge concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s \u201c[h]andwritten payment claims without proper documentation represent no more \nthan promises to resolve his still outstanding debts and are not viable substitutes for a track record \nof paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a responsible way.\u201d Decision at 3, 6. \nThe Board has long held that, until an applicant has a \u201cmeaningful financial track record,\u201d \nit cannot be said \u201cthat he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 2 (App. Bd.

The Judge found favorably for Applicant on the Guideline J and Guideline E \nallegations, with the caveat that the conduct alleged under Guideline J and the behavior underlying \nthe termination alleged at SOR \u00b6 3.b were relevant for consideration in his Guideline I analysis. \nThe Judge found adversely to Applicant on all Guideline I allegations. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-forties and single, with two sons. A high-school graduate with about \n35 college credits, Applicant has 20 years of experience in the security field and currently works \nas an armed security officer. \nIn June 2020, Applicant\u2019s mother filed a petition for an emergency mental health evaluation \nof her son, citing to behavior that included delusions, false beliefs, aggressive talking, mood swings, \nunwarranted suspicion, irrational thoughts, and his belief that he had special powers. SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe petition was unsuccessful, but Applicant was hospitalized shortly thereafter for treatment of \ndepression, which he attributed to being unable to see his younger son. At hearing, Applicant \ndisagreed with his mother\u2019s description of his behavior. \nIn August 2021, Applicant\u2019s mother again petitioned for an emergency mental health \nevaluation, citing Applicant\u2019s delusional and paranoid behavior, which included giving his \nautomobile to a stranger. SOR \u00b6 1.b. At hearing, Applicant explained that he was unemployed, \ndrinking alcohol and smoking marijuana during this timeframe, that he had turned his life to Christ, \nand that he consequently considered matters such as a vehicle to be superficial. Although he gave \nconflicting testimony regarding whether his car was stolen or given away, Applicant confirmed \nthat he told people at a bus stop that they could take the car if they needed it. Applicant also gave \naway his television, a laptop, and a mattress by leaving the items on his front porch. \nUpon his subsequent involuntary mental health evaluation, medical personnel made the \nfollowing entry in Applicant\u2019s treatment record: \n[Patient] was brought in by a court order petition by mom due to pt manic and bizarre \nbehavior. Pt is extremely delusional, irritable, paranoid and loud in the ER. Pt bursts \nout crying because what the police and ER doctors and nurses [are] doing to him is \ndemonic. Pt said the whole world is demonic. Pt per court order has a [history] of \nbipolar and depression. . . . Pt appears to be responding to internal stimuli (talking \nand answering himself at times). Pt said by the way he is \u201callergic to sinners and \nuncompassionate people like us.\u201d . . . Pt is noncompliant with med. Pt said he \ntakes no meds because the bible said herbs is all we need. . . . Pt is confuse[d], his \nspeech is disorganized and nonsensical. \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 5 at 9. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was assessed as \u201cpsychotic\u201d during this mental health evaluation.

GE 1 at 26, 27. \nIn February 2024, Applicant was referred to Dr. G, a licensed psychologist, for a mental \nhealth evaluation as part of his security clearance adjudication. Dr. G based her opinion on her \nreview of the background information, a clinical interview and observations, and an objective \npersonality assessment. Dr. G noted the following: that Applicant was not open or insightful \nregarding his mental health symptoms, diagnoses or treatment history; that he was not endorsing \ncurrent symptoms but was not considered a reliable informant; that his medical records from 2021 \nindicated an earlier diagnosis of bipolar disorder and a diagnosis of schizophrenia upon discharge; \nthat Applicant disagreed with both diagnoses; that he had never been compliant with medication \nor psychiatric recommendations; and that he was \u201cobserved to be talking to himself during both \nbreaks taken during the evaluation, which could either be due to anxiety or more concerningly, \npossibly responding to internal stimuli.\u201d GE 6 at 6\u20137. In light of these factors, Dr. G rendered an \nopinion that Applicant\u2019s \u201cjudgement, reliability, and trustworthiness are not reasonably intact\u201d and \nthat \u201cthere is an indication that his current psychological condition impairs his judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or his ability to safeguard classified or sensitive information.\u201d Id. at 7. Applicant \nhas not received any mental health treatment since Dr. G\u2019s evaluation and is not taking any \nprescribed mental-health medications. \nThe Judge found the following incident \u2013 alleged under Guideline J as criminal conduct \u2013 \nto be relevant for Guideline I purposes. In July 2020, about the time of his mother\u2019s first and \nunsuccessful petition for a mental health evaluation, a neighbor filed a petition for a peace order \nagainst Applicant for entering the neighbor\u2019s property, breaking a yard statue, pushing over a \nmotorcycle on the property, and returning later and hitting the front door with a large cement tile, \nbreaking the door. Applicant explained that he was depressed because he was unable to see his son \nduring the COVID\u201319 pandemic, that he decided to mow the yard of his neighbor, whom he did \nnot know, that he accidentally knocked over a yard statute and motorcycle with his mower, and \nthat he knocked on the front door to explain and accidentally broke the door. Applicant testified \nthat he went home, drank some alcohol, and smoked marijuana. He said he was upset and threw a \nrock at the door because the neighbor was sitting on the porch earlier in the day and had \u201ca bad \nlook on his face.\u201d Transcript at 44. \nSimilarly, the Judge found one incident of termination \u2013 alleged as SOR \u00b6 3.b under \nGuideline E \u2013 to be relevant in the context of the Guideline I allegations. Around March 2017, \nApplicant\u2019s employer terminated his employment because of multiple instances of aggressive and \nintimidating comments and gestures to government employees and others. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Judge found that the record evidence established all four enumerated security concerns \nunder Guideline I.1 Turning to the mitigating conditions, the Judge concluded that none applied: \nApplicant is not currently receiving mental-health treatment. There is no \nfavorable prognosis. There is no statement from a mental-health professional \nindicating an absence of a current problem or that his mental-health issues are in \nremission. Applicant has not accepted that he has a mental-health issue. Based on \nall the facts and circumstances, especially Dr. G\u2019s report, the mental-health \ntreatment records, and his behavior with his neighbor, the mental, psychological \nconditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nDecision at 11. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s primary argument is that he was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder \nand schizophrenia. He asserts that \u201cany erratic behavior\u201d on his behalf was due to a combination \nof being unemployed, an inability to see his son, and his use of alcohol and marijuana: \u201cThese are \nthe things which caused my erratic behavior at that time and not being Bi-Polar or Schizophrenic.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1. Applicant highlights that he \u201cno longer partake[s] in those vices\u201d and that he \nhas been employed at his current company for over three years and has exhibited no symptoms of \neither disorder. Id. \nOur review of the record confirms that there is substantial evidence to support the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that all four disqualifying conditions under Guideline I were established. Additionally, \nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that no mitigating condition has been established is well-supported by the \nevidence. As the Judge highlights, Applicant denies that he has either bipolar disorder or \nschizophrenia, but he submitted no statement from a mental health professional to rebut the \ndiagnoses of record or to corroborate his claim that he currently exhibits no symptoms. Given the \ngravity of Applicant\u2019s conduct, as reflected in employment records, petitions to the court, medical \nrecords, and diagnoses, Applicant\u2019s own report that he is experiencing no symptoms is insufficient \nto establish AG \u00b6 29(d) \u2013 that his condition was temporary, the situation has been resolved, and he \nno longer shows indications of emotional instability. The Judge\u2019s analysis reflects that he weighed \nthe record evidence and reached a reasonable conclusion, and Applicant\u2019s disagreement with that \nweighing is insufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 28: (a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not \ncovered under any other guideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors; (b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has \na condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness; (c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient \nhospitalization; and (d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric \ncondition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to \ntake prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

The Judge found favorably regarding the auto \nloan and the 2018 tax return filing, but adversely on the federal and state tax balances. \nOn appeal, Applicant requests reconsideration of the decision based on three purported \nerrors in the Judge\u2019s findings. First, he contends that his auto loan balance is less than what was \nalleged in the SOR and will soon be paid off; however, the Judge resolved this debt in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor, and it did not contribute to his overall unfavorable decision. Applicant next challenges the \nJudge\u2019s finding that the state tax balance remains outstanding and reiterates that the debt was \nresolved in 2023. In finding adversely on this debt, the Judge recognized Applicant\u2019s explanation \nthat the debt was resolved in 2023 but highlighted the absence of any documentation to corroborate \nthe resolution. Despite acknowledging at hearing the importance of documentary support, \nApplicant provided none in his post-hearing submission. Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s finding that the \nstate tax balance remains outstanding was reasonable based on the evidence before him. \nFinally, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that the federal tax balance remains \noutstanding for approximately $10,400, citing his IRS installment agreement and corresponding \nmonthly payments. Here again, the Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s most recent IRS installment \nagreement of November 2024, the four payments made thereunder between December 2024 and \nApril 2025, and Applicant\u2019s promise to continue making monthly payments as required going \nforward. The Judge also noted that Applicant has previously entered into installment agreements \nwith the IRS, including in July 2019 and again in November 2023, the latter of which was paid \ninconsistently and without completion. Additionally, \u201chis federal income tax debt increased more \nthan $2,000 from November 2023 to November 2024\u201d because Applicant was \u201cnot withholding \nenough from his pay or making quarterly tax payments to gradually cause his federal income tax \ndebt to decrease.\u201d Decision at 15. Noting that Applicant has carried a federal tax debt since 2018, \nthe Judge concluded that the record failed to show a meaningful track record of reducing that debt. \nIndeed, it is well established that until an applicant has a \u201cmeaningful financial track record,\u201d it \ncannot be said \u201cthat he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2003). Here, the Judge\u2019s adverse \nfinding regarding Applicant\u2019s federal tax balance, even in the face of a current IRS installment \nagreement, is reasonable and supported by the record and Appeal Board precedent. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Rather, the Judge examined and weighed the disqualifying and mitigating \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \n1 Under Guideline B, the SOR also alleged that Applicant maintained certain financial and personal connections to \nSomalia, all of which the Judge resolved favorably and are not at issue on appeal. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-00854 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 17, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis \nof that decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nMarch 31, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley \ndenied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nbetween August 2017 and July 2021, including while granted access to classified information. He \nalso used psychedelic mushrooms in April 2019 and cocaine in August 2022, while granted access \nto classified information. These allegations were cross alleged under Guideline J.

The Judge found against Applicant on the Guideline E \nallegations. The Judge found for Applicant on the Guideline H and Guideline J allegations, and \nthose favorable findings are not in issue on appeal as the Government did not cross-appeal. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-20s. He has never married and has no children. He earned two \nbachelor\u2019s degrees in May 2020. Since June 2020, Applicant has been employed by his current \nemployer, a government contractor, in various capacities. He was hired as a summer intern for a \ndifferent government contractor in 2017. He subsequently worked for the same contractor in the \nsummers of 2018 and 2019. He first obtained a security clearance in 2018 for his summer \ninternship. He had access to classified information during the summer of 2018, the summer of \n2019, and after starting to work for his current employer. \nBetween August 2017 and July 2021, Applicant used marijuana experimentally four times \nat parties or social gatherings while in college. He also tried psychedelic mushrooms once in April \n2019 and cocaine once in August 2022. His cocaine use was while employed by his current \nemployer. He obtained the marijuana, psychedelic mushrooms, and cocaine from friends for free. \nAll drug usage occurred while under the influence of alcohol. \nApplicant completed an SCA in March 2018 for his summer internship while in \nundergraduate school. On it, he intentionally failed to disclose his experimental use of marijuana \nin 2017 and 2018. In a second SCA completed in January 2023, he again intentionally failed to \ndisclose his past use of illegal drugs \u2014 in this case, his experimental use of marijuana, psychedelic \nmushrooms, and cocaine. \nFollowing his completion of his 2023 SCA, Applicant disclosed his past drug use to his \nformer design lead and supervisor. In March 2023, three months after completing his second SCA, \nApplicant was asked to meet an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to \nreview the information in his 2023 SCA. When the OPM investigator asked about his past drug \nuse, Applicant provided full and accurate accounts of his drug use history without any evidence of \nconfrontation. He did so out of feelings of guilt over his previous omissions of his past drug use. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChallenges to Factual Findings \nThe Judge made several incorrect or contradictory findings when discussing Applicant\u2019s \nbackground and in his analysis of the case. For instance, the finding that Applicant has \u201cnever \nmarried and has no children\u201d is accurate, despite the Judge\u2019s finding in the next paragraph of his \ndecision that incorrectly states \u201cApplicant married in May 2022 and has one stepchild (age 10) \nfrom this marriage.\u201d Decision at 3. This error appears to be typographical and, on its own, was not \nlikely harmful. See ISCR Case No. 99-0500 at 2 (App. Bd. May 19, 2000). This, however, is not \nthe end of the factual errors. \nOf particular relevance is the Judge\u2019s mathematical error in calculating the timeframe \nbetween Applicant\u2019s first SCA and his admissions of drug use to the OPM investigator. Applicant \nclaims that, throughout the Decision, the Judge misstates this timeframe as an eight-year gap when \nit was only five years. As Applicant\u2019s first SCA was completed in March 2018, and he disclosed \nhis falsification in March 2023, Applicant\u2019s math is correct. There was a five-year gap between \nthe first omission and the disclosure. This error permeated the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline E. \nThe Judge first found as troubling \u201cthe eight-year time lapse\u201d between Applicant\u2019s 2018 SCA and \n2023 interview disclosure. Id. at 10. Next, the Judge found, \u201cEven with a more expansive \nconstruction of the \u2018prompt\u2019 prong of [AG] \u00b6 17(a) by the Appeal Board, Applicant\u2019s cumulative \ndelays of over eight years (i.e., January 2018 through March 2023) to make [the] right decision to \nvoluntarily disclose his past use of illegal drugs came way too late to satisfy the Appeal Board\u2019s \nreasonable time interpretations of the prompt prong of [AG] \u00b6 17(a).\u201d Id. at 11. The Judge \nincorrectly noted the start date of the relevant timeframe as January 2018 and, despite accurately \nidentifying the relevant years, he again asserted the confession occurred over eight years later. \nElsewhere in his analysis, he dropped the reference to the dates and indicated that \u201cChallenging is \nthe reconciling of this eight-year gap with an even stretched meaning of the prompt prong in [AG] \n\u00b6 17(a).\u201d Id. at 10. \nSimilarly, the Judge found that, \u201cWith over five years of unbroken employment with his \ncurrent employer he had plenty of opportunities to correct his omissions of marijuana use in his \n2018 [SCA] but declined to do so out of concern for his security clearance.\u201d Id. at 10. Applicant \nhas been employed by his current employer since June 2020. The Judge\u2019s finding calculates the \ntimeframe through his March 2025 decision, but Applicant disclosed his falsification in March \n2023, at which point he had less than three years of unbroken employment with his current \nemployer. \nThe Judge also opined that it was \u201cunclear\u201d if the possibility of a future polygraph \ninfluenced Applicant\u2019s decision to disclose his drug use in 2023. Id. at 5. The record, however, \ndoes not support a finding of uncertainty as Applicant testified at hearing that he had no awareness \nof any future polygraph or even the possibility of one, and therefore the possibility of a polygraph \nplayed no part in his decision to disclose his drug use history. Tr. at 53-54. Because the voluntary \nnature of a corrective disclosure is undercut when the disclosure is prompted by the threat of the \ninformation being discovered by some other means, 1 we cannot conclude that the Judge\u2019s finding \nin this regard was harmless or that it \u2013 or the foregoing timeframe errors \u2013 did not impact his \nanalysis under AG \u00b6 17(a). \n1 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-03502 at 3 (App. Bd.

Directive \u00b6 6.3. Public confidence in the industrial security \nprogram relies in part on the appearance of a fair and impartial adjudication in light of the record \nas a whole. In a case where the Judge makes multiple findings about an applicant that have no \nfoundation in the record, the Judge\u2019s decision is undermined and so is confidence in the industrial \nsecurity program. ISCR Case No. 11-01393 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2012). Taken together, the \nerrors identified above undercut the presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence. \nGuideline E and Whole-Person Concept \nOn appeal, Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s failure to apply mitigating conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 17(a)2 and 17(e)3, and to consider the record evidence in light of the Whole-Person Concept. \nThe Judge\u2019s analysis of potential mitigation under Guideline E was flawed, based upon his reliance \non the factual errors addressed above.4 Additionally, we note that Applicant was a college student \nwhen he completed his first SCA and only worked for a government contractor as an intern for a \nfew months in the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019.

    "summary": "analysis of conduct risks misunderstanding or overstating its security significance, which also offends the Whole-Person Concept. The instant case reflects a similar fact pattern seen in a narrow, but noteworthy string of cases recently before the Board, where an applicant has previously used other illegal drugs and has also used recreational marijuana, either more regularly, more recently, or both. The common thread in these decisions is that the marijuana use has been relied upon to effectively renew the concern stemming from the other drug use (otherwise likely mitigated by the passage of time or limited use) to find a continuing course of conduct that results in across-the-board adverse findings. When, as discussed below, the recreational marijuana use deserves less, or even no negative inference on judgment, the ensuing analysis is flawed. To that end, a commonsense understanding of the evolving landscape of marijuana law and policy3 in the United States informs us that simple recreational marijuana use no longer holds the same severe negative implications as many other illegal drugs. This is especially, but not exclusively, true when the use occurs permissibly under state law. The Whole-Person Concept, which identifies \u201cnature, extent, and seriousness\u201d among the factors to consider in assessing the relevance of conduct, therefore plays an especially important role in cases alleging prior recreational marijuana use. 4 Recognizing that evolving landscape, the resulting in",

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 12, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. \n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On January 17, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his late 20s. He earned a high school diploma in June 2016 and attended \ncollege classes in 2017. Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor since September \n2023. He has never held a security clearance. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his initial security clearance investigation, which began with submission of his \nsecurity clearance application in September 2023, Applicant disclosed information regarding his \ndrug use history, including that he used marijuana recreationally with varying frequency from 2016 \nto July 2023 and purchased marijuana during that period, and used psilocybin mushrooms and \nlysergic acid diethylamide between December 2018 and January 2020, cocaine between November \n2020 and January 2021, and unprescribed Adderall in May and June 2018. Under Guideline H, the \nSOR alleged concerns based on the foregoing history, all of which Applicant admitted with further \nexplanation. The Judge found against Applicant on all concerns. \nScope of Review \nOn appeal, the Board does not review a case de novo. Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. When a \njudge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or \ncapricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; \nit does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an \nimportant aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the \nrecord evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless? (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds?; and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to properly apply the Guideline H \nmitigating conditions and the Whole-Person Concept. For the following reasons, we remand the \nJudge\u2019s decision. \nWhole-Person Concept \nConduct alleged under the Adjudicative Guidelines must be evaluated in the context of the \nWhole-Person Concept, which requires judges to consider numerous variables across a large swath \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof an applicant\u2019s life in reaching a national security eligibility determination.1 At the risk of \noffending this concept, the Board has cautioned judges against conducting piecemeal analyses or \nassessing individual allegations in isolation. See ISCR Case No. 02-11489 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, \n2003). The Whole-Person Concept does not, however, bar a judge from also assessing the security \nsignificance of individual aspects of alleged conduct independent from each other.2 To the \ncontrary, a mere collective analysis of conduct risks misunderstanding or overstating its security \nsignificance, which also offends the Whole-Person Concept. \nThe instant case reflects a similar fact pattern seen in a narrow, but noteworthy string of \ncases recently before the Board, where an applicant has previously used other illegal drugs and has \nalso used recreational marijuana, either more regularly, more recently, or both. The common thread \nin these decisions is that the marijuana use has been relied upon to effectively renew the concern \nstemming from the other drug use (otherwise likely mitigated by the passage of time or limited \nuse) to find a continuing course of conduct that results in across-the-board adverse findings. When, \nas discussed below, the recreational marijuana use deserves less, or even no negative inference on \njudgment, the ensuing analysis is flawed. \nTo that end, a commonsense understanding of the evolving landscape of marijuana law and \npolicy3 in the United States informs us that simple recreational marijuana use no longer holds the \nsame severe negative implications as many other illegal drugs. This is especially, but not \nexclusively, true when the use occurs permissibly under state law. The Whole-Person Concept, \nwhich identifies \u201cnature, extent, and seriousness\u201d among the factors to consider in assessing the \nrelevance of conduct, therefore plays an especially important role in cases alleging prior \nrecreational marijuana use. 4 Recognizing that evolving landscape, the resulting increasing \nprevalence of marijuana use, and the implications of both to national security eligibility, we have \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c). In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the following factors should be considered: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Id. at 2(d). \n2 Such an individualized analysis is regularly conducted under other Guidelines, such as for specific debts alleged \nunder Guideline F or particular foreign relationships alleged under Guideline B. \n3 As of May 2024, recreational adult-use marijuana is legal in 24 states, the District of Columbia, and three territories, \nand its possession is decriminalized in seven states. Additionally, the District of Columbia, three territories, and all \nbut three states permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes. See CONG. RESEARCH SERV., LSB10482, STATE \nMARIJUANA \u201cLEGALIZATION\u201d AND FEDERAL DRUG LAW 3 (2024) (citing https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-medical\u00ad\ncannabis-laws); NCSL: CANNABIS OVERVIEW REPORT, https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/cannabis\u00ad\noverview (last updated June 20, 2024). \n4 This was highlighted by the Security Executive Agent\u2019s 2021 issuance of clarifying guidance, \u201cparticularly in \nresponse to the increase in the number of state and local governments legalizing or decriminalizing uses of marijuana,\u201d \ninstructing that \u201cprior recreational marijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative.\u201d DIR. OF NAT\u2019L INT., Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting \nAdjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (Dec. 2021) [hereinafter Clarifying Guidance] at 1-2. The guidance emphasized not just the requirement for, \nbut also the importance of, the Whole-Person analysis in recreational marijuana cases and identified frequency of use \nand demonstration that future use is unlikely to recur, such as by signing an attestation, as particularly relevant in \nterms of mitigation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncautioned judges about the potential inadequacy of conducting collective analyses in cases alleging \nmixed drug use.5 \nSignificant Differences in Drug Use \nIn light of the foregoing, when significant differences exist to make an applicant\u2019s prior \nrecreational marijuana use distinguishable from his or her use of other illegal drugs, those \ndistinctions represent an important aspect of mixed drug use cases, which a judge must address.6 \nIf, despite consideration of those distinctions in light of the Whole-Person Concept, an unfavorable \ndetermination is still warranted, the judge must articulate a rational basis for why the conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on the applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.7 \nFailure to do so leaves us with serious questions about whether the judge ignored or dismissed that \naspect of the case, failed to take it into account, or failed to understand its significance. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-02195 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2004). \nUnder the facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is distinguishable from his use of \nother illegal drugs, particularly considering the comparative nature, frequency, and recency. \nApplicant disclosed that he used marijuana recreationally with varying frequency beginning in \n2016, including daily until 2021, weekly off-and-on from 2021 through late 2022, and five total \ntimes between late 2022 and his cessation by July 2023. See Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 30-33; \nGE 4 at 5-6. \nApplicant\u2019s other illegal drug use included unprescribed Adderall three times over two \nmonths in 2018, hallucinogens 10 to 20 times over 13 months in about 2019, and cocaine three \ntimes over three months ending in January 2021. At these times, he was 20 to 23 years old. During \nhis security clearance interview, he averred that he \u201ccut off all contact with old coworkers and . . . \nleft the restaurant industry to separate from drug use and users.\u201d GE 4 at 6. \nThe Judge characterized the concerns as \u201c[l]ongstanding illegal drug use\u201d and declined \napplication of any mitigating conditions in the absence of \u201ca lengthier time of sustained abstinence \nfrom the use of marijuana and other illegal drugs.\u201d Decision at 6 (emphasis added). This reflects \nthat the Judge did not distinguish between Applicant\u2019s different drug use, but instead considered \nthem cumulatively and collectively, which impaired his analysis of the Guideline H concern and \nWhole-Person Concept. This should be remedied on remand. \nGuideline H Mitigating Conditions \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to consider his case for mitigation, including the \nspecific timeline of drug use, period of abstinence, and proactive actions taken to overcome the \nconcern. Applicant\u2019s arguments in this regard do more than simply disagree with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the record evidence. Rather, the arguments highlight the absence of any mitigation \n5 I.e., those involving both marijuana use and use of other illegal drugs. See ISCR Case No. 22-02132 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 27, 2023); ISCR Case No. 23-02402 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 19, 2025). \n6 See ISCR Case No. 03-07874 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2005) (failure to discuss an important aspect of a case is error). \n7 See ISCR Case No. 23-02402 at 4 (citing ISCR Case No. 22-02132 at 3). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanalysis in the decision and challenge the Judge\u2019s decision on grounds that it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions and fails to consider relevant factors. \nJudges must apply pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions. See ISCR Case No. \n02-05110 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2004) (citing Directive \u00b6\u00b6 6.3, E3.1.25). If a provision of the \nGuidelines appears to apply to the facts of a particular case, then the judge is obligated to either \napply that provision or give a rational explanation for not doing so. See ISCR Case No. 97-0825 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 1999). Failure to do so is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nHere, the Judge reasonably found that the disclosed and admitted Guideline H concerns \nraised disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).8 Subsequently \u2013 and despite finding that \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s assurances of discontinued marijuana involvement . . . are both plausible and credible \nand are accepted,\u201d and that \u201cApplicant has not engaged in any recurrent use of [the other drugs] \nand has no intent of using them in the future\u201d9 \u2013 the Judge concluded that the drug involvement \nsecurity concerns were not mitigated. In reaching that conclusion, however, he conducted no \napparent mitigation analysis, despite that two conditions were clearly raised by the plain language \nof Guideline H and the facts of the case. The Judge\u2019s failure to apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) or \nprovide a rational explanation for not doing so constitutes harmful error. \nTurning first to AG \u00b6 26(a), the condition affords mitigation when an applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement happened so long ago or infrequently, or under circumstances that make it unlikely \nto recur or not reflective of the individual\u2019s current eligibility worthiness. Apparently viewing \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use collectively with his other drug use, the Judge found that \u201cApplicant\u2019s \nlimited period of cessation of his illegal drug involvement makes it too soon to absolve him of \nrisks of recurrence.\u201d Decision at 6. This conclusion highlights the importance of acknowledging \nthe distinctions between marijuana and other illegal drug use. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use continued with varying but decreasing frequency until July \n2023, two months before submitting his SCA and not yet having begun employment with his \nsponsor. During the time that his use was, at most, weekly, his residential state had decriminalized \nmarijuana possession. By the time of his final five uses between late 2022 and July 2023, \nrecreational adult-use marijuana was legal in his residential state.10 The decreasing frequency and \nchange in legal status are circumstances to be considered in analyzing the applicability of this \ncondition.11 \nConversely, Applicant\u2019s non-marijuana drug misuse was limited in both frequency and \nduration, occurred when he was a young man, and ceased between four and six years ago.

The Judge made cursory reference to some of this \ninformation in his Summary of Pleadings,12 but discussed none of it substantively. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(2) reflect another potential pitfall of collective assessments in \nmixed drug use cases, as seen with Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother. While disassociation \nfrom users and environments linked to certain illegal drugs affords a reasonable gauge of the \nindividual\u2019s current abstinence and future intentions for drug use, it is potentially unrealistic and \ntherefore less reasonable to expect an individual to disassociate from marijuana users and \nenvironments in states that permit recreational adult-use marijuana. \nApplicant also provided a signed statement of intent, as contemplated by AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \nwhich reiterated some of the aforementioned actions and acknowledged that any future drug \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. The decision does \nnot reference this evidence at all. The Judge\u2019s failure to discuss most of Applicant\u2019s mitigating \nevidence, or even mention a particular piece of evidence explicitly identified as potentially \nmitigating under both Guideline H and the Clarifying Guidance constitutes error. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-02195 at 3. \n12 See Decision at 2 (Noting that, in his SOR response, Applicant \u201cclaimed he has not used marijuana since July [2023] \nand has taken other positive steps to overcome this problem (inclusive of disassociating with friends and acquaintances \nwho encourage drug-using behaviors) and taking proactive, healthy steps to take care of himself. He claimed, too, to \nhave [] recently bought a house with his fianc\u00e9e, which has helped to distance himself from his acquaintances.

Having found that \nthe Judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the appropriate remedy is remand or \nreversal. The latter is appropriate when the identified errors cannot be remedied through remand \nand the Board concludes from the record that a contrary formal finding or overall grant or denial \nof security clearance eligibility is the clear outcome. Remand is appropriate when the errors can \nbe corrected and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon correction. See \nISCR Case No. 22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024). Based on this record, we conclude that \nthere is such a chance, and the best resolution of this case is to remand it to the Judge for the \nopportunity to address the errors identified herein and thereafter determine if Applicant has or has \nnot sufficiently mitigated the Government\u2019s concerns. Upon remand, the Judge is required to issue \na new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision; \nhowever, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be appealed.

Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. When a \njudge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or \ncapricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; \nit does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an \nimportant aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the \nrecord evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. \nSee ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding whether \na judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are \ncontrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless? (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds? and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in his findings of fact. As discussed more \nfully below, none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are persuasive. \nInaccurate Claims \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in 26 enumerated ways. We examined all disputed \nfindings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence \nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s allegations of error are without basis. For example, Applicant \nargues that Judge made errors in the dates referenced in the procedural history. She asserts that her \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) was submitted December 17, 2022; that she \u201creceived news \nof a SOR\u201d through her employer in September 2023; that she answered the SOR in October 2023; \nand that the Judge incorrectly stated the date he was assigned as the Judge in this matter. However, \nthe Judge\u2019s dates were supported by the record. \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s factual findings. Most importantly, she claimed that \nthe Judge had reported her payment history for her student loans incorrectly. However, the Judge\u2019s \nfindings on that history came directly from Applicant\u2019s testimony and record evidence. Transcript \n(Tr.) at 64-70. To the extent that she argues that her bank statements and federal student loan \naccount payment history show a history of student-loan payments since 2008, the Judge explicitly \nconsidered that evidence and found \u201cthere are regular \u2018Payments\u2019 but also \u2018Payment Reversals,\u2019 \nas well as Late Fees, detailed. There appears to be little progress made in payments on the principal \nowed in recent years.\u201d Decision at 5. Applicant further asserted that her student loans \u201care all 100% \nconsolidated with online statements from May 2025 exhibits submitted.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits show that she applied to consolidate four federal student loans on January 13, \n2017, and that she successfully consolidated those accounts, with principal totaling about $91,200, \non February 17, 2017. Applicant Exhibit (AE) N at 22; PH 17; PH 18; Government Exhibit (GE) \n7. The resulting consolidated account clearly supplants four of Applicant\u2019s student loan accounts,\nwhich reflected on her credit reports as having historically been paid as agreed and closed in\nFebruary 2017. See, e.g., GE 7 at 2. Importantly, however, the consolidated account does not\nclearly incorporate any of the four student loans that were alleged in the SOR, which continued to\nreport as delinquent on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, even after the appearance of the consolidated\naccount.1 Given these inconsistencies, the Judge\u2019s finding that her student loan status was\n\u201cunclear\u201d is not in error. After the debts alleged in the SOR were substantiated in the Government\u2019s\nexhibits, Applicant had the burden to tie the debts documented in her exhibits and enrolled in the\nconsolidation with those alleged as reflected on her credit reports. In this case, the documentation\ndoes not establish her claims when comparing the dates loans were opened, the original or current\namounts of those loans, or the account numbers. While she documented fluctuating and\ninconsistent payments to some set of student loans over the years, the Judge found that her\npayments did not reduce her debt and \u201cshe still owes well over $100,000 in federal student loans\nmore than 15 years after finishing school,\u201d yet she made expensive purchases like a boat and a\ntimeshare that could have been applied to resolving her debt. Decision at 12. Therefore, she failed\nto establish the requisite good-faith effort to resolve her student loans and did not present a\nmeaningful track record of repayment, nor did she act responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe Judge\u2019s decision on these issues was not arbitrary or capricious. He examined the \nrelevant evidence, offered satisfactory explanations for his conclusions, and his analysis \ndemonstrated a rational connection between the facts relied upon and this decision. \n1 See, e.g., GE 5 at 2-3, 6. Based on the record evidence, including what Applicant describes as unapplied payments \nto her student loan servicer that are not reflected on her federal student loan payment history and concurrent reporting \nof Applicant\u2019s federal consolidated student loan and other delinquent student loans, the latter of which reflect as \n\u201ccharged off\u201d (a status that federal student loans typically cannot achieve), one explanation is that Applicant has two \nsets of student loan debt \u2013 one federal and one private \u2013 and that the private remain delinquent. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s other assertions of error are similarly inaccurate characterizations of the \nJudge\u2019s findings. \u201cWhen the Appeal Board examines individual words or sentences in a Judge\u2019s \ndecision, we do not consider them in isolation. Rather, we consider them in light of the decision \nin its entirety.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2021). For instance, Applicant \nclaims that the Judge found that she purchased her home in 2011, but that it was actually purchased \nin 2001. However, the Judge does not actually say the home was purchased in 2011, but that she \nmoved from the state in which the home was located to another state in 2011. Decision at 7. \nSimilarly, the Judge found: \nOn her March 2023 SCA, Applicant also declared about $91,000 in past-due State \n2 and federal income tax debt from prior years, noting that they were resolved in \n2021 and 2022 by the sale of her home in State 1 noted above. The tax debt was \ndue to under withholdings in earlier years and due to her first divorce. (GE 1 at 57\u00ad\n58; Tr. 122-129) Her tax filings and payments are otherwise current, though she \nowes $1,600 in past-due taxes for tax year 2023. (Tr. 136-139, 189-193) \nDecision at 7. However, Applicant contends: \nThere are no debts that are identical in balance from two separate, non affiliated \nFederal departments. There is not a debt of $91K to the Dept of Education and \nlikewise there has never been a $91K debit to the IRS as stated in Judge Murphy\u2019s \nOpinion. This is a \u201cblending of information\u201d and then an assumption that I owe \n$182,000 combined to two separate Federal Depts when in fact I only owe $35K to \nthe Dept. of Ed. Student Loans vs IRS Taxes are not Both $91K \u2026 which is \nstatistically impossible. \nAppeal Brief at 3. \nApplicant\u2019s critique seems to be based upon a misreading of the Judge\u2019s findings. The \nJudge was highlighting her 2016 IRS debt of about $23,000, her 2017 IRS tax debt of about \n$28,000, and her 2019 IRS debt of $40,000, all disclosed on her SCA and resolved in 2021 or \n2022. GE 1 at 57-58. Those numbers total $91,000. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s findings \nregarding her resolved taxes, which were based on her disclosure. Further, the Judge noted that the \ntaxes were not alleged in the SOR and he did not discuss them in his analysis. \nApplicant also asserts the Judge should have included more context about her divorces. \nWhile Applicant may have preferred that the challenged findings were drafted differently, such \ndissatisfaction does not demonstrate error. Judges have broad latitude and discretion in how they \nwrite their decisions. ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 3 (App. Bd.

(Tr. \n125, 196-197, 206) Even though the Judge erred in these findings, the errors were harmless because \nthey did not likely affect the outcome of the case. ISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, \n1996). \nApplicant also contends that the Judge erred in finding that her income-driven repayment \n(IDR) plan was not approved. The record reflects that Applicant applied for the IDR plan in May \n2024. PH 14. Soon thereafter, a federal court issued an injunction preventing implementation of \nthe plan and the date to begin her IDR plan payments was extended to August 30, 2025. As of the \nclose of the record on May 8, 2025, she had not made payments under the plan. PH 15. On May \n7, 2025, prior to the close of the record, Applicant submitted a narrative statement by email and \nreported that the IDR plan called for payments of $233 monthly thru 2029 for a total of $35,184 \nto be paid under the repayment plan, but neither the attachments to that email nor any other record \nevidence support those repayment details.2 PH 16. Furthermore, even if Applicant\u2019s consolidated \nstudent loan represents all of her past student loan accounts and even if that consolidated loan is \nnot delinquent as a result of her participation in the IDR plan, the Judge could still consider whether \nshe established a meaningful track record of repaying her student-loan debt. The phrase \n\u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment \non debts. ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). Although the Judge technically \nerred in finding that Applicant\u2019s IDR plan was not approved, his finding that Applicant\u2019s IDR plan \nhad not commenced and was not scheduled to until August 2025 is supported by the record, and \nhis conclusions drawn from the fact that Applicant had not established a meaningful track record \nof repayment were reasonable and sustainable. \nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s appeal included new evidence, the Appeal Board is \nprohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 17, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis \nof that decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On February 25, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nApplicant, in his mid-40s, has been employed by a defense contractor as an \nelectromechanical engineer since September 2023. In his October 2023 initial security clearance \napplication (SCA), Applicant disclosed having used marijuana recreationally from 2005 to August \n2023 and stated that he did not intend to use again in the future, acknowledging its inconsistency \nwith holding a security clearance.

Then, in a subsequent response to Government interrogatories, \nApplicant disclosed that his marijuana use had again continued to February 2024, and he reasserted \nthat he had no intention of using the drug in the future and submitted a signed Statement of Intent \nto abstain from all future drug involvement. \nBased on the foregoing information, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from \nMay 2005 to about February 2024, and that he purchased marijuana during that time. In response, \nApplicant admitted both allegations, explaining that his use was minimal and that he has ceased \nall marijuana use and purchase. At hearing, Applicant explained that, after initiating his \ninvestigation, he continued using marijuana as he had before \u2013 recreationally on weekends \u2013 until \nstopping altogether in February 2024. \nBy virtue of Applicant\u2019s admitted marijuana involvement, the Judge found that \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c)1 were applicable. Acknowledging that Applicant \nhad abstained from marijuana use for about a year and had signed a letter of intent against future \ndrug involvement, the Judge considered the applicability of mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and \n26(b),2 but ultimately concluded that that the extent of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use history left \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility and suitability and ruled \nadversely on both allegations. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues generally that the Judge erred by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept, rendering his decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. The Board does not review cases de novo. Rather, the Board addresses the material \nissues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. There is no \npresumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and \nidentify how the judge committed factual or legal error. \nApplicant argues that \u201c[s]everal mitigating factors apply to the facts that were not fully \nconsidered by the Administrative Judge, leading to an incomplete and potentially unfair \nassessment of [Applicant\u2019s] situation under the Adjudicative Guidelines.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. \nAlthough Applicant fails to identify which of the mitigating conditions was applicable but not \nconsidered, he contends that \u201cthe decision disproportionately emphasized the duration and \nfrequency of [Applicant\u2019s] past marijuana use while disregarding the substantial and verifiable \nsteps he has taken toward rehabilitation.\u201d Id. at 9-10. This argument is ultimately tied to the Whole-\nPerson Concept and, for the following reason, is unpersuasive.3 \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse; 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n2 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 26(b): \nthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence \n3 Applicant also explicitly challenges the Judge\u2019s Whole-Person analysis, arguing that he \u201cfailed to properly weigh \n[Applicant\u2019s] longstanding professional record, personal integrity, and demonstrated ability to safeguard classified \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is not necessarily Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use, per se, that raises questions about \nhis judgment and reliability,4 but rather his continued use while aware that using marijuana is \ninconsistent with holding national security eligibility. The Board has \u201clong held that applicants \nwho use marijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct \nmay be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). The evidence in this case \nestablishes that Applicant was on notice when he completed his SCA submission but continued to \nuse marijuana for four subsequent months, despite multiple intervening assertions that he had no \nintention of using in the future and in recognition that such use is illegal under federal law.5 \nApplicant\u2019s post-SCA conduct demonstrated a disregard of national security eligibility standards \nthat negatively reflects on his judgment and reliability and renders this decision sustainable. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. The record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are \nsustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The Judge acknowledged that \u201cApplicant is \nrespected in the workplace and in his community,\u201d but ultimately concluded that the record left questions and doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility, which is sustainable on this record. Decision at 5. \n4 We agree \u2013 to a limited extent \u2013 that the Judge\u2019s emphasis on the duration and frequency of Applicant\u2019s prior \nmarijuana use was misplaced. The Board has recently assessed that \u201ca commonsense understanding of the evolving \nlandscape of marijuana law and policy in the United States informs us that simple recreational marijuana use no longer \nholds the same severe negative implications as many other illegal drugs,\u201d which is \u201cespecially . . . true when the use \noccurs permissibly under state law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 24-00914 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2025) (citations omitted). \nApplicant resides in a state where recreational adult purchase, possession, and consumption of marijuana have been \npermissible under state law for over a decade. The legal status of marijuana where Applicant resides and the fact that \nhe has never previously been granted national security eligibility merit some application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) \nand warranted more discussion and consideration than the Judge gave. Any error, however, is harmless under the facts \nof the case. \n5 See Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 29 (\u201cI do not intend to [use marijuana in the future] because it is prohibited for a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d); GE 2 at 4-5 (asserting no intention to use marijuana in the future after acknowledging that it \nremains illegal under federal law and is inconsistent with being granted access to classified information); Applicant \nExhibit N at 68; Tr. at 37 (Applicant responded affirmatively to the Government\u2019s question, \u201cBut you knew it was \nillegal under federal law, you knew you were applying for a security clearance, you knew you were hoping to get a \nsecurity clearance?

The Judge found against \nher on both Guideline H concerns. 1 \nScope of Review \nOn appeal, the Board does not review a case de novo. Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. When a \njudge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or \ncapricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; \nit does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an \nimportant aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the \nrecord evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless? (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds?; and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \n1 The Judge found favorably regarding the Guideline F case, which is not a subject of this appeal. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings and his Guideline \nH mitigation analysis. For the following reasons, we reverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nErrors in Findings of Fact \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cshe did not supply a written statement of \nintent to avoid marijuana use in the future at the risk of losing her clearance should she elect to \nresume her use of the drug.\u201d Decision at 4 (emphasis added). In support, she points to the following \nstatement included in her SOR response: \u201cI do not use marijuana now (and have not since January \n2023) and am currently enrolled in a drug test/screening program through my current employer. I \nhave no plans to use marijuana or any other drug(s) in the future.\u201d SOR Response at 1.2 Applicant\u2019s \nargument as it pertains to the Judge\u2019s factual finding fails because her statement against future \ndrug use does not, in fact, contain the identified language acknowledging the potential \nconsequence to her national security eligibility. To the extent that she also challenges the Judge\u2019s \nmitigation analysis under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3)3, that too fails because her SOR response falls short of \nthe statement envisioned by the condition. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00535 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nMar. 13, 2017). \nTurning to the next alleged factual error, the Judge found that several individuals \noccasionally used marijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence, including \u201cher mother, stepfather, and her \nhusband\u2019s stepfather,\u201d which Applicant challenges on the basis that she does not have a stepfather \nand has no contact with her biological father. Appeal Brief at 1 (citing Decision at 4 (emphasis \nadded)). The record does not support the Judge\u2019s finding about a secondary stepfather. While it is \npossible that this error is merely typographical and did not, in and of itself, likely affect the \noutcome of the case, the subsequent reliance on Applicant\u2019s association with marijuana-using \nindividuals is problematic, as discussed further, below. \nFinally, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she \u201ctested positive for marijuana in \ndrug tests administered by her former employers.\u201d Decision at 4. This challenge has merit. \nApplicant disclosed that she tested positive for marijuana during the births of her three children \u2013 \na routine step of the labor and delivery process \u2013 which she discussed with her doctor without \nfollow-up. The Judge appears to have misunderstood these tests as a series of employer-sponsored \ndrug tests. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding, the record reflects that Applicant was not subject to \nany employer drug policy while using marijuana, and she has never participated in, let alone tested \npositive during an employer-sponsored drug test. Because using marijuana while under such a \npolicy or failing an employer-sponsored drug test carries negative implications on trustworthiness \nand judgment, we cannot conclude that this error was harmless. \n2 On appeal, Applicant supplements her statement by asserting, \u201cI do acknowledge and understand that any use, \npurchase, cultivation (legal or illegal) will result in the loss of a security clearance, should one be provided to me.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1. This constitutes new evidence, which the Board may not consider. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \n3 AG \u00b6 26(b)(3): \u201c[T]he individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence \nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including . . . providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H Mitigating Conditions \nDespite finding that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)4 were partially \napplicable, the Judge concluded that \u201cApplicant\u2019s lengthy personal history of marijuana use, her \ncontinued purchasing of the drug for herself and her husband, the continued use of marijuana by \nher husband in her presence, and the continued use of marijuana (occasionally in her presence) by \nother family members undercut her commitments to avert all risks of recurrence of marijuana \ninvolvement in the foreseeable future.\u201d Decision at 9. On appeal, Applicant contends that the \nforegoing analysis is flawed because it is based on inaccuracies, including that: 1) Applicant \ncontinues to purchase marijuana for herself; and 2) Applicant\u2019s husband and other family members \nhave used marijuana in her presence after January 2023. Both arguments have merit. \nThe record reflects that, since she stopped using marijuana in January 2023, Applicant \npurchased it twice, both times from a dispensary and for her husband\u2019s use. Tr. at 39. The record \nsupports neither that Applicant\u2019s post-cessation purchases were for herself nor that her purchases \ncontinue to-date. There is no evidence about when these purchases occurred, but Applicant averred \nthat she was unaware until March 2023 that marijuana use remains federally illegal. Government \nExhibit (GE) 2 at 16. With no evidence that Applicant purchased marijuana after being put on \nnotice that the drug is illegal under federal law and inconsistent with holding national security \neligibility, any negative inference gleaned from these state-compliant purchases is unsustainable. \nApplicant also challenges the finding that her husband and other family members continue \nto use marijuana in her presence, which raises issues of both factual and legal error. While \nApplicant acknowledged that various family members used marijuana with or around her prior to \nher cessation,5 there is no evidence in the record that anyone, including Applicant\u2019s husband, has \nused marijuana in her presence after January 2023.6 The Judge\u2019s contrary finding is unsustainable, \nand his reliance on it and the previous finding to conclude that no mitigating conditions fully \napplied was arbitrary and capricious. \nFurther with respect to Applicant\u2019s continued association with marijuana users, the Appeal \nBoard recently assessed that \u201ca commonsense understanding of the evolving landscape of \nmarijuana law and policy in the United States informs us that simple recreational marijuana use \n4 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence \nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. \n5 The record reflects that Applicant\u2019s mother used marijuana in the home when Applicant was younger, and Applicant \npreviously used marijuana with her mother, sister, cousin, father-in-law, and husband. GE 2 at 7. \n6 The record reflects the following regarding Applicant\u2019s association with marijuana users after January 2023: \nApplicant\u2019s husband used marijuana daily in their home until at least October 2023.

April 9, 2025) (citations omitted).7 As a result, we held that \u201cit is potentially \nunrealistic and therefore less reasonable to expect an individual to disassociate from marijuana \nusers and environments in states that permit recreational adult-use marijuana.\u201d Id. at 6. \nHere, Applicant resides in a state where marijuana possession was decriminalized before \nshe began using it as a teenager and recreational adult purchase, possession, and consumption of \nmarijuana have been permissible under state law since 2017.8 It is therefore unrealistic to demand \nthat she disassociate from all recreational marijuana users, particularly family members, to \nestablish her commitment to abstinence. To the contrary, the evidence supports Applicant\u2019s \nsustained commitment to marijuana abstinence, which the Judge acknowledged by finding that she \n\u201chas ceased using marijuana and is committed to abandoning all involvement with the drug in the \nfuture\u201d and \u201cis credited with remaining abstinent from marijuana use herself over the past 24 \nmonths and exhibits no visible signs or indications of succumbing to any risks or pressures she \nmight encounter to return to illegal drug use in the foreseeable future.\u201d Decision at 8. This \ncommitment,9 along with the legal status of marijuana where she resides and the fact that she never \nused the drug while granted national security eligibility or with awareness that it was illegal under \nfederal law, together merit full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nConclusion \nThe Judge\u2019s adverse decision in this matter was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to \nconsider relevant factors and important aspects of the case, and it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence. It is not sustainable. Based on the record before \nus, Applicant\u2019s conduct is mitigated by the circumstances surrounding her prior marijuana use and \nher demonstrated commitment to abstain from use in the future. See ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at \n4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024) (Reversal is appropriate when the Board concludes from the record \nthat a contrary formal finding or overall grant or denial of security clearance eligibility is the clear \noutcome.). \n7 Notably, the Appeal Board issued this decision after the Judge issued his decision in the instant case. \n8 Recreational marijuana is legal in Applicant\u2019s residential state. See, e.g., GE 2 at 16; Tr. at 35. Her residential state \ndefelonized marijuana possession effective October 2001, and legalized the purchase, possession, and consumption \nof adult use marijuana by initiated state statute, effective January 2017.

STAT. \u00a7 \n678D.200 (2020, as amended). \n9 Applicant\u2019s commitment to abstain is bolstered by her assertion that, faced with marijuana use in her presence, she \n\u201cwould leave the premises and not partake.\u201d GE 2 at 16. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-01005 is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: James B.

On \nFebruary 19, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey \ndenied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged eight delinquent consumer and auto debts, all of which \nApplicant admitted with explanation. The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s finances were affected by \nhis 2018 divorce, a circumstance largely beyond his control, and noted Applicant\u2019s explanation \nthat his former spouse \u201copened some accounts without his specific permission to do so or he gave \nher verbal permission to open the accounts without ensuring the debts were paid.\u201d Decision at 7. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had established payment plans for two minor consumer debts and the Judge resolved \nthose in Applicant\u2019s favor. Citing Applicant\u2019s failure to maintain contact with several of his \ncreditors and the absence of payments or payment plans to address most of his delinquent debts, \nthe Judge found adversely on the remaining six accounts that were delinquent for approximately \n$55,000. \nApplicant\u2019s sole challenge on appeal pertains to the Judge\u2019s adverse finding regarding his \nlargest debt \u2013 an auto loan charged off for approximately $34,600. Regarding this account, the \nJudge found that the last payment was made in 2019, that Applicant\u2019s former spouse verbally \nagreed to assume the debt after their divorce and had possession of the vehicle, and that, after \nreceiving the SOR, Applicant decided not to contact the creditor because he believed the debt was \nwritten off. Applicant provided no evidence to corroborate his claim that the debt was dropped \nfrom his credit report, while both his 2023 and 2024 credit reports continued to report the debt and \nreflected it was written off by the original creditor. \nOn appeal, Applicant reiterates that he was unaware that the account was delinquent until \nhis security clearance interview. He argues that the debt should have been subject to a seven-year \nreporting statute of limitations and time-barred from inclusion on his credit report. The Judge \naddressed this same argument at hearing, noting that there are many reasons a debt may be dropped \nfrom a credit report, and that such absence alone is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution or \nsufficient to mitigate the security concern. Decision at 8 (citing ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016)). \nThe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant failed to \u201cestablish that he was unable to make more \ntimely and significant progress resolving his SOR debts\u201d is reasonable and supported by the \nevidence before him, and his conclusion that the \u201cfinancial evidence raises unmitigated questions \nabout [Applicant\u2019s] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d is \nsustainable on this record.1 \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. In the instant case, the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the \ndisqualifying and mitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. \nThe record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On July 31, 2025, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant national \nsecurity eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nApplicant, in his early 30s, earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2019 with majors in applied \nphysics and mechanical engineering. Following his graduation, he began working as a civilian \nengineer with the U.S. military, for which he submitted an initial security clearance application \n(SCA) in May 2019, was granted national security eligibility, and held a Secret security clearance. \nApplicant submitted a new SCA in July 2023 in anticipation of beginning employment with a \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment contractor later that year. He disclosed no illegal drug use in the 2023 SCA; however, \nduring the associated interview two months later, Applicant volunteered that he purchased and \nused marijuana while holding his security clearance, including in the summers of 2020 and 2021. \nApplicant explained that he used marijuana at times when he was home and alone during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, and averred that there was no likelihood of future use, citing his many goals \nand understanding of the gravity of the conduct. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about 2020 to \n2021 while employed in a sensitive position, and his deliberate failure to disclose that use on his \n2023 SCA was alleged under Guideline E. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted both \nallegations. Noting that almost four years had passed since Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use, the \nJudge applied mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)1 to the Guideline H concern, found \nthat Applicant \u201cestablished a pattern of abstinence of marijuana possession and use,\u201d and \nconcluded that his \u201cmarijuana use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment.\u201d Decision at 9. As discussed more fully below, however, the Judge resolved the \nGuideline E concern against Applicant. For the following reasons, we affirm. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge erred in his analyses under \nGuideline E and the Whole-Person Concept. Regarding the former, Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s \nfinding that Applicant intentionally falsified his 2023 SCA on two bases, arguing first that \u201cthe \nrecord demonstrates that this was not a deliberate attempt to mislead\u201d and that \u201cApplicant credibly \ntestified that he misunderstood the scope of the question.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. Counsel also argues \nthat the Judge\u2019s \u201cfinding of falsification rests exclusively\u201d on Applicant\u2019s 2023 SCA. Id. Counsel\u2019s \narguments not only troublingly misrepresent Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony, but also ignore \nsignificant contrary record evidence, beginning with Applicant\u2019s repeated acknowledgements \nabout the intentionality of his omission. \nThroughout his investigation and adjudication, Applicant acknowledged that his failure to \ndisclose reportable marijuana involvement on his 2023 SCA was intentional. During his August \n2023 pre-interview phone call, Applicant alerted the investigator that he had marijuana use to \nreport and explained that he failed to do so on his 2023 SCA \u201cdue to fear.\u201d Government Exhibit 3 \nat 8. Applicant then admitted the intentional falsification in response to the SOR allegation. \nFinally, at hearing, Applicant described his failure to disclose as \u201canother lapse in judgment,\u201d and \nclarified that \u201cit was less fear\u201d and \u201cmore so a lapse in judgment and a mistake at the time.\u201d Tr. at \n18, 22-23. \nCounsel\u2019s attempt \u2013 made for the first time on appeal \u2013 to reframe this admitted and proven \nintentional conduct as an inadvertent \u201cmistake\u201d is without merit. At no time during his hearing \ntestimony or any other point in his adjudication did Applicant suggest that his failure to disclose \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26: (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken \nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas due to misunderstanding the SCA question. Contrary to Counsel\u2019s argument, the evidence that \nApplicant intentionally falsified his 2023 SCA is robust, and the Judge\u2019s finding is sustainable. \nCounsel\u2019s related argument \u2013 that the adverse Guideline E finding is based exclusively on \nthe 2023 SCA \u2013 is similarly unpersuasive and warrants discussion. In support of his argument, \nCounsel contends that \u201cthere is no evidence [that Applicant] has ever attempted to mislead his \nemployer or security officials beyond this single lapse in judgment.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. Putting \naside that this branch of Counsel\u2019s argument seems to acknowledge the intentionality of \nApplicant\u2019s omission and runs afoul of his earlier assertion of simply misunderstanding the SCA \nquestion, Counsel here overlooks that Applicant has, in fact, misled security officials beyond his \n2023 SCA falsification. \nSpecifically, Applicant disclosed no marijuana use on his initial SCA in 2019, and he \nexplicitly denied any marijuana history beyond the 2020 to 2021 involvement at hearing: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Had you ever used marijuana in high \nschool or during college? \nAPPLICANT: I had not. \n. . . \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: When you completed your security \nclearance application, the first one, on May 15th, 2019, right after \nyou finished college, were you truthful about whether you had used \nillegal drugs in the past seven years previous to that? \nAPPLICANT: Yes. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: To include your graduation . . . earlier \nthat month in May of 2019. \nAPPLICANT: Yes. \nTr. at 28. Only upon further questioning directly by the Judge did Applicant eventually disclose \nthat he used marijuana semi-regularly while in college: \nJUDGE: [Y]ou are saying today that you did not use marijuana in \nhigh school or college. You want to stick with that? \nAPPLICANT: Sir, I did not use it in high school, but I did use it in \ncollege. \nJUDGE: About how many times did you use it in college? \n. . . \nAPPLICANT: I would say probably once every two months or so. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTr. at 29. Applicant\u2019s college era marijuana use should have been disclosed on both his 2019 and \n2023 SCAs. It was not. Rather, Applicant concealed the information on both applications and \ncontinued to do so during his eligibility interview and well into his hearing. \nThe Directive is clear that an applicant\u2019s failure to respond truthfully and candidly during \na national security investigation is of special concern, specifically stating that the \u201crefusal to \nprovide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials, or \nother official representatives\u201d in connection with an investigation and adjudication will normally \nresult in an unfavorable eligibility determination. AG \u00b6 15. In cases involving the deliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of material information, an applicant has a \u201cheavy burden \nin demonstrating evidence of reform, rehabilitation, or changed circumstances sufficient to justify \na conclusion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). While the Judge commended \nApplicant\u2019s eventual (albeit, incomplete) disclosure to the investigator in 2023, he ultimately \nconcluded that the concern raised by Applicant\u2019s 2023 SCA falsification was amplified by his \n2019 SCA falsification and that the pattern of omissions prevented full mitigation of the personal \nconduct security concerns. Decision at 12. The Judge\u2019s explanation for his adverse resolution of \nthe Guideline E concern is well supported by the record and Appeal Board precedent and we find \nno reason to disturb it on appeal. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. Our review of the record confirms that the Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this \nrecord. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with \nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant argues that the Judge misinterpreted a series of factual findings. Among the alleged misinterpretations, she asserts that the Judge incorrectly concluded that she did not provide supporting evidence that her employer advised her it was acceptable to use medical marijuana while possessing a security clearance. In her appeal, she noted that she testified about discussing the SOR allegations with \u201csecurity personnel.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2 (citing Transcript (Tr.) at 91). She also argues that the Judge misconstrued her supervisor\u2019s recommendation that she stop using medical marijuana as an order; erred in the frequency and amounts of the marijuana she used; and misidentified her psychiatrist as a therapist. Appeal Brief at 3. These assertions simply argue for an alternative weighing of the evidence.

See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Additionally, Applicant argued that the Judge overlooked Whole-Person evidence that was favorable to her and mischaracterized her testimony and evidence.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 29, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On August 12, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground and Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant, in her late 20s, is unmarried and has no children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2021 and has been employed with a government contractor since 2018. She was first granted \neligibility for access to classified information in 2018, in relation to her employment with the \ngovernment contractor. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from June 2020 until October 2024, \nincluding use while occupying a sensitive position.

In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nusing marijuana from June 2020 to October 2024 and acknowledged that her use was while \noccupying a sensitive position. She provided documentation showing that she had a medical \nmarijuana license issued by her state. Her employer was informed of her medical marijuana use \nprior to her obtaining the \u201cprescription\u201d for marijuana and each time she renewed the prescription. \nApplicant denied an intent to use marijuana in the future \u201cif it jeopardizes [her] security clearance \nor job.\u201d Answer at 4. \nApplicant continued to use marijuana until late March 2025, despite having been placed on \nnotice by the October 2024 SOR that the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency was \n\u201cunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant [her] access to \nclassified information\u201d due to her marijuana use, her use of marijuana while holding a sensitive \nposition, and her future intent to continue to use it. \nIn light of Applicant\u2019s admitted marijuana involvement, the Judge found that disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c)1 were applicable. Acknowledging that Applicant had abstained \nfrom marijuana use since March 2025 and had signed a letter of intent against future drug \ninvolvement, the Judge considered the applicability of mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and \n26(b),2 but ultimately concluded that the extent of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use history left questions \nand doubts about Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility and suitability, and ruled adversely on \nall three allegations. \nScope of Review \nOn appeal, the Board does not review a case de novo. Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. There is \nno presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity \nand identify how the judge committed factual or legal error. \nWhen a judge\u2019s factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether the \nfindings \u201care supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate \nto support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record\u201d and shall give \ndeference to the judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nWhen a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary \nor capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse; 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n2 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion.

In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s factual findings and mitigation analysis and \ncontends that the Judge was biased against her. For the following reasons, we affirm the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. \nChallenges to Findings of Fact \nApplicant argues that the Judge misinterpreted a series of factual findings. Among the \nalleged misinterpretations, she asserts that the Judge incorrectly concluded that she did not provide \nsupporting evidence that her employer advised her it was acceptable to use medical marijuana \nwhile possessing a security clearance. In her appeal, she noted that she testified about discussing \nthe SOR allegations with \u201csecurity personnel.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2 (citing Transcript (Tr.) at 91). \nShe also argues that the Judge misconstrued her supervisor\u2019s recommendation that she stop using \nmedical marijuana as an order; erred in the frequency and amounts of the marijuana she used; and \nmisidentified her psychiatrist as a therapist. Appeal Brief at 3. These assertions simply argue for \nan alternative weighing of the evidence. A disagreement or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Additionally, Applicant argued that the Judge \noverlooked Whole-Person evidence that was favorable to her and mischaracterized her testimony \nand evidence. Again, this argument goes to the weight that the Judge assigned to evidence and \ndoes not establish that the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nThe Judge placed significant weight on Applicant\u2019s choice to continue to use marijuana for \nmedical purposes \u201cdespite noting the illegal drug question when she filled out a March 2022 SCA, \nand after being questioned about her use of medical marijuana during her April 2022 background \ninterview.\u201d Decision at 7. Moreover, even if Applicant was provided incorrect information by her \nemployer\u2019s medical department and a security employee, a reasonable person would have \nsubsequently been placed on notice of the Government\u2019s concerns by the October 2024 SOR. \nFurther, Applicant acknowledged she continued to use marijuana even after her supervisor learned \nof the SOR and suggested she abstain from future marijuana use because marijuana is \u201cfederally \nillegal.\u201d Tr. at 137, 142-143, 146-148. \nApplicant\u2019s continued use of marijuana for medicinal purposes reflects questionable \njudgment and reliability and renders this decision sustainable. The Board has \u201clong held that \napplicants who use marijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of \nsuch conduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). Applicant\u2019s \nconduct demonstrated a disregard of national security eligibility standards. \nAllegation of Bias \nApplicant argues that the Judge was biased and suggests that the decision was improperly \ninfluenced by the Judge\u2019s personal anti-drug advocacy. Appeal Brief at 4. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that administrative judges are impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to \novercome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001) (citations omitted). The issue is not whether the appealing party \npersonally believes that the judge was biased or prejudiced but, rather, whether the record contains \nany indication that the judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the \njudge\u2019s fairness or impartiality. Id. Having examined the record, paying particular attention to the \ntranscript, we find no such indication. Nothing in the record below or the Judge\u2019s decision supports \nApplicant\u2019s claims of bias. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-01030 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer Goldstein \nJennifer Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n5 \n",

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nGrant Couch, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 8, 2024, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct), and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On May 2, 2025, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge John B. Glendon denied Applicant national security \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated in May \n2021 for violations of company policy, misuse of company property, and unprofessional conduct \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his April 2023 security \nclearance application (SCA) for not reporting: his 2021 termination (SOR \u00b61.a); his March 2023 \ncharge of Battery (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and his 2021 civil court action (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The March 2023 Battery \ncharge was alleged independently under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and the civil court action was \nalleged under sexual behavior (SOR \u00b6 3.a). The Judge found against Applicant on all of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nallegations. Our review of the Judge\u2019s decision confirms that he considered all relevant issues and \nproperly applied the mitigating conditions in concluding that Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, \ncriminal conduct, and sexual behavior concerns were unmitigated. Consistent with the following, \nwe affirm. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to consider all relevant evidence \nsubmitted by Applicant, that he failed to give proper weight to record evidence, and that he failed \nto consider applicable mitigating factors. Appeal Brief at 5-8. Specifically, Applicant asserted the \nJudge failed to consider \u201cpositive steps\u201d such as Applicant\u2019s \u201cexemplary employment record, \nglowing letters of recommendation,\u201d and the passage of time since his last incident. Id. \nA judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; \nit fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a \nclear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation \nfor the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be \nascribed to a mere difference of opinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 \n(App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983)).

Sep. 16, 2024). \u201cUnless a Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence is patently absurd, \nclearly illogical, or obviously unreasonable, the appealing party must present a cogent reason or \nargument as to how or why the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2005). Here, Applicant\u2019s brief \nadvocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence under the applicable mitigating conditions \nand the Whole-Person Concept but fails to demonstrate error. An applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with \nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the \nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-17409 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption that \nthe Judge considered all of the record evidence. \nWe have considered the entirety of the arguments contained in his appeal brief. The record \nsupports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, including a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made.

Corrales, Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nMatthew Thomas, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 13, 2024, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2015 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On April 21, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Mark Harvey denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the two Guideline H allegations. These alleged that \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about March 2021 to about April 2024 and \nthat he used marijuana after being granted public trust eligibility or while in a sensitive position. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse determination was \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law and unsupported by the record evidence. For reasons \nstated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \n\n \n \nBackground \nApplicant is in his late 20s and works as an information technology site lead. In 2016, he \ngraduated from high school. He attended two years of college. In 2018, Applicant submitted an \napplication for a public trust position in connection with his employment with a federal contractor. \nFrom 2020 to 2023, Applicant received therapy from a chiropractor to address back pain. \nIn March 2022, the doctor \u201cprescribed\u201d medical marijuana for him, and he received a state issued \nmedical marijuana card. The medical marijuana card authorized him to purchase marijuana under \na state law. \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 5, 2024, security clearance application, he disclosed he used \nmarijuana from March 2021 to February 2024. He also said, \u201cI intend to continue using THC at \nhome medically for my frequent back pain . . . provided to me by the state.\u201d He indicated his \nintention to continue to use marijuana based on the advice of his physician. \nApplicant denied that he used marijuana before 2022. Once he had a marijuana card, he \npurchased marijuana at state-authorized dispensaries. He did not use marijuana during working \nhours or for recreation. He does not associate with known marijuana users or go to locations where \nhe knows marijuana is being used. \nAn Office of Personnel Management investigator asked Applicant if he was willing to end \nhis marijuana use to have a security clearance, and Applicant said yes. In his response to \ninterrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that he became aware that medical marijuana use was \nfederally illegal when applying for and receiving his state\u2019s medical marijuana license. \nGovernment Exhibit 4 at 6. However, he also testified that his doctor told him that marijuana use \nwas legal under federal law, and recommended he use medical marijuana to alleviate his back pain. \nTranscript at 31. He also stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future to further his career \nand to support the Federal Government. \nApplicant sees a chiropractor on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. His chiropractor treatments \nsuccessfully assuaged his back pain. If the chiropractor treatments become ineffective, he does not \nplan to return to his marijuana use. On November 18, 2024, Applicant signed a statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse and to avoid associations with known \ndrug users and environments where illegal drugs are used. He acknowledged that any future \ninvolvement or misuse of drugs is grounds for automatic revocation of national security eligibility. \nOn December 16, 2024, Applicant provided urine and hair samples for drug testing. Both \nsamples were negative for the presence of illegal substances. On January 30, 2025, Applicant \nreceived a psychological evaluation. The evaluating psychologist concluded there was no \ndiagnosis of substance use disorder. She said his prognosis is good and his risk is low for relapse. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that it was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law for the Judge to \nfind against him based on the record evidence. He asserts that SOR \u00b6 1.b should have been found \nin favor of Applicant and that the Judge erred in his mitigation analyses. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse finding on SOR \u00b6 1.b was erroneous for two \nreasons. First, he claims that the Judge failed to articulate a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the adverse finding, it reflects a clear error, and it fails to consider an important aspect \nof the case. He asserts that, because Applicant did not possess a security clearance nor have access \nto classified information during his use of marijuana for medical purposes, it was error for the \nJudge to find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted he used marijuana after being granted \npublic trust eligibility or while in a sensitive position. \u201cIf an applicant admits an SOR allegation, \nthen such admission provides an administrative judge with a legally sufficient basis to find that \nthe applicant engaged in the conduct covered by the applicant\u2019s admission.\u201d ISCR Case 04-09251 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007). \nAdditionally, we note that in his carefully crafted analysis, the Judge declined to apply \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(f) because \u201cthere is insufficient evidence that Applicant was \nholding a sensitive position under AG \u00b6 25(f) when he was using marijuana.\u201d Decision at 9. \nInstead, the Judge found that the record established disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).1 \nApplicant admitted that he possessed and used marijuana, and that he did so after being granted \npublic trust eligibility or while in a sensitive position. The Judge noted that marijuana is currently \nlisted as a Schedule I Controlled Substance. As a Schedule I Controlled Substance, it has no \n\u201ccurrently accepted medical use in treatment.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(a)(1)(B). The SOR concerns \u2015 \nApplicant\u2019s use and possession of marijuana, and his use and possession of marijuana while in a \nposition requiring a designation of trust \u2015 reflect two similar, but different concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, neither of which are improperly analyzed under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). The \nfact that Applicant did not possess a security clearance nor have access to classified information \nduring his use of marijuana is immaterial to the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nMoreover, consideration of Applicant\u2019s status as occupying a position requiring a \ndesignation of trust is consistent with the requirement in the Security Executive Agent\u2019s Clarifying \nGuidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. \n2021) [hereinafter Clarifying Guidance]. The Clarifying Guidance notes, \u201cparticularly in response \n1 Under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c), conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: \u201c(a) \nany substance misuse;\u201d \u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia[.]\u201d Additionally, we note that the \ninstant matter is distinguishable from ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022), where the judge applied \nAG \u00b6 25(f). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto the increase in the number of state and local governments legalizing or decriminalizing uses of \nmarijuana,\u201d that \u201cprior recreational marijuana use by an individual may be relevant to \nadjudications but not determinative.\u201d Clarifying Guidance at 1-2. The Clarifying Guidance \nemphasizes the importance of the Whole-Person Concept2 in marijuana cases in weighing the \n\u201cvariables in an individual\u2019s life to determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security \nconcern, if at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual may now \nreceive a favorable adjudicative determination.\u201d Here, the Judge satisfied the Clarifying \nGuidance\u2019s directive by engaging in a comprehensive Whole-Person analysis that included \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while occupying a position that required a \ndesignation of trust, along with multiple other factors. We are unpersuaded by Applicant\u2019s \nargument to the contrary. The Judge properly considered Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while \nholding a position requiring a designation of trust as \u201ca factor that must be considered in the \nanalysis along with the numerous uses of marijuana (sometimes two or three times a week) from \nabout March of 2021 to about March or April of 2024.\u201d Decision at 9. \nMitigation \nApplicant also contends that the Judge erred in his application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)3; \nhis failure to adequately consider AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d)4; and his application of the Whole-Person \nConcept. \nAG \u00b6 26(a), AG \u00b626(b), and the Whole-Person Concept \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to do a full analysis under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b), and \nthe Whole-Person Concept. We disagree. Applicant\u2019s arguments essentially amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are neither sufficient to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to establish that \nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See \nISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citation omitted). In this case, the Judge \ndiscussed all of the relevant factors. \n2 AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c). In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the following factors should be considered: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Id. at \u00b6 2(d). \n3 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n4 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c): abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs were \nprescribed, and abuse has since ended; 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge found that \u201cApplicant said he ended his marijuana use in March or April 2024, \nand his hearing was on February 6, 2025. He had less than one year of abstinence from marijuana \nuse at the time of his hearing.\u201d Decision at 9. The Appeal Board has \u201cnever established a \u2018bright \nline\u2019 rule as to recency of drug use. The extent to which security concerns may have become \nattenuated through the passage of time is a question that must be resolved based on the evidence \nas a whole.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 14-01847 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2015). Weighing the recency of \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use and his use while in a position of trust amidst all of the other factors, \nthe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Decision at 9. Thus, he fully analyzed AG \u00b6 26(a). \nSimilarly, while crediting Applicant for signing a statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, promising to avoid associations with known drug users \nand environments where illegal drugs are used, and acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse of drugs is grounds for automatic revocation of national security eligibility, the Judge found \n\u201cHe satisfied the requirements of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), except he has not established a sufficient \u2018pattern \nof abstinence of marijuana use.\u2019\u201d Decision at 9 (citing ISCR Case No. 24-00914 at 6 (App. Bd. \nApr. 9, 2025)). In this instance, the Judge articulated a reasonable analysis for his findings under \nAG \u00b6 26(a), AG \u00b6 26(b), and the Whole-Person Concept. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) \nApplicant also asserts that the Judge should have considered the mitigating factors in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d). We disagree. A judge is not required to discuss all of the potentially applicable \nanalytical factors set forth in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 14-06135 at 2 n.1 (App. Bd. Jun. \n15, 2016). Here, the Judge was not required to discuss mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) \nbecause they are inapplicable to the case at hand. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply because marijuana \ncurrently cannot be \u201cprescribed\u201d as a Schedule I drug.5 Applicant presented no evidence that he \nwas prescribed a drug controlled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Similarly, AG \u00b6 26(d) \nis not supported by the evidence. While Applicant\u2019s participation in a psychological evaluation \nand his favorable prognosis constitute evidence that the Judge was bound to consider, it does not \nsatisfy the criteria set forth in AG \u00b6 26(d). See ISCR Case No. 21-00265 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, \n2022). \nConclusion \nBased on our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use from 2021 to 2024 are sustainable and sufficient to support denial of his national \nsecurity eligibility. Applicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \n5 Additionally, Applicant\u2019s [State] Const.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was cited or charged on approximately \n15 occasions for various drug, alcohol, property, driving, and obstruction offenses between 2005 \nand 2014.

On \nOctober 29, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive).

Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged five delinquent debts totaling approximately $46,000. \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three largest debts with explanation and tentatively \ndenied two minor past-due student loans on the basis that she believed they were in good standing \nand were currently paid in advance. She requested that her case be decided based on the written \nrecord and received a complete copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 27, 2025, through which she was notified of her ability to respond with objections or \nadditional information for the Judge to consider. Applicant responded to the FORM with further \nexplanation for her debts and argument for why she should be granted eligibility. She provided no \ndocumentation, in either her response to the SOR or FORM, reflecting the status of her debts or \nefforts to resolve the same. \nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the student loan debts, which had been \nreported as delinquent for about $400 but appeared to be current based on an updated credit report \ncontained in the Government\u2019s FORM. While acknowledging that Applicant \u201chad significant \nperiods of unemployment,\u201d the Judge noted that the last period was in 2019, and Applicant \npresented no evidence of any efforts to resolve the largest debts. Decision at 6. The Judge held \nadversely regarding the three unresolved debts and concluded that \u201cApplicant\u2019s finances cast doubt \non her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.\u201d Id. \nOn appeal, Applicant suggests that the Judge focused on her 2018 unemployment and \nthereby failed to properly consider her \u201cwhole career,\u201d citing to the fact that she has held a security \nclearance since 1988 without issue. Appeal Brief at 1. We interpret this as a challenge to the \nJudge\u2019s analysis under the Whole-Person Concept; however, it is unpersuasive. The Judge \nspecifically noted Applicant\u2019s security clearance history and considered her \u201csignificant periods \nof unemployment, as well as her long history of service to the United States as a military member \nand government contractor,\u201d but ultimately concluded that the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F were not mitigated. Decision at 6. This analysis reflects that the Judge weighed the \nrecord evidence and reached a reasonable conclusion. The Whole-Person analysis is sustainable. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge failed to consider that she has been \u201cup to date\u201d on \nher bills and \u201cworking towards addressing [the] concerns slowly.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. She points to \nno evidence in the record to support this argument, however, other than referring again to being \nahead on her two student loans, which represented about $400 of over $46,000 alleged delinquent \ndebt. In its FORM, the Government identified the lack of documentation regarding any resolution \nefforts (see FORM at 6-7), but Applicant declined to provide such supporting documentation when \ngiven the opportunity to respond. The Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant presented no documentation \nof efforts to resolve the three larger delinquencies, which alone totaled nearly $46,000, and had \nnot demonstrated a plan to resolve them are supported by the record evidence. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. In the instant case, the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the \ndisqualifying and mitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. \nThe record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Applicant disclosed the accounts in his 2023 security clearance \napplication and has consistently explained that his financial problems arose in about 2016 due to \nunderemployment and his eventual decision to stop repaying the credit cards when he was unable \nto afford the minimum payments.

Applying disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c),1 the Judge found that \u201cApplicant never attempted to \nrepay his delinquent debts,\u201d choosing instead \u201cto ignore the debts until they were eventually \nunenforceable under the statute of limitations.\u201d Decision at 7. Noting that he \u201cprioritized his future \nfinancial goals at the cost of his past creditors,\u201d the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201cdecision to \nnot address his delinquent debt for nearly a decade continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.\u201d Id. at 8. \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nclaims of error with specificity. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30. The Appeal Board does not review cases de \nnovo and our authority to review a case is limited to matters in which the appealing party has raised \na claim of harmful error. Applicant has not alleged any such error. Rather, Applicant\u2019s appeal \nchallenges the Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b), arguing that he has \u201cboth the ability \nand the willingness to settle these debts,\u201d and requests that he be given 24 months to do so if that \n\u201cwould satisfy the grounds to reinstate [his] trustworthiness of a security clearance.\u201d Appeal Brief. \nWe interpret Applicant\u2019s appeal as a request for conditional security eligibility. Appendix \nC of SEAD 4 provides authority to grant conditional security eligibility, \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that \nadditional security measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d Applicant did not request \nconditional eligibility at hearing and nothing in the record supports a conclusion that the Judge \nerred in not granting it. Moreover, although Appendix C provides authority to grant conditional \nsecurity eligibility,2 our review of the record below reflects no evidence of proposed additional \nsecurity measures or the efficacy thereof. Accordingly, Applicant has not established that the \ngranting of an exception under Appendix C is merited. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Rather, the Judge examined and weighed the disqualifying and mitigating \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant filed for bankruptcy five times, \nincluding under Chapter 7 in 2009, which resulted in discharge, under Chapter 13 in 2012, 2014, \nand 2015, all of which were dismissed for failure to make plan payments, and finally under Chapter \n7 in 2018, which again resulted in discharge.

In \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant denied two consumer debts \u2013 one as fraudulent (SOR \u00b6 2.g) and \nthe other as belonging to his father (SOR \u00b6 2.h). He admitted the remaining debts and bankruptcies \nwith explanation. The Judge resolved one allegation favorably \u2013 a minor judgment entered against \nApplicant in 2023 (SOR \u00b6 2.i) \u2013 and resolved the remaining Guideline F allegations adversely.1 \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse finding regarding the debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 2.h, reiterating his denial of liability on the basis that he was merely an authorized user on \nthe account that belonged to his father. The Government acknowledged that Applicant was an \nauthorized user on the account but argued that \u201c[a]s an authorized user, Applicant is still \nresponsible for the debt.\u201d File of Relevant Material at 4. The Judge found that Applicant failed to \ndocument his father\u2019s liability for the debt sufficiently and declined to find the debt mitigated. \nContrary to the Government\u2019s argument and the Judge\u2019s finding, however, Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport confirms that Applicant was only an authorized user on the account2 and, as such, he bears \nno liability for the debt. The Judge erred in resolving this debt adversely; however, considering \nthe scope of the remaining SOR allegations resolved unfavorably \u2013 including Applicant\u2019s lengthy \nhistory of bankruptcy and incurring over $18,000 of additional delinquent debt since the last \ndischarge in 2018, the erroneous adverse finding on SOR \u00b6 2.h\u2019s $1,200 debt was harmless. See \nISCR Case No. 00-0250 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2001). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal fails to allege any error by the Judge. Instead, he \nreiterates the circumstances leading to his financial problems and advocates for a different \nweighing of those circumstances under the Whole-Person Concept, which is insufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(citation omitted). \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Rather, the Judge examined and weighed the disqualifying and mitigating \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \n1 The Judge resolved the Guideline E falsification concern in Applicant\u2019s favor. Although Applicant on appeal \nreiterates his explanation for not disclosing reportable financial issues on his SCA, thereby implicitly challenging the \nGuideline E allegation, the Judge\u2019s favorable finding on this concern renders Applicant\u2019s appeal argument moot. \n2 Government Exhibit (GE) 12 at 3. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-01532 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

He graduated from high school in 1999 and served on active \nduty in the United States military from 2000 until his honorable discharge in 2020. Applicant \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in March 2020 and was subsequently employed as an industrial security \nrepresentative with a DoD contractor until June 2023, when he was terminated for violation of a \ncompany policy for falsifying business records.

The SOR alleged concerns \nstemming from his terminated employment, and the Judge found against Applicant on the \nfollowing alleged conduct. \nUnder Guideline K and Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged multiple instances of \nApplicant\u2019s improper security practices between December 2022 and May 2023, including that he: \nfailed on numerous occasions to conduct required checks in classified open storage areas and \nfalsified related completion records; failed to alarm a room; failed to properly escort an employee, \nwho was left unescorted in a closed area; failed to secure a safe; failed to secure and alarm the \ndoor for a closed area; failed to properly secure program coversheets with codewords; and failed \non numerous occasions to properly complete required logs for security containers. Many of the \nincidents resulted in employer counseling. The SOR further alleged under Guideline E that \nApplicant falsified material information during his national security eligibility interview by failing \nto disclose the foregoing conduct and certain other instances of workplace discipline. \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nclaims of error with specificity. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30. On appeal, Applicant raises no claim of \nharmful error on the part of the Judge.

On \nNovember 5, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On July 1, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger \nC. Wesley denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant carried four delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$36,000. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations with explanation and requested \nthat his case be decided based on the written record. On February 14, 2025, he received a complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material and was notified of his ability to respond with \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany objections or additional information for the Judge to consider.

Appeal \nBrief at 1. Applicant\u2019s argument, which we interpret as a challenge to the Judge\u2019s analysis under \nthe Whole-Person Concept, is unpersuasive. The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect \na \u201cpattern of accruing multiple delinquent debts and acquiescing in their falling off his credit \nreports without addressing them,\u201d and that his expressed commitments to address the \ndelinquencies were supported by neither evidence of repayment efforts nor changes in financial \npractices. Decision at 3. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s financial statement reflected a monthly net \nremainder of approximately $5,000 after all other expenses were paid, but the SOR debts were not \nbeing addressed and Applicant provided no information about how the funds were being used. The \nJudge opined that \u201cApplicant [was] entitled to credit for his work in the defense industry\u201d but \nconcluded that \u201chis efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his repeated failures or inability \nto address his delinquent debts.\u201d Decision at 6. The Judge\u2019s analysis reflects that he weighed the \nrecord evidence and reached a reasonable conclusion, including in consideration of the Whole-\nPerson Concept. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Rather, the Judge examined and weighed the disqualifying and mitigating \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On June 2, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nLeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged five financial concerns, including Applicant\u2019s failure \nto file both federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2019 and three delinquent consumer \ndebts that totaled approximately $30,800. In his October 27, 2024, answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the allegations, submitted documentation of efforts to resolve his three consumer debts, \nand elected a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 9, 2024, the \nGovernment submitted its written case and provided Applicant with a complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM).

In his decision, the Judge \nacknowledged that Applicant had resolved the debts and filed his tax returns but nevertheless \nfound adversely on all allegations, primarily because of the post-SOR timing of Applicant\u2019s \nmitigation efforts. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not assert that the Judge committed any harmful error. Rather, \nApplicant focuses on his own election for a decision on the written record rather than a hearing. \nHe now regrets that decision and asserts that it was made \u201cwithout legal representation and while \n[his] mental health was compromised\u201d and with \u201cno way of knowing what [his] options were at \nthe time.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. He cites to a friend\u2019s crisis in late December 2024 that required his \nfull attention and compromised his ability to make an informed decision. \nTo the extent that Applicant is contending he did not receive the due process afforded by \nthe Directive, we are not persuaded. When the SOR was issued in early October 2024, Applicant \nwas provided a copy of the Directive, which contained detailed information about his rights and \nresponsibilities. Applicant submitted responsive documents and elected a decision on the written \nrecord in late October 2024, well before his attention was diverted by his friend\u2019s crisis in \nDecember 2024. There is nothing in the record to suggest that either Applicant\u2019s choice of an \nadjudication on the written record or his decision to represent himself was other than knowing and \nintelligent. \nApplicants are entitled to receive their full measure of due process under Executive Order \n10865 and the Directive, but they are not entitled to be relieved of the consequences of decisions \nand choices they make on how to proceed with their case simply because they are not satisfied \nwith the results. Absent a showing of factual or legal error that affects an applicant\u2019s right to \npresent evidence in the proceeding below, an applicant does not have the right to a second chance \nat presenting his case before an administrative judge. Although pro se applicants are not held to \nthe standards of attorneys, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their \nrights. E.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). Applicant requests remand of \nhis case to afford him the opportunity for a hearing. The Board only has authority to remand a case \nto correct an error identified in the proceeding below. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.33.2. Applicant has failed \nto establish that any error occurred below. \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant was given sufficient notice of his rights and that \nhe availed himself of those rights by submitting documents in response to the FORM, including a \nlengthy narrative and updated payment information. Having decided to represent himself after \nhaving properly been advised of his rights, Applicant cannot fairly complain about the quality of \nhis self-representation. We conclude that Applicant was not denied the due process afforded by \nthe Directive and that the decision of the Judge is sustainable. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-01671 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 11, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On May 21, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-20s and has been employed by a federal contactor since August \n2022. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2022. He has lived with his girlfriend since \nSeptember 2022. \n\n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nJanuary 2018 to about March 2024, and that he purchased marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout January 2018 to about July 2021. Applicant admitted both allegations. He acknowledged \nthat he obtained a medical marijuana card in July 2019. He purchased marijuana products at a \ndispensary using his medical marijuana card until about 2021 or 2022. The date the card expired \nvaries in the record. He used the marijuana products on Friday and Saturday nights to help him \nsleep. He stopped using marijuana in 2021 or early-to-mid 2022. However, he used it again on one \noccasion in 2024 with his girlfriend, who continues to use medical marijuana. They have an \nagreement that she will not smoke it in the house when Applicant is present. \nScope of Review \nOn appeal, the Board does not review a case de novo. Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. When a \njudge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or \ncapricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; \nit does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an \nimportant aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the \nrecord evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless? (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds? and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant raises three separate issues. First, he contends that the Judge erred in \nthe Findings of Fact when the Judge found, \u201cHe testified that after he graduated from college in \nMay 2022, he knew that he wanted to work as a federal contractor in engineering and aerospace, \nand he stopped using marijuana.\u201d Decision at 2. In Applicant\u2019s appeal, he clarified he stopped \nusing marijuana in January of 2022, as he stated during the hearing. Transcript (Tr.) at 16. This \nsix-month difference did not appear to weigh heavily in the Judge\u2019s decision, and the record \nevidence fluctuates between 2021 and 2022 for the date of last use. For instance, the Judge also \nnoted that Applicant \u201cstopped using marijuana in July 2021, when his marijuana card expired.\u201d \nDecision at 2. However, Applicant testified his card expired in 2022. Tr. at 16. An error is harmless \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nif it is not outcome determinative. See ISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 1996). \nThese discrepancies in dates were due to differences in the record, as reported by Applicant. \nFurther, the Judge\u2019s analysis focused on Applicant\u2019s choice to use marijuana with his girlfriend on \none occasion in March 2024, after previously abstaining from marijuana use. We conclude that \nany error in these dates was harmless and likely did not affect the outcome of the case. \nSecond, Applicant asserts that the Judge was biased toward the Government. He asserts \nthat their apparent familiarity led him to conclude their relationship \u201chad some effect on the \ndecision made.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that a judge is impartial and \nunbiased, and a party seeking to rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See \nISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \u201cThe issue is not whether Applicant \npersonally believes the Judge was biased or prejudiced against Applicant. Rather, the issue is \nwhether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a \nreasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge. Bias or prejudice is not \ndemonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached unfavorable \nconclusions. Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such \nerror, standing alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudice.\u201d See ISCR Case \nNo. 04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007) (internal citations omitted). Here, Applicant points to \nthe fact that \u201cthe [Department] counsel was already well known and liked by the judge\u201d as evidence \nof bias. Appeal Brief at 2. However, Applicant points to no action that would show unfairness or \nimpartiality in the eyes of a reasonable person, and our review of the record reveals none. Applicant \ndid not rebut the presumption that the Judge was impartial, unbiased, and professional. \nFinally, Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence under the \napplicable mitigating conditions and the Whole-Person Concept but fails to demonstrate error. An \napplicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). These arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and the \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \n3 \n\nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-01713 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer Goldstein \nJennifer Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n4 \n",

On February 20, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged both that Applicant used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from July 2017 to about September 2024 and that he intended to continue to use \nmarijuana in the future. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted his past use, denied any \nintent to use in the future, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing.

Applicant was previously granted public trust eligibility in 2018, while working \nfor a different government contractor. \nIn his April 2024 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he used \nmarijuana from July 2017 to March 2024. In his June 2024 personal subject interview (PSI) with \nan investigator, Applicant admitted that he continued to use marijuana through June 2024. In his \nOctober 2024 SOR answer, he admitted his use of marijuana extended through September 2024. \nDuring his PSI, Applicant explained that he used marijuana occasionally at home or at a \nfriend\u2019s house on weekends to relax or for social purposes. Applicant acknowledged his awareness \nthat marijuana use violated federal law. Applicant stated that he used marijuana prior to holding a \nposition of trust in 2018, ceased using while holding the position, and resumed use after he was no \nlonger in the position. He stated that he intended to continue his marijuana use because he likes \nthe way it makes him feel but stated that he would stop using it once he is cleared. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he highlighted that he stopped using marijuana when \nhe held a position of trust in approximately 2018 and that he can stop using again, especially \nbecause he is older now and is less impulsive. \nThe Judge found that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g)1 were applicable. \nAlthough the Judge considered the applicability of mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b),2 \nhe ultimately concluded that neither fully applied: \nApplicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana was frequent and was as recent \nas September 2024. It is troubling that Applicant continued using marijuana when \nhe was fully aware doing so violated federal law. He continued to use marijuana \nafter he completed his April 2024 SCA, after he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator in June 2024, and during the same month as he received the SOR. \nAlthough Applicant stated he no longer intends to use marijuana in the \nfuture if he is granted a clearance, he failed to provide a signed statement of his \nintent not to use or misuse drugs in the future. Even though he apparently stopped \nusing marijuana when he held a position of trust, his recent resumption casts doubt \nupon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. [Decision at 5.] \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse; 25(g): expressed intent to continue drag involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n2 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge erred both in his mitigation analysis and in \n\u201cimproperly considering criminal conduct which was not raised in the Statement of Reasons \npursuant to Guideline J.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in his AG \u00b6 26(a) mitigation analysis in that he failed \nto consider that Applicant\u2019s prior use \u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur.\u201d Id. at 4. Applicant highlights that he stopped using marijuana while holding a position of \npublic trust and that he has promised to stop using again. Consequently, Applicant argues, his \n\u201cusage outside of a position of public trust does not cast doubt upon his reliability and \ntrustworthiness as he has effectively demonstrated that he can abide by the law, rules, and \nregulations imposed upon a security clearance holder.\u201d Id. at 5 (emphasis added). Applicant \ncontends that the Judge \u201cconsidered only the recency of [his] usage, but failed to consider the other \nfactors expressly articulated in AG \u00b6 26(a), namely whether the usage occurred under specific \ncircumstances.\u201d Id. \nApplicant misconstrues the Judge\u2019s analysis, which is well-rooted in Appeal Board \nprecedent. The dispositive factor in the Judge\u2019s analysis was that Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana after becoming aware that such use is inconsistent with holding national security \neligibility. Although Applicant may have ceased using while employed in a position of public trust, \nApplicant began to use again upon leaving that position and continued to use after being hired by \nanother federal contractor, after filling out an SCA, and after being interviewed by a Government \ninvestigator. The Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use marijuana after having been placed \non notice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the judgment and \nreliability expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). The evidence in this case establishes that Applicant was on notice due \nto prior eligibility, that he was using again when he completed his SCA for his current position, \nand that he continued to use during the adjudicative process, despite acknowledging that such use \nis illegal under federal law.3 Applicant\u2019s post-SCA conduct demonstrated a disregard of national \nsecurity eligibility standards that negatively reflects on his judgment and reliability and renders \nthis decision sustainable. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. The record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are \nsustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n3 Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge erred in considering the non-alleged criminality of his conduct is wholly without \nmerit. Guideline H explicitly and repeatedly references \u201cillegal\u201d drug use. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s novel argument \nthat Applicant \u201cwas not on notice that the illegality of his actions would be considered in the determination of whether \nto grant him a security clearance,\u201d the SOR clearly put him on notice that his illegal use of a controlled substance was \nin issue.

He served in the military from 2013 to 2017 and earned numerous awards and medals. In 2017, Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in general studies. In 2021, he graduated magna cum laude with departmental honors and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry. In 2022, he received a master\u2019s degree in biomedical science. He received a prestigious award in his professional specialty and published five professional scientific articles. He is engaged to be married, and he does not have any children. He received an award for being employee of the month in fall 2024. Applicant first used marijuana in high school. He did not resume his marijuana use until he was in graduate school around March 2023, when it was legalized in his state under state law. Since marijuana possession and use were not prohibited under state law, he believed his use was legally permissible. He did not investigate the applicability of federal laws concerning marijuana. Applicant usually used marijuana on weekends and rarely used marijuana during the week. He purchased marijuana about twice a month and used at his residence.

On \nDecember 26, 2024, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2015 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On June 16, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Mark Harvey denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on two of the three Guideline H allegations. These \nalleged that Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about March \n2023 to about November 2024 while occupying a sensitive position. The third allegation \u2015 that \nApplicant intended to continue to use marijuana \u2015 was found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in the adverse finding.

In 2010, he \ngraduated from high school. He served in the military from 2013 to 2017 and earned numerous \nawards and medals. In 2017, Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in general studies. In 2021, \nhe graduated magna cum laude with departmental honors and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nchemistry. In 2022, he received a master\u2019s degree in biomedical science. He received a prestigious \naward in his professional specialty and published five professional scientific articles. He is \nengaged to be married, and he does not have any children. He received an award for being \nemployee of the month in fall 2024. \nApplicant first used marijuana in high school. He did not resume his marijuana use until \nhe was in graduate school around March 2023, when it was legalized in his state under state law. \nSince marijuana possession and use were not prohibited under state law, he believed his use was \nlegally permissible. He did not investigate the applicability of federal laws concerning marijuana. \nApplicant usually used marijuana on weekends and rarely used marijuana during the week. He \npurchased marijuana about twice a month and used at his residence. Once his fianc\u00e9e obtained \nemployment, she ended her marijuana use. On December 1, 2023, Applicant received a security \nclearance and signed a nondisclosure agreement. He most recently used marijuana in December \n2024 or early January 2025. He was unsure if he used marijuana shortly before or after he received \nthe SOR. \nApplicant described his past marijuana use as limited and aligned with state law. He did \nnot believe it posed a risk to national security or his ability to safeguard classified information. \nApplicant acknowledged the seriousness of the concerns raised in the SOR and asked that the \nsecurity concerns be mitigated. He indicated that he strives to uphold the highest standards of \nintegrity and responsibility and that he is committed to adhering to all federal, departmental, and \ncontractual requirements related to his security clearance. \nDiscussion \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nclaims of error with specificity. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30. To the extent that the Applicant\u2019s appeal \nincluded new evidence, the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence under the \napplicable mitigating conditions and the Whole-Person Concept, but he fails to demonstrate error. \nAn applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for \na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.

For reasons \nstated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-20s and works as a manufacturing engineer for a government \ncontractor since February 2024. He is unmarried and has no children. He attended high school \nfrom August 2015 to May 2019. In 2023, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2024. On the section of \nthe SCA that asked about his police record, he disclosed his 2017 charge for possession of \nmarijuana and his 2018 charge of possession of paraphernalia. Under the questions about illegal \ndrug use or drug activity, Applicant disclosed he purchased and used marijuana \u201conly a few times\u201d \nbetween May 2018 and October 2022. Government Exhibit (GE) 1. He noted on his SCA that, \n\u201cThere is no reason for me to use it. It did not give any benefits to me. I just ended up trying it \nwhen I was in college. I do not plan to use it ever again.\u201d Id. \nHowever, when he participated in his April 22, 2024 subject interview and answered \ninterrogatories in December 2024, he disclosed additional drug use. He listed that he used \nmarijuana occasionally between May 2016 and October 2024, including twice since completing \nhis SCA. He also disclosed that he used \u201cmushrooms\u201d two times between June 2019 and December \n2022. He tried cocaine \u201ca few times\u201d between March 2021 and June 2021. Additionally, he \nmisused two prescription drugs: Xanax from November to December 2021 and Adderall from \nSeptember 2019 to May 2023. GE 2. \nApplicant asserted that his drug use was experimental. He attributed his use of marijuana \nin September and October of 2024, while working for his current employer and having an interim \nclearance, to anxiety related to the deaths of two friends. He acknowledged he made a mistake in \nusing it. On May 8, 2025, he provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse would \nbe grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He has never been treated or counseled \nfor abuse of drugs. \nDiscussion \nApplicant first contests the Judge\u2019s factual findings that Applicant admitted he was arrested \nand charged with Possession of Marijuana in May 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and that he was arrested and \ncharged with paraphernalia in May 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant has never been arrested. In both \ninstances, Applicant was only issued a \u201cticket\u201d with the charges cited. In his Answer to the SOR, \nhe denies that he was arrested for either charge and there is no evidence in the record to support \nthat Applicant was arrested. While the Judge erred in stating that Applicant was arrested for both \ncharges, the Judge found both allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. As a result, these errors are \nharmless because they did not affect the adverse outcome of the case. See ISCR Case No. 11\u00ad\n15184 at 3 (App. Bd.

Corrales, Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 11, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On July 14, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nBraden M. Murphy denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant carried seven delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$62,000, all of which he admitted and attributed to his 2021 divorce and resulting financial strain. \nCiting Applicant\u2019s financial decisions and failure to begin to address the debts until after he \nreceived the SOR in late 2024, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s debts continue to cast doubt \non his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, and he resolved four outstanding debts totalling \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmore than $54,000 adversely. On appeal, Applicant requests reconsideration of the decision, \narguing that the Judge failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person \nConcept. \nApplicant first contends that AG \u00b6 20(d) 1 was fully mitigating and argues that the Judge \nimproperly emphasized the recency of Applicant\u2019s debt resolution efforts and ignored that he \n\u201cacted promptly after receiving the [SOR], retained legal counsel, and began resolution before the \nhearing.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. This argument is unpersuasive. It is well-settled that the timing of debt \nresolution efforts is an important factor in evaluating mitigation \u201cbecause an applicant who begins \nto resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there \nis no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, \n2017). Moreover, until an applicant has a \u201cmeaningful financial track record,\u201d it cannot be said \n\u201cthat he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2003). Here, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s post-SOR efforts were insufficient to establish such a track record or to fully mitigate \nthe financial concerns is reasonable and supported by the record and Appeal Board precedent. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge erred in failing to apply AG \u00b6 20(b)2 and insufficiently \nweighed that the debts resulted from circumstances beyond his control, i.e., his 2021 divorce and \nrelated financial obligations. In this regard, the Judge found that \u201cApplicant\u2019s debts originated due \nto overspending and living beyond his means during his second marriage,\u201d that he accepted \nresponsibility for the debts in his divorce settlement, and that, although he prioritized his child \nsupport payments over addressing his delinquencies, he also \u201cpurchased several expensive trucks \nand sports cars in recent years, all with high sale prices and large monthly payments.\u201d Decision at \n7. Additionally, in about April 2024, Applicant refinanced his mortgage and followed bad financial \nadvice \u201cto ignore his debts so they would age out of the statute of limitations and become \nuncollectible.\u201d Id. at 7. Considering these unchallenged factual findings, the Judge reasonably \ndeclined to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(b) and we find no reason to disturb that decision on appeal. \nApplicant\u2019s final challenge \u2013 to the Judge\u2019s analysis under the Whole-Person Concept \u2013 \nagain merely advocates for a different weighing of the evidence, which is insufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(citation omitted). Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the Judge acknowledged his 20-year military \nservice, related service awards, and honorable discharge, his lengthy security clearance history, \nand his personal and professional recommendations, but found that \u201cApplicant\u2019s debts remain \nlargely unresolved, and he has only recently begun a good-faith effort to address them.\u201d Decision \n1 AG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n2 AG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 8. Accordingly, the Judge reasonably concluded that the record left \u201cquestions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Id. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Rather, the Judge examined and weighed the disqualifying and mitigating \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-01994 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned:  Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.
