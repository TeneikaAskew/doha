    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted both allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 55-year-old process mechanic employed by a defense contractor since November 2018. He worked for non-government employers from May 1994 to June 2018 and was unemployed for five months before being hired for his current job. He married in May 1990 and has three adult children, ages 29, 25, and 22. His security clearance application reflects that he has never held a security clearance. (FORM Item 4 at 30.) When Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he disclosed that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018. He explained that he needed to obtain additional paperwork, some of which had be obtained by his dependents. He stated that he had begun the process of obtaining the necessary paperwork. (FORM Item 4 at 30-31.) When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2019, he admitted that he did not have a good reason for not filing his income tax returns. He told the investigator that it took substantial time to gather his paperwork and that he \u201cgot lazy\u201d and did not finish gathering his paperwork. He also told the investigator that he had hired a tax professional to prepare his returns, that his returns had been completed, and that he intended to file them within the next two or three months.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/20/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 4, 2019. On October \n22, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 20, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on January 10, 2020. On the same day, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n\n \n2 \n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on January 30, 2020, and did not respond. The case was assigned \nto me on March 10, 2020.  \n \nThe FORM included a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \non May 23, 2019. (FORM Item 5.) The PSI summary was not authenticated as required \nby Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions \nor updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. I conclude that Applicant waived any objections to the PSI summary by \nfailing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like \nlawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights \nunder the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted both allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old process mechanic employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 2018. He worked for non-government employers from May 1994 to June \n2018 and was unemployed for five months before being hired for his current job. He \nmarried in May 1990 and has three adult children, ages 29, 25, and 22. His security \nclearance application reflects that he has never held a security clearance. (FORM Item 4 \nat 30.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he disclosed that he \nhad failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and \n2018. He explained that he needed to obtain additional paperwork, some of which had be \nobtained by his dependents. He stated that he had begun the process of obtaining the \nnecessary paperwork. (FORM Item 4 at 30-31.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2019, he \nadmitted that he did not have a good reason for not filing his income tax returns. He told \nthe investigator that it took substantial time to gather his paperwork and that he \u201cgot lazy\u201d \nand did not finish gathering his paperwork. He also told the investigator that he had hired \na tax professional to prepare his returns, that his returns had been completed, and that \nhe intended to file them within the next two or three months. (FORM Item 5 at 4.)  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he intended to file his past-due \nfederal and state income tax returns by the end of the year. However, he did not respond \nto the FORM. Thus, there is no evidence that the returns have been filed. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n\n \n4 \n \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file, as required, his federal and \nstate income returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The \nsecurity concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(f) \n(\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n \n5 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s failures to \ntimely file his tax returns are numerous, recent, and did not occur under circumstances \nmaking recurrence unlikely. He submitted no evidence of conditions largely beyond his \ncontrol. He has received assistance from a tax professional, but his tax problems are not \nresolved. Notwithstanding his repeated promises to file his tax returns, he submitted no \nevidence that they have been filed. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his repeated failure to timely \nfile his federal and state income tax returns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 12, 2014. On \nOctober 29, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nI. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security\nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10,\n2016).\nApplicant answered the SOR on November 14, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n22, 2020. The case was assigned to me on February 10, 2020. On March 12, 2020, the \n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for April 2, 2020. On March 17, 2020, the hearing was cancelled because of \nDOD workplace and travel restrictions based on health concerns posed by the COVID-\n19 virus. \n \nOn July 24, 2020, DOHA notified Applicant that the hearing was rescheduled for \nAugust 25, 2020. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1, \n3, and 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX 2, an unauthenticated summary \non an interview with Applicant during his background investigation, was not admitted. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were \nadmitted without objection.  \n \nI kept the record open until September 11, 2020, to enable Applicant to present \nadditional medical evidence and character references. He timely submitted AX H through \nO, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 2, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 \n1.f, which he denied. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. The facts alleged in the SOR are identified by parenthetical citations \nto the SOR in italics and bold print. \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old information technology (IT) specialist employed by a \ndefense contractor. He is a site lead and supervises an eight-member team. (Tr. 23-24.) \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 2012 to March 2019 and \nreceived an honorable discharge. He was discharged early after a medical evaluation \nboard determined that he was suffering from fibromyalgia, a musculoskeletal disorder \noften accompanied by fatigue, sleep issues, and mood issues.1 (Tr. 23-24.) He held a \nsecurity clearance while on active duty and retained it as the employee of a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 6.) He married in May 2011 and has two children and two stepchildren. \n(Tr. 23.) He has taken college classes online but does not have a degree. (GX 2 at 5.) \n \nIn February 2014, while deployed overseas, Applicant complained of daily \nheadaches and chest pain. He was sent back to the United States before completing his \ntour of duty. (Tr. 25.) In the United States, he underwent a CT scan of his head and brain \nto determine the cause of more than two months of daily headaches and dizziness. The \nscan reflected \u201cno appreciable parenchymal mass, hemorrhage, or edema\u201d and no acute \nintracranial abnormality. The medical report recommended that an MRI be conducted if \nclinical concerns persisted. (AX B.) He received no treatment, except for injections of \nBotox to relieve his headaches. (Tr. 27.) \n \n                                                          \n1 The fibromyalgia definition is at www.mayoclinic.org/diseases/conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes. \n\n \n3 \n \nIn early 2017, Applicant was again deployed overseas and separated from his \nfamily. In April and May 2017, Applicant went to his unit\u2019s behavioral health clinic and \nreported that he was irritable and tired and experiencing stress to due poor leadership in \nhis unit. He was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed \nmood. (GX 4 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he experienced recurrent and severe \nheadaches. He was in a high-pressure job, working 12-hour shifts, and unable to sleep. \nHe testified that he sought medical help, but his supervisors made him cancel his \nappointments. He told his superiors that he had considered suicide. (Tr. 28.) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nHe threatened his detachment sergeant and platoon sergeant, because he believed they \nwere the cause of his continuous pain. (Tr. 29) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) An incident report reflects \nthat he threatened to \u201ckill/injure\u201d them, but he testified at the hearing that he wanted to \nhurt them but not kill them. (GX 3; Tr. 29-30.) He was admitted as an inpatient in a \npsychiatric unit during June and July 2017 and was prescribed sleep medication and \npsychotropic medications. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He was moved to a less stressful job, where he \nquickly established himself as a solid worker and a natural leader. His commander, an \nArmy captain, described him as one of the top performers in his command and \nrecommended him for promotion. (AX F.) \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder in \npartial remission. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) He received \u201cmaintenance therapy\u201d until December 2017. \n \nIn March 2018, Applicant was evaluated at a behavioral health clinic and \ndiagnosed with an adjustment disorder. A psychiatrist reported that he had \u201climited coping \nskills, persistent depression, and work-related stressors for which he has few coping \nskills.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.h) In January 2019, a psychiatrist diagnosed him with persistent \ndepressive disorder with work-related stress, few coping skills and adjustment disorder \nwith disturbance of emotions and conduct. (GX 4 at 2.) (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) \n \nIn February 2019, after Applicant returned to the United States, a psychologist \nevaluated him while was on terminal leave pending the results of a medical evaluation \nboard. In her report, the psychologist expressed concern about the accuracy of the tests \nthat she administered because she believed Applicant presented himself in an extremely \npositive light by denying many minor faults and shortcomings that most people \nacknowledge. However, she also noted that during the psychological interview that \u201che \nwas forthcoming and did not appear to be attempting to portray himself in a positive light.\u201d \n(GX 4 at 5.)  \n \nThe psychologist noted Applicant\u2019s history of suicidal ideation and threatening \nbehavior. She found significant thought dysfunction, based on persecutory ideation such \nas believing that others seek to harm him. She noted that Applicant believed that his \nnoncommissioned officer (NCO) followed him to make sure that he kept his medical \nappointments, that his NCO punished him without cause, that his NCO stole his work and \npresented it as his own, and that his NCO \u201ctalked trash\u201d about him. She also noted that \nApplicant made his own appointment in violation of normal protocol, after being told that \nthe evaluation could only be scheduled through his security officer, and she concluded \n\n \n4 \n \nthat his violation of the scheduling protocol evidenced an unwillingness to follow rules and \na disregard for instructions.  \n \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with dysthymic disorder, a form of \ndepression, but ruled out a personality disorder. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) She concluded that, based \non his history of high risk, irresponsible, aggressive, antisocial, or emotionally unstable \nbehavior, there may be a material deficit in his ability or willingness to properly safeguard \nclassified information or perform sensitive duties, especially if he was not happy with his \nassignment or believed he knew a better way to perform his duties. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) She \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s deficits or problems could impact his reliability or \ntrustworthiness and could cause unwillingness or resistance to follow rules and \nregulations. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \nThe psychologist apparently based her conclusion about Applicant\u2019s inability or \nunwillingness to follow rule and regulations solely on his failure to follow the protocol for \nscheduling a mental health evaluation. The record reflects no disciplinary or \nadministrative measures imposed on him during his military service for failure to obey \norders, follow instructions, or obey regulations.  \n \nThe psychologist found that Applicant\u2019s psychological functioning was stable and \nthat he did not report any significant symptoms of depression or anxiety at the time of her \nevaluation. She concluded that his social functioning and occupational functioning were \ngood. However, she also concluded that her interview of Applicant revealed deficits or \nproblems with judgment and revealed traits that could affect his reliability or \ntrustworthiness. She concluded from the psychological interview that his current \npsychiatric condition was stable, but that he likely has a chronic mood disorder that affects \nhis ability to cope with stressful situations.  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s record of seeking assistance from behavioral health \nprofessionals, the psychologist concluded that he likely will seek help again if he feels the \nneed. She noted that Applicant reported that he is compliant with his medications, but she \nexpressed concern that noncompliance might cause him to decompensate to his previous \nlevel of self-injury or threatening behaviors. Her prognosis was \u201cguarded\u201d because of \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cinability to adequately cope with his personal and professional stressors, \neven though he seeks help when he feels that he needs it.\u201d (GX 4 at 6-7.)  \n \nApplicant returned to the United States in early 2018. An Army staff sergeant who \nwas Applicant\u2019s supervisor from February 2018 to March 2019 observed that he provided \n\u201cimmaculate communications support\u201d to his unit and that he demonstrated exceptional \nleadership and decision-making and earned the trust of the command\u2019s senior leadership \nas well as his co-workers and immediate supervisor. (AX E.)  \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s discharge in March 2019, he sought medical treatment from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA). He testified that his headaches returned but that the \nVA medical personnel kept giving him intravenous injections and sending him home. (Tr. \n21.)  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAt some time in 2019, VA medical personnel discovered a mass growing in \nApplicant\u2019s brain. In December 29, 2019, Applicant underwent a CT scan and an MRI, to \ndetermine whether a pituitary mass growing in his brain was a pituitary adenoma (a slow-\ngrowing tumor on the pituitary gland). (AX A.) The MRI reflected a \u201csellar mass with \nsuprasellar extension and areas of internal high density which may represent hemorrhage \nand pituitary apoplexy. (AX L at 4.) He was admitted to a hospital immediately, with \nindications of \u201cpituitary apoplexy with pituitary adenoma.\u201d He underwent surgery, which \nfound hemorrhagic pituitary macro adenoma, and the pituitary mass was removed. He \nwas released from the hospital on January 2, 2020. (AX M; AX O at 18.) A follow-up MRI \nin March 2020 indicated that the surgery was successful and the mass was gone. (AX M; \nAX O at 5; Tr. 32.) Applicant testified that the doctors told him that mass was at least \nthree or four years old. (Tr. 31.)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant presented medical literature reflecting that pituitary \nadenomas can cause recurrent headaches, anxiety, decreased concentration, fatigue, \ndepression, and hormonal dysregulation that causes mood disorders. (AX C and D.) A \nmedical professional from the VA opined that Applicant\u2019s depression, anxiety, and anger \nwere likely exacerbated by a brain tumor. (AX G.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s treatment plan provides for annual CT scans for the next five years. \n(Tr. 47.) He is also being treated by an endocrinologist, because the pituitary gland \ndysfunction damaged his hormonal system. He testified that his headaches are less \nsevere, and he treats them with over-the-counter drugs instead of the stronger drugs that \nhe received previously. His mood is \u201chappier.\u201d (Tr. 32-33.) \n \n \nApplicant continues to receive treatment for his mental health. He takes \nPropranolol (an anti-anxiety drug) and Cymbalta (an antidepressant). He sees a \nbehavioral health professional from the VA once a month. (Tr. 37.) His VA provider states \nthat he has been compliant with his treatment. (AX G.) \n \n \nTwo co-workers who have observed Applicant during the past year attested to his \ntechnical skill, leadership skill, and his trustworthiness under pressure, which led to his \npromotion to a leadership position one month after beginning his current job,. One co-\nworker commented specifically on his communication skills and management style that \nmake customers and his team members feel important and valued. (AX I; AX J.)  \n \nAn Air Force senior master sergeant who is Applicant\u2019s government office manager \ndescribes him as motivated, hard-working, and skilled. He states: \u201cI have been impressed \nby his strong communication skills and his ability to establish a comfortable rapport with \nothers. He comes across as confident, mature, and highly capable to handle short notice \ntaskers. . . . \u201d (AX K.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n \n6 \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n\n \n7 \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \n \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s depression and behavioral problems appear \nto have been caused in large part by a hemorrhagic pituitary adenoma, which was \nremoved on December 29, 2019. He is taking medications for anxiety and depression, \nreceiving behavioral health counseling, and is compliant with his treatment program. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(b) is partially established. Applicant is voluntarily participating in a VA \ntreatment program, receiving counseling and medication, and is compliant with the \nprogram\u2019s requirements. He submitted evidence that his surgery was successful. \nHowever, he submitted no evidence of a prognosis regarding his mental health and \nbehavior.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is partially established. Applicant provided evidence that his pituitary \nadenoma has been resolved by surgery, but he did not provide any recent evidence from \na medical professional regarding his mental and behavioral health. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d) and AG \u00b6 20(e) are established. Applicant\u2019s surgery appears to have \nremoved the cause of his depression, anxiety, and threatening behavior. The testimonials \nfrom Applicant\u2019s current supervisor and two of his co-workers indicate that his behavioral \nproblems have not recurred since his surgery. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n9 \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline(s), but some \nwarrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant held a security clearance during his active duty, apparently without \nincident. His military record oscillated between periods of brilliant performance and \nperiods of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and threatening behavior. He was \ndiagnosed in February 2019 with depression, but not with a personality disorder. He also \nsuffers from fibromyalgia, a painful disease is sometimes accompanied by fluctuating \nmood swings.  \n \n \nApplicant began complaining about his headaches in February 2014, but it was not \nuntil December 2019, after his discharge from the Army, that the source of his pain and \nmood disorders was discovered and repaired. After a significant cause of his mood \nswings was removed, he appears to have established himself as a talented, effective, \nrespected, and well-liked IT professional in the civilian world. He is complying with his \nprogram of counseling and medication. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline I, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \npsychological conditions. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I, Psychological Conditions: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "full_text": "1 \n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \n______________ \n______________ \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n------------------- \n) \nISCR Case No. 19-02685 \n) \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government:  \nDavid F. Hayes, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: \nPro se \nMay 28, 2020 \nDecision \nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant had an alcohol-related arrest in 2018. After his conviction a bench \nwarrant was issued for failure to appear at a subsequent hearing. Applicant also falsified \na Government questionnaire on the same topic. Based on a review of the pleadings, and \nexhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 13, 2018. (Government Exhibit 2.) On November 5, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nJ (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). (Item 1.) The action was taken under \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nafter June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 2, 2019 (Answer One); and \nFebruary 5, 2020 (Answer Two). He requested his case be decided on the written record \nin lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.) On March 2, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the \nDepartment=s written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), \nconsisting of Items 1 to 7, was provided to Applicant, who received the file on March 18, \n2020. \n \n Department Counsel submitted seven Items in support of the SOR allegations. \nItem 3 is inadmissible. It is the summary of an unsworn interview of Applicant conducted \nby an interviewer from the Office of Personnel Management on February 20, 2019. \nApplicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement, or otherwise certify it to be \naccurate. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation (ROI) summary is \ninadmissible in the Government\u2019s case in chief in the absence of an authenticating \nwitness. (See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5.) In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 3 is \nalso cumulative. Applicant is not legally trained and might not have understood \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM commentary, which described the potential admissibility of \nItem 3. I therefor reviewed it for any potentially mitigating information that Applicant might \nhave thought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will be discussed later \nin this decision. \n \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit any additional \ninformation, or object to the admissibility of any contents of the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on May 12, 2020. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 51 and is separated from his wife. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and \nhas worked for his current employer since 2018. Applicant is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his work with the DoD. (Item 2 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because he has engaged in conduct of a criminal nature. Applicant \nadmitted both allegations in the SOR, with explanations. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on September 9, 2018, and was charged with Driving \nUnder the Influence of Alcohol, Driving with Blood Alcohol more than .08%, and \nTransportation of Liquor. Applicant stated in both of his Answers that he had started blood \npressure medication and it had reacted badly with alcohol he had been drinking. He pulled \nover into a gas station, where he passed out and was later awakened by a police officer.  \n \n \nPolice records state that Applicant showed obvious signs of intoxication when he \nwas approached by the police, and had an open can of beer in his car. At the police \nstation Applicant was given a breathalyzer test that showed a blood alcohol level of \n.146%, far above the .08% legal limit. He was cited for the three offenses mentioned in \nthe SOR. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant stated in his Answers, \u201cMy case was an ongoing situation at the time of \nthe DOD interview [February 20, 2019] that constituted a \u2018no\u2019 answer from me at that \ntime.\u201d This statement is incorrect. Court records show that Applicant personally appeared \nin court on November 29, 2018. He pleaded guilty to Driving with Blood Alcohol more than \n.08%. The other two charges were Nolle Prossed. He was sentenced to 24 months court \nsupervision, to pay a fine, attend ten hours of DUI risk education, and 20 hours of \nsubstance abuse education. His court supervision is due to end on November 30, 2020. \nThe court record does not show that Applicant completed any part of his sentence and a \nbench warrant was issued on March 16, 2019, for failure to appear. (Item 6.)  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his Answers that he moved and that his attorney told him that \nhe would not have to appear further. The record shows the court received a change of \naddress from the Applicant on November 30, 2018. Applicant indicated in Answer One, \nand again two months later in Answer Two, that he would be following up with his attorney \nto resolve the matter. There is no evidence that he did so. (Item 6.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Appellant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he falsified material facts during the clearance screening process. \n \n \nApplicant filled out his e-QIP on December 13, 2018. Section 22 of the e-QIP \nasked, \u201cHave you EVER been charged with an offense related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d \n(Emphasis in original.) Applicant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d This was a false answer to a relevant \nquestion about Applicant\u2019s criminal history. (Item 2.)  \n \n \nIn Answer Two Applicant basically stated that he could not admit or deny this \nallegation because it had not been \u201cverified.\u201d He went on to say that his case was an \nongoing situation and he could not answer yes or no.  \n \n \nThis explanation is rejected for two reasons. First, Applicant\u2019s explanation is not \nreasonable. The question is not subject to misinterpretation. He was arrested, charged, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nand convicted of Driving with Blood Alcohol more than .08% two weeks before filling out \nthe e-QIP.  \n \n \nSecond, Applicant also falsified the e-QIP when he answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to two other \nquestions under Section 22. Specifically, Applicant was asked whether he had been \narrested within the past seven years. He was also asked whether he had been charged, \nconvicted or sentenced of a crime in any court in the past seven years. While these \nfalsifications cannot be used as disqualifying matters in the case in chief because they \nwere not alleged in the SOR, I find that his conduct evidences an intent to deceive with \nrespect to the alleged falsification, and greatly weakens the credibility of his explanation.  \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions apply: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and  \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant had an alcohol-related criminal incident in September 2018. He is \ncurrently under court supervision until at least November 2020 for this conviction. He \nsubmitted no evidence showing that he had completed any of the terms of his sentence. \nIn addition, there is a bench warrant for his arrest for failure to attend a required post-\nconviction court appearance. No evidence was submitted that the warrant has been \ncleared. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant was seriously intoxicated when he was arrested. He has not submitted \nevidence showing that he has completed any of his sentence. Of particular concern is the \nfact that he is still under court supervision and there is an outstanding bench warrant. \nThere is insufficient evidence to make a positive decision in Applicant\u2019s favor. Guideline \nJ is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E: Personal Conduct) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant knowingly falsified his e-QIP personnel security questionnaire \nconcerning his criminal conduct. He did this, moreover, only two weeks after pleading \nguilty to the relevant charge in court. \n \n \nThe following conditions are not mitigating under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide a coherent, believable excuse for his denial of and failure \nto disclose his DUI arrest and conviction as required. The evidence establishes that \nApplicant deliberately falsified, omitted and concealed this relevant information. Guideline \nE is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity significance of his criminal conduct and related falsification of a government \nquestionnaire on the same topic. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt \nas to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Schachter, Esq. \n03/24/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines M (Use of \nInformation Technology) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 26, 2018. On \nNovember 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines M and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 13, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n\n2 \n \n22, 2020, and the case was assigned to me on January 23, 2020. On February 3, 2020, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing \nwas scheduled for February 19, 2020. Applicant retained an attorney, who requested that \nthe hearing be postponed until at least March 2, 2020. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I at 3-4.) On \nFebruary 18, 2020, I granted the request for postponement. (HX II.) On February 28, \n2020, DOHA notified Applicant and his attorney that the hearing was rescheduled for \nMarch 9, 2020. On the same day, I issued a case management order requiring the parties \nto submit their witness lists and exhibits to me not later than February 18, 2020. (HX III.) \nBoth parties complied with the order. (HX IV.) I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \nApplicant waived the 15-day notice requirement in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. (Tr. 7.) \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence. GX 2 was admitted \nover Applicant\u2019s objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of three witnesses, \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A-1, A-2 and B, which were admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until March 16, 2020, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted AX C, which was admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 17, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary and Procedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant objected to GX 2, a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) incident \nreport on the grounds that it is an adverse statement by a witness who is not available for \ncross-examination, that it is not an official government record, and that it is not a record \nprepared by Applicant\u2019s former employer in the ordinary course of business. Department \nCounsel argued that the document was admissible as a document prepared in the regular \ncourse of business under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection on the \nground that the JPAS incident report was prepared in the regular course of business by \na defense contractor who had an obligation to report an incident that might affect the \nsecurity eligibility of a cleared employee. (Tr. 18-23.) See NISPOM DoD 5220.22-M, \nSection 3, \u00b6 1-302.a (\u201cContractors shall report adverse information coming to their \nattention concerning any of their cleared employees.\u201d). See also ISCR Case No. 15-\n02859 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017.) (Police report containing hearsay admissible both as an \nofficial record under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and as a public record under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 803(8)).  \n \nI also acknowledged that the weight of the JPAS incident report was lessened by \nmultiple layers of hearsay and inability to question the source of the information. (Tr. 23.) \nIn this case, the admissibility of the JPAS incident report is mooted by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, which were incorporated in my \nfindings of fact set out below.  \n \n \nBefore the hearing, Applicant requested that Department Counsel produce \ndocumentary evidence of the policy of Applicant\u2019s former employer forbidding the use of \nthumb drives to transfer information to or among company computers. (HX I at 4.) At the \nhearing, Department Counsel stated that she had no documentary evidence of the policy \nand had not requested it from Applicant\u2019s former employer. (Tr. 24-25.) The Directive \u00b6 \n\n3 \n \nE3.1.11 limits discovery by an applicant to \u201cnon-privileged documents and materials \nsubject to control by the DOHA.\u201d If the policy was set out in a document, the document \nwas not subject to control by the DOHA. Applicant and his witnesses at the hearing \ntestified that they had not seen documentary evidence of the policy, but that they were \ninformed during training that the use of thumb drives was prohibited. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions moot the issue, because he admitted that he knew that the use of thumb \ndrives was prohibited. His admissions were incorporated in my findings of fact set out \nbelow. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s request for postponement of the hearing, he asserted that he did not \nhave a complete copy of Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I at 4.) \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel asserted that she had provided a complete copy of \nApplicant\u2019s answer to Applicant\u2019s attorney, who conceded that she may have done so. I \nrecessed the hearing to allow Applicant\u2019s attorney to examine my copy of Applicant\u2019s \nanswer and Department Counsel\u2019s copy. After the recess, Applicant\u2019s attorney was \nsatisfied that he had a complete copy of Applicant\u2019s answer.  \n(Tr. 8-11.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. At the hearing, \nhis attorney moved to withdraw his answer to the SOR and substitute a modified answer \nto the SOR. (HX V.) I denied the motion to withdraw his answer to the SOR on the ground \nthat there is no authority under the Directive permitting an applicant to withdraw an answer \nto the SOR. However, I granted Applicant\u2019s motion to the extent that I allowed him to \nsubmit explanations for his answer to the SOR. (Tr. 13-17.) His admissions in his original \nanswer to the SOR, his modified answer in HX V, and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old cyber-security analyst employed by a defense contractor \nsince March 2018. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1986. He was an employee of \nanother government agency for about five years. (Tr. 37.) He was employed by another \ndefense contractor from July 2003 to March 2018, when he was terminated for the \nconduct alleged in the SOR. He married in May 1998 and has five children, ages 20, 19, \n18, 15, and 14. He has held a security clearance since about 1999. (Tr. 70.) \n \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant sent an email to a co-worker, asking her to allow \nhim to use her security token to gain access to an unclassified server in order to perform \nsystem software patching and troubleshooting. The security token is a small piece of \nhardware with a USB plug on the end. (Tr. 86.) His security token had been recently \nreissued and could not be read by the server. The compliance date for updating the \nsystem was approaching, and the system would be taken offline if he could not complete \nthe updates. (Tr. 58.) His co-worker declined, telling him that she would be uncomfortable \nallowing him to use her security token. His former employer\u2019s security team intercepted \ntheir email exchange. Applicant testified that he was given an alternate method of \nbypassing the token requirement, but it did not work. (Tr. 56-57.) He testified that he did \n\n4 \n \nnot ask his co-worker to install the security updates because she did not have the skill set \nrequired to install them. (Tr. 68.) He knew, based on training and the provisions of the \nnon-disclosure agreement that he signed, that employees were not allowed to share \ncredentials. (Tr. 71.) \n \nBased on an internal investigation by the corporate counsel and facility security \nofficer in January and February 2018, Applicant was terminated on March 2, 2018. (GX \n2.) When Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in March 2018, he disclosed his \ntermination and the attempt to use another employee\u2019s security token. (GX 1 at 15.)  \n \nApplicant testified that he had submitted multiple requests for almost a month to \ninstall a device driver that could read his new security token. (Tr. 41.) In the meantime, \nhe was unable to install the patches and security updates necessary to protect the system \nfrom being hacked. (Tr. 44-45.) He testified that in hindsight he should have escalated his \nproblem with his security token to his supervisors. (Tr. 47.) He testified that during the \ninvestigation the corporate counsel asked him if he would try to use someone else\u2019s \nsecurity token again, and he said that he would \u201cif it would get the job done.\u201d When \nreminded by the corporate counsel that he had signed a non-disclosure agreement \nprohibiting sharing of credentials, he responded, \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d (Tr. 64.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that, in February 2018, the corporate counsel told him that they \nhad observed his use of a personal thumb drive in September 2017 to transfer work-\nrelated data between his employer\u2019s unclassified information systems. (Tr. 60.) At the \nhearing, he admitted that he started using a thumb drive in April 2017, when his \nemployer\u2019s system was migrated into a government system. He was having problems \nwith downloading software updates and security patches. He knew how to clean a thumb \ndrive to prevent transmitting malware. He did not connect the thumb drive to a government \nnetwork. He used the thumb drive to transfer data from his contractor\u2019s laptop to his \ngovernment laptop on four occasions, in April, July, September, and November 2017. (Tr. \n47-49.) He testified that the SOR was inaccurate when it alleged that he used the thumb \ndrive beginning in July 2003. The basis for alleging that Applicant used the thumb drive \nfrom July 2003 to March 2018 is not in the record. The inclusive dates of Applicant\u2019s \nunauthorized use of a thumb drive are not reflected in the JPAS incident report. He \ntestified that when he answered the SOR, he stated that he admitted that he used the \nthumb drive between July 2003 and March 2018 because those were the dates of his \nemployment by his former employer. He testified that he did not know that he could admit \npart of the allegation and deny part of it. (Tr. 50.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has never seen a document forbidding the use of thumb \ndrives. However, he admitted that during training he was clearly told that he should not \nuse thumb drives. (Tr. 52, 62.) However, he believed that the permissible devices such \nas compact discs were the same as using a thumb drive and just as safe because he \nknew how to \u201cnuke\u201d the thumb drive and remove any potential contamination. (Tr. 52-54.) \n \nThe JPAS incident report (GX 2) recited that Applicant was cautioned against using \nthe thumb drive and instructed to not use it again, and that \u201che replied that he could not \n\n5 \n \nguarantee he would not do it again if he needed to accomplish his mission.\u201d Applicant \ndenied telling the investigators that he could not guarantee that he would not use a thumb \ndrive again. (Tr. 63-64.) He testified that he told the contractor\u2019s counsel that he would \nnot use a thumb drive again but that he was uncomfortable leaving the system insecure. \n(Tr. 64.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of a thumb drive and his attempt to use a co-worker\u2019s security \ntoken occurred only on unclassified systems. He testified that a classified system is totally \ndifferent with very stringent rules. (Tr. 68.) He would never bypass security rules on a \nclassified system for efficiency. He believes that the rules for classified systems are about \nsecurity, not efficiency. (Tr. 65-66.) \n \n \nThe co-worker who declined Applicant\u2019s request to use her security token testified \non his behalf. She has worked for Applicant\u2019s former employer as a software engineer \nsince May 2007. She regards Applicant as very responsible, reliable, honest, and \ntrustworthy. (Tr. 76-80.) She testified that Applicant\u2019s token had expired, and that she \ndeclined Applicant\u2019s request to use her token, telling him that she did not feel comfortable \nallowing him to use it and did not want to get their employer in trouble. She did not report \nhis request. Her opinion of Applicant did not change as a result of his request. (Tr. 82, \n86.) \n \n \nAnother former co-worker who had worked with Applicant on a project for about \neight years testified that she believes he is a trustworthy, reliable, and honest person. \nShe testified that their employer allowed the use of thumb drives about ten years ago, but \nthe policy changed with the technology and everyone was notified by bulletins and emails \nof the change. She testified that she believes Applicant knows that he made a mistake \nand that he wants to do the right thing. (Tr. 90-96.) \n \n \nA current co-worker has known Applicant for about four years and works with him \non the same project. He considers Applicant to have good judgment and believes he is \nvery reliable, trustworthy, and honest. He is aware of the reasons Applicant was \nterminated by his previous employer, but believes Applicant had no malicious intent, but \n\u201cat the end of the day, he was just trying to get the job done.\u201d (Tr. 98-103.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n\n6 \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that in about September 2017, Applicant attempted to gain \naccess to an information technology system by using another employee\u2019s security token \n\n7 \n \nin violation of \u201ccompany business ethics and operations standards\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also \nalleges that between about July 2003 and March 2018, Applicant regularly used an \nunauthorized personal USB storage device to move work-related data to and from \nunclassified information systems in violation of \u201ccompany business ethics and operations \nstandards\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \n \n \nThe concern under this Guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39:  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 40(a): unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n \nAG \u00b6 40(f): introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, \nsoftware, or media to or from any information technology system when \nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when \notherwise not authorized; and \n \nAG \u00b6 40(g): negligence or lax security practices in handling information \ntechnology that persists despite counseling by management. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40(a) is applicable but not fully established. Applicant attempted to gain entry \ninto his employer\u2019s information technology system, but he was unsuccessful because his \nco-worker would not allow him to use her security token. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40(f) is established. Applicant introduced an unauthorized personal thumb \ndrive into his employer\u2019s information technology system. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40(g) is not established. There is no evidence that Applicant was counseled \nabout sharing security tokens or using a thumb drive. He testified that the corporate \ncounsel told him that he had been observed using a thumb drive in September 2017, but \nthere is no evidence that he was admonished or counseled until he was interviewed by \nthe corporate counsel in February 2018. \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 41(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 41(b): the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of \norganizational efficiency and effectiveness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 41(d): the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s infractions occurred more than two years \nago and have not recurred in his current job. He has acknowledged his bad judgment and \nhas suffered severe consequences for his infractions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41(b) is established. Both incidents involved minor infractions in the use of \nan unclassified system. Applicant\u2019s request to use a co-worker\u2019s security token was \nrebuffed and he did not pursue it. The use of a thumb drive previously had been permitted, \nbut the company policy had changed. Applicant\u2019s sole motivation in both incidents was \norganizational efficiency and effectiveness. He made it clear during his testimony that he \nwould have acted differently in a classified system. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41(d) is not established. Applicant admitted in his answer to the SOR, his \namended answer to the SOR, and his testimony at the hearing that he knew from his \ntraining that sharing of credentials and use of thumb drives were prohibited. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under this \nguideline (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n\n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 16(f): violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established by Applicant\u2019s repeated violations of the rules for use of \nhis employer\u2019s information technology system. AG \u00b6 16(f) is established by his repeated \nviolation of the conditions he agreed to in his non-disclosure agreement. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nGuideline M. AG \u00b6 17(d) is partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his \nbehavior. There is no evidence of counseling or \u201cother positive steps\u201d taken by Applicant, \nbut his behavior is unlikely to recur, for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nGuideline M. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines M and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the \nhearing. He was not particularly remorseful. Instead, he conveyed the impression that he \n\n10 \n \nthought his conduct was justified, but he also made it clear that he will not jeopardize his \ncareer by further violations. He has worked as a federal employee and a defense \ncontractor for over 20 years and held a security clearance for more than 16 years. He is \nhighly respected for his reliability. His infractions were motivated by a misguided decision \nto ignore less efficient rules in order to support his employer more efficiently. He has paid \ndearly for his disregard for security rules and appears to have learned his lesson. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines M and E, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by violation of the rules for protecting information \ntechnology. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, seven of the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.g., 1.h., 1.k., 1.m., and 1.n.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a security officer with her current employer since October 2018. She had previous experience with another employer as both a security guard and an office coordinator from July 2014 until February 2018. She is a 1980 high school graduate. She has never served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance. She was married in 1986 and divorced in 1997. She has two adult children, born in 1983 and 1988.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 28, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued her a set \nof Interrogatories. She responded to those Interrogatories with attached documents on \nAugust 6, 2019. On October 29, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nOn November 29, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she elected to have \nher case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy of \nthe Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on January 28, 2020, and she was \nafforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. \nApplicant received the FORM on February 7, 2020. Her response was due on March 8, \n2020. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of May 12, 2020, no response \nhas been received. The case was assigned to me on May 12, 2020. The record closed \non March 8, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, seven of the \nSOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.g., 1.h., 1.k., 1.m., and 1.n.). Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand accompanying comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a security officer with her current employer since October 2018. She had previous \nexperience with another employer as both a security guard and an office coordinator from \nJuly 2014 until February 2018. She is a 1980 high school graduate. She has never served \nwith the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance. She was married in 1986 \nand divorced in 1997. She has two adult children, born in 1983 and 1988.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated November 29, 2018); Item 3 (SF 86, dated October 28, \n2018); Item 4 (Responses to Interrogatories, dated August 6, 2019); Item 7 (Enhanced \nSubject Interview, dated January 10, 2019); Item 7 (Subject Contact, dated January 29, \n2019); Item 7 (Subject Contact, dated February 25, 2019); and Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s \nAnswers to SOR, dated November 29, 2019).  \n \nApplicant reported that her financial issues arose because of a combination of two \nfactors during the period 2016 through 2018: low-paying jobs and unemployment \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n(February 2018 \u2013 October 2018), or as she commented, she was down on her luck and \nunemployed. (Item 7, at 7; Item 2, at 3) In addition, because she did not have enough \nmoney to pay someone to file her federal and state income tax returns for a multiple tax \nyear period, or to actually pay her income taxes, she did not timely file them or pay any \nincome taxes. (Item 7, at 5, 7) While she was unemployed, she received unemployment \ncompensation, and she was supported by one of her sons. (Item 7, at 4) A review of her \n2018 credit report reveals that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties actually predated the period \nthat she identified, for she actually had several accounts that became delinquent during \nthe period 2012 \u2013 2014 (Item 6, at 6, 11-12). It is noted that in her SF 86, Applicant \nreported that in June 2018, during her financial struggles with unemployment, she \nmanaged to take a six-to-ten day tourism visit to two Caribbean Islands. (Item 3, at 25-\n26)  \nIn her October 2018 SF 86, Applicant listed having only one financial issue \nassociated with her federal income taxes, claiming that it commenced in August 2017, \nand it was related to her unemployment. She estimated that she owed $6,522 in federal \nincome taxes, but she also contended that she was on a payment plan, and she was \nmaking monthly payments. She denied having any other delinquent accounts. (Item 3, at \n33-34) On January 10, 2019, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant did not initially identify or discuss any other \ndelinquent accounts until she was confronted by the investigator with information \nassociated with additional delinquent accounts. She indicated that she did not list them in \nher SF 86 because she was unaware of them. (Item 7, at 5-7) Following that interview, \nApplicant reported that she had obtained a credit report and learned about some of her \ndelinquent accounts. She subsequently furnished the OPM investigator with payment \nagreements related to two delinquent accounts. (Attachments to Item 7)  \nIn August 2019, in response to the Interrogatories, Applicant reported that she was \nworking with a specific national law firm \u201cto mitigate and remove false or incorrect and \nnegative reports on [her] credit. The accounts in question are making [her] (sic) credit \nscores low. [She] expects these accounts and all subsequent debts to be removed from \n[her] reports within the next 60 to 90 days.\u201d (Item 4, at 2) She failed to submit any \ndocuments related to her reported association with the law firm, their purported efforts on \nher behalf, or any results of any of those efforts. \nIn addition to the allegations related to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and \nstate income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, the SOR alleged \n12 delinquent accounts, including unpaid federal and state income taxes, totaling \napproximately $26,468. Although she claimed that she had entered into repayment plans \nwith some of her creditors, or that she was making payments to certain creditors, with the \nexception of two documents which reflected agreed repayment plans, Applicant failed to \nsubmit any documentation, such as receipts, cancelled checks, or bank account \nstatements, to support her positions that payments had been made to any creditors or \nthat she had complied with any of the expected requirements of the reported repayment \nplans.  \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s admitted failure to timely file her federal and state \nincome tax returns, the SOR allegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. alleges that the federal income tax return for the tax years 2015, 2016, \nand 2017 were not timely filed, as required. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued \naccount transcripts, dated July 16, 2019, that indicated that the tax returns were not filed \nuntil May 7, 2018, and Applicant was penalized for her failures; \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. also alleges that the federal income tax return for the tax year 2018 \nwas not timely filed, as required. The IRS issued a letter of verification of non-filing, dated \nJuly 30, 2019, that indicated that the tax return was not yet filed; and \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. alleges that the state income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, \n2017, and 2018 were not timely filed, as required, and Applicant offered no evidence that \nshe had yet filed those state income tax returns. \nWith respect to those delinquent accounts for which Applicant claimed that she \nhad repayment plans in place or that she was making payments to certain creditors, the \nSOR allegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. alleges that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for \ndelinquent taxes in the amount of $4,237 for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. In her \n2018 SF 86, she claimed she \u201cwas making monthly payments,\u201d but failed to specify how \nmuch was being paid or when those payments supposedly commenced. (Item 3, at 33) \nDuring her January 2019 OPM interview, she claimed that she was currently paying \n$25.46 per month \u201cto each account,\u201d but she failed to specify whether she meant federal \nversus state or to the IRS for each delinquent year. (Item 7, at 5) In her Answer to the \nSOR, she claimed that she made an arrangement to pay $53 per month. (Item 2, at 3) \nNone of the documents presented from the IRS indicate any installment agreements \nhaving been established or any payments having been received. Because Applicant failed \nto submit any documentary evidence of installment agreements or payments, there are \nonly her unverified contentions that any positive efforts have been made; \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. alleges that Applicant is indebted to the state for delinquent taxes in \nthe amount of $790. During her January 2019 OPM interview, she acknowledged that the \ndelinquent balance was $790, but in her Answer to the SOR, she stated the amount was \nonly $279, and claimed that she had made an arrangement to make monthly payments \nof $45. Because she failed to submit any documentary evidence of an installment \nagreement or payments, there are only her unverified contentions that any positive efforts \nhave been made; \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. is a time-share account with an unpaid balance of approximately $514 \nthat was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. Applicant initially claimed to \nbe unaware of the account, but subsequently disputed responsibility for the account \nbecause her ex-boyfriend \u2013 the purported co-signer on the account \u2013 had declared \nbankruptcy. (Item 7, at 6; Item 2, at 4) In January 2019, she agreed to a repayment plan \nunder which she was to start making $35 payments, with the first such payment due on \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nJanuary 31, 2019. (Letter, dated January 31, 2019, attached to Item 7) She failed to \nsubmit any evidence that she had actually made any payments; \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of approximately $391 \nthat was placed for collection. In December 2018, the collection agent offered her a \ndiscount if she would start making payments on the account, and the following month she \nagreed to a repayment plan under which she was to make a $25 payment on January 31, \n2019, to be following by monthly payments of approximately $61 through July 2019. \n(Letters dated December 19, 2018, and January 31, 2019, attached to Item 7) She failed \nto submit any evidence that she had actually made any such payments. \nWith respect to those delinquent accounts for which Applicant did not claim that \nshe had repayment plans in place or that she was making payments to any creditors, the \nSOR allegations are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $5,546 that was placed \nfor collection (Item 6, at 6); SOR \u00b6 1.f. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid \nbalance of $2,337 that was placed for collection and charged off (Item 6, at 6; Item 7, at \n7); SOR \u00b6 1.g. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $32 that was placed for \ncollection (Item 6, at 6; Item 7, at 7); SOR \u00b6 1.h. is an unspecified type of account with an \nunpaid balance of $11,770, of which $881 was past due that was placed for collection  \n(Item 6, at 8); SOR \u00b6 1.j. is a cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of $404 \nthat was placed for collection (Item 6, at 11); SOR \u00b6 1.l. is a cellular-telephone account \nwith an unpaid balance of $296 that was placed for collection (Item 6, at 11); and SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.m. and 1.n. are medical accounts with unpaid balances of $81 and $70 that were \nplaced for collection (Item 6, at 12).  \nThe IRS account transcripts reflect the following adjusted gross incomes for the \nyears in question: $31,376 (2015); $28,106 (2016); and $29,861 (2017). (Attachments to \nItem 4) It is not known what Applicant\u2019s 2018 or 2019 adjusted gross income was, or what \ncurrent financial resources may be because she did not report her current net monthly \nincome; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available for \ndiscretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence \nof financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial information, it remains \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than she had \nbeen.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntaxes or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \nIn addition to the allegations related to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and \nstate income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, the SOR alleged \n12 delinquent accounts, including unpaid federal and state income taxes, totaling \napproximately $26,468. By the time the record closed, there was documentary evidence \nthat the federal income tax returns for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 were \neventually, but not timely, filed. The federal income tax return for 2018 has not yet been \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nfiled. Moreover, there is no evidence that the state income tax returns for 2015, 2016, \n2017, and 2018 have yet been filed. Furthermore, none of the delinquent accounts have \nbeen verifiably addressed by Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been \nestablished, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy her debts \nregardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. As noted \nabove, Applicant essentially attributed her financial difficulties to a combination of two \nfactors during the period 2016 through 2018: low-paying jobs and unemployment \n(February 2018 \u2013 October 2018), or as she commented, she was down on her luck and \nunemployed. A review of her credit report reveals that Applicant simply stopped making \nsome payments during 2012 - 2014, and others following each year thereafter, resulting \nin her accounts being placed for collection, charged off, and sometimes transferred or \nsold. As of the date the record closed on March 8, 2020, she had verifiably addressed not \na single delinquent account. As for her failure to timely file her income tax returns, her \nreason was that she did not have enough money to pay someone to file her income tax \nreturn for multiple tax years, or to actually pay her income taxes. She did, however, have \nsufficient time and money to visit two Caribbean Islands during her period of \nunemployment. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).  \n \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve her delinquent accounts for several years, \ncause me to conclude that her financial difficulties were not infrequent and they are likely \nto remain unchanged. Applicant completed her SF 86 in October 2018; underwent her \nOPM interview or subject contacts in January and February 2019; and the SOR was \nissued in October 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process placed her \non notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting her. In her Answer to the \nSOR, she claimed that she had entered into repayment arrangements with some of her \ncreditors, and that the remaining ones were in the repayment process with payments \nbeing made. She failed to submit documentary evidence to show that she was in \ncompliance with any of those arrangements. Although she could have indicated some \npositive action in response to the FORM, especially when the Department Counsel noted \nthat she had the opportunity to submit documentation, she failed to do so.  \n \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to ignore her \ndelinquent accounts even after she was interviewed by OPM. She failed to submit any \ndocumentary evidence to verify her contentions of positive resolution efforts taken \nfollowing her OPM interview. An applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only \nafter being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be \nlacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or \nwhen there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. \n18, 2018)). In this instance, there have been promises, but no verifiable action following \nthose promises. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n \nIn the absence of any verifiable positive activity by Applicant, of financial \ncounseling, and a budget, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a \nbetter position financially than she had been. Her actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. She \nis a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a security \nofficer with her current employer since October 2018. She had previous experience with \nanother employer as both a security guard and an office coordinator from July 2014 until \nFebruary 2018. She is a 1980 high school graduate. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. In addition to her failures to timely file her federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, Applicant had 12 delinquent \naccounts, including unpaid federal income taxes, totaling approximately $26,468, as \nalleged in the SOR. As of the date the record closed, she had not verifiably resolved any \nof those delinquent accounts, and she failed to provide documentary proof regarding her \npurported installment agreements with any of her creditors. She made unfulfilled promises \nto address her debts, but she failed to do so, even with those having relatively modest \nbalances of $32, $70, or $81. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s verifiable current track record is poor, at best. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 26, 2018, seeking eligibility for a public trust position. On January 6, \n2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F. The CAF acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for \nall adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nThe record does not reflect when Applicant received the SOR. He answered it on \nFebruary 1, 2020, and requested a decision on the written record without a hearing. He \nattached a bank statement dated February 1, 2020, to his answer, which I marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \non March 31, 2020, and sent a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) to \n\n2 \n \nApplicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He responded to the FORM on June \n28, 2020, and submitted a written statement and ten documents marked as Items A \nthrough J. I relabeled his ten documents as AX B through K. All of Applicant\u2019s documents \nand the Government\u2019s documents were admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on July 21, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations and explained \nwhat actions he was taking to resolve the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His \nadmissions and explanations are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old and is seeking employment by a federal contractor in a \npublic trust position. He was self-employed as a construction worker from August 2006 to \nSeptember 2009 and has been self-employed as a home-repair service provider from \nJanuary 2018 to the present. He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant married in April 1987 and separated in March 2013. In his answer to the \nSOR, he referred to an \u201congoing divorce.\u201d He has a 32-year-old daughter and a 30-year-\nold son. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $34,325. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from December 2018 (FORM Item 4), July 2019 (FORM Item \n5), and March 2020 (Form Item 6). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized \nbelow. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: mortgage loan past due for $2,225. Applicant obtained a mortgage \nloan in July 2005. His loan was transferred to another lender and modified in March 2011. \n(FORM Item 4 at 2-3.) A credit report from July 2019 reflected that his payments were \npast due for $2,225. (FORM Item 5 at 1.) In Applicant\u2019s answer, he stated that he was \npaying $100 per month on this debt. It is not clear from his answer whether he was paying \n$100 per month on the first mortgage or the second mortgage on his home. In his \nresponse to the FORM, he provided evidence that the debt alleged in the SOR was paid \nin full in November 2019. (AX B.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $13,407. Applicant opened this \naccount in December 2005, and it was charged off in December 2015. (FORM Item 6 at \n1.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had begun making monthly $100 payments \non this debt. His bank statement reflected a $100 payment on January 21, 2020. (AX A \nat 5.) In his response to the FORM, he again stated that he was paying $100 per month \non this debt, and he attached documentation that he had authorized a one-time payment \nof $200 by direct debit from his checking account on June 26, 2020. (AX C.) It is not clear \nwhy he documented a $200 payment in connection with a payment plan calling for $100. \nHe did not submit documentation of any payments between January and June 2020. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: home-improvement store account referred for collection of \n$7,565. This debt first became delinquent in February 2015. The first \u201cmajor delinquency\u201d \nwas in July 2017. (FORM Item 6 at 2.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that \nhe was making monthly $100 payments on this debt. His response to the FORM included \ndocumentation that he had made a payment agreement with the collection agency in \nOctober 2019, providing for monthly payments of $100.07 for 74 months, and that he had \nmade nine monthly payments as of June 2020. (AX D.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: department-store charge account referred for collection of $4,174. \nThis debt first became delinquent in November 2014, and the first \u201cmajor delinquency\u201d \nwas in August 2016. Applicant\u2019s bank statement reflected a $99.36 payment on January \n9, 2020. (AX A at 7.) His response to the FORM included documentation that he had \nmade a payment agreement with the collection agency in October 2019 providing for 41 \nmonthly payments of $99.36 by direct debit from his checking account and that he had \nmade 11 of the agreed monthly payments. (AX E.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit-card account charged off for $3,403. Applicant opened this \naccount in March 2000, and it was charged off in May 2016. In his answer, he stated that \nhe was making monthly $100 payments to a collection attorney. His bank statement \nreflected a $100 payment on January 21, 2020. (AX A at 5.) In his response to the FORM, \nhe stated that he was paying $100 per month and had reduced his balance to $2,903. He \nsubmitted documentation of a $200 payment on June 26, 2020. (AX F.) He did not submit \ndocumentation of any payments between January and June 2020.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: credit-card account charged off for $1,627.

In his answer to the SOR, he stated that the three bills were being handled by \nan attorney and that they were paid in full with a single payment of $515.39. Applicant\u2019s \nbank statement reflects a payment of $515.39 on January 23, 2020. (AX A at 3.) His \nresponse to the FORM includes documentation that all three bills were paid in full on \nJanuary 22, 2020. (AX I, J, and K.) \n\n4 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he attributed his delinquent debts to his ongoing \ndivorce and lack of employment. He provided no information about the date on which the \ndivorce proceedings began or the expenses he had incurred regarding them. He provided \nno information about his dates of unemployment. He provided no specific information \nabout his income and expenses, and no evidence of financial counseling. His bank \nstatement reflected that he had $299.73 in his checking account as of January 8, 2020, \nand $1,593.18 as of January 31, 2020. (AX A.) In his cover letter for his response to the \nFORM, he stated, \u201cI am trying to be debt free in about 20 months.\u201d \n \nPolicies \n \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4 \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt must be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marital breakup and lack of employment \nwere conditions beyond his control. However, he presented no evidence showing that \nthey predated and were a substantial cause of his delinquent debts. He submitted no \n\n6 \n \nevidence showing the circumstances in which the medical debts were incurred. He \nprovided no information about the dates and duration of his periods of unemployment. \nEven if some of these circumstances predated and contributed to his delinquencies, he \ndid not act responsibly. He made payment agreements for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d in October 2019, and he resolved the delinquent mortgage debt in November \n2019, but he did not begin making payments on any of the other debts until after the SOR \nwas issued on January 6, 2020. He made payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.d on January 9, 2020, only three days after the SOR was issued, and it is not clear \nwhether he had received the SOR when he made these payments. However, he did not \nmake payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.j until well after he SOR was issued \nand shortly before he answered it. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by \npayment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a public trust position. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, which \nApplicant resolved before he received the SOR. It is also established for the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, for which Applicant made payment agreements \nbefore receiving the SOR. It is not established for the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.e-1.j. He submitted documentary evidence of only two payments, in January \nand June 2020, on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f and only one payment \nin January 2020 on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He paid the medical debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j in January 2020. Most of his debt payments on the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b and 1.e-1.j were made after the SOR was issued. Payment in response to the \npressure of qualifying for a public trust position does not constitute \u201cgood faith\u201d within the \nmeaning of this mitigating condition. \n \n \nA public trust adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. \nBd. Jun. 21, 2010.) The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make \npayments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, \nor establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a \nplan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant is carrying out a \npayment plan to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, and he has resolved the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h-1.j. He has made intermittent payments on the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g. However, the mitigating impact of his actions to resolve his delinquent \ndebts is undermined by the fact that he did not begin to make payments on the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.e-1.j until he realized that his delinquent debts were an \nimpediment to obtaining a public trust position. Because of the minimal information he \nhas provided about his current income and expenses, I am not convinced that he has the \nfinancial resources to carry out his declared intention to make monthly $100 payments on \nall the unresolved debts, nor am I convinced that he will continue his efforts once the \npressure of qualifying for a public trust position is removed.  \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). He provided no information about his current financial situation, making \nit impossible to determine whether he will be able to carry out his stated plan of making \nmonthly payments on the unresolved debts.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations. While he \nhas made some progress in resolving in delinquent debts, he has not yet established a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. Once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a public trust position, there is a strong presumption against granting \neligibility. See ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). I am \nobligated by AG \u00b6 2(b) to resolve any doubt about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust \nposition in favor of national security. I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.e-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 13, 2019, Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling $24,646 on eight accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h). Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his February 13, 2019 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (or security clearance application (SCA)) by responding negatively to inquiries concerning whether he had any debts turned over for collection in the last seven years and whether he had any accounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted each of the debts but indicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h had been paid. He answered \u201cI admit\u201d regarding the negative responses to the financial inquiries on his SCA, but he then described it as \u201csimply a mistake on [his] part,\u201d and added that he \u201cwas not trying to hide anything.\u201d (GE 2.) Applicant\u2019s admissions to the debts are accepted as findings of fact. His response to SOR \u00b6 2.a is seen as an admission to having responded negatively to the inquiries but without intention to falsify.

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/30/2020 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not present sufficient information to fully mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his delinquent debts, including a $17,614 charged-off loan debt that is not \nresolved. He falsified his February 2019 security clearance application by denying that he \nowed any delinquent debts. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 13, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and \nGuideline E, personal conduct. The SOR explained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find \nit clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n\n2 \n \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \n \nOn January 17, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On February 27, 2020, the Government submitted a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), including five items consisting of its documentary \nevidence. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on March 3, 2020, and \ninstructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the \nFORM on March 9, 2020, and he submitted a timely response to the FORM that was \nreceived by DOHA on March 20, 2020. On March 23, 2020, the Government indicated it \nhad no objection to his response.  \n \nOn May 26, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. I received the case file on June 8, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 to the FORM a summary report of a \ntriggered enhanced personal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on May 2, \n2019. The summary report was included in the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in \nApplicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may \nbe received in evidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is \notherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not \nbear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) is being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to the FORM, you can comment on whether [the] PSI summary \naccurately reflects the information you provided to the authorized OPM \ninvestigator(s) and you can make any corrections, additions, deletions, and \nupdates necessary to make the summary clear and accurate. Alternatively, \nyou may object on the ground that the report is unauthenticated by a \nGovernment witness and the document may not be considered as evidence. \nIf no objections are raised in your response to this FORM, or if you do not \n\n3 \n \nrespond to this FORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that you \nhave waived any objections to the admissibility of the summary and may \nconsider the summary as evidence in your case (bold in original). \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe PSI, to comment on the PSI, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to the \ninformation in the PSI. In his FORM response, Applicant referred to a statement he made \nduring his subject interview to explain his financial issues. He did not otherwise comment \non the PSI or the summary report of his PSI. Given his reliance on an explanation he \nprovided during the PSI, and the absence of any objections, it is reasonable to infer that he \ndoes not object to consideration of the summary. Accordingly, FORM Items 1 through 5 are \naccepted into the record as Government exhibits (GEs). Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, \nwhich includes documentation of debt repayment, is admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 13, 2019, Applicant owed \ndelinquent debt totaling $24,646 on eight accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h). Under Guideline E, \nApplicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his February 13, 2019 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (or security clearance application \n(SCA)) by responding negatively to inquiries concerning whether he had any debts turned \nover for collection in the last seven years and whether he had any accounts or credit cards \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted each of the debts but \nindicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h had been paid. He answered \u201cI admit\u201d \nregarding the negative responses to the financial inquiries on his SCA, but he then \ndescribed it as \u201csimply a mistake on [his] part,\u201d and added that he \u201cwas not trying to hide \nanything.\u201d (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the debts are accepted as findings of fact. His response to \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is seen as an admission to having responded negatively to the inquiries but \nwithout intention to falsify. After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer \nto the SOR (GE 2), and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old senior electrical technician who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 2019. He requires a DOD security clearance for his position. \n(GEs 3-4.) He was apparently issued an interim security clearance that was withdrawn. (GE \n2; AE A.) Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in September 2011. He has been married \nsince November 2013. He has two sons who live with him and his wife. The younger son, \nwho was born in January 2017, is adopted. (GEs 2-3.)  It is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s \n\n4 \n \nolder son, who does not bear his surname, is his biological son, adopted, a stepson, or a \nfoster child. If the birthdates listed on the SCA for Applicant and this son are correct, \nApplicant was only 13 years old at the time of his son\u2019s birth. \n \nApplicant was unemployed while pursuing his associate\u2019s degree at a technical \ninstitute from September 2009 to September 2011. He obtained federal student loans of \n$3,500 and $6,000 in January 2010, a private student loan for $5,955 in July 2010, and a \nfederal student loan for $18,742 in September 2010. Applicant worked as a master \ntechnician for a commercial electronics company from January 2012 to November 2014, \nwhen he left the job voluntarily to move from state X to state Y. He was unemployed for the \nnext six months. From May 2015 to August 2017, Applicant was employed as a test \ntechnician for a power company. In August 2017, he and his family moved back to state X, \nand Applicant returned to work for the commercial electronics company for the next 14 \nmonths. In October 2018, Applicant and his family moved to their current residence, and he \nstarted a new job as a quality technician for a technology company. Applicant began his \ncurrent employment in February 2019 at a higher salary than in his previous employments. \n(GEs 3-4.) The record contains no information about his previous earnings. As for his \ncurrent income, Applicant indicated only that he makes less than $2,919 a month. It is \nunclear whether he was referring to his gross or net income. (AE A.) \n \nOn February 13, 2019, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA \nfor his current employment. He responded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries, \nincluding the following questions concerning delinquency involving routine accounts: \n \nIn the last seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? . . . [and] In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had any \naccount or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay \nas agreed?. . . . (GE 3.) \n \n \nAs of March 5, 2019, one or more of the three credit reporting agencies were \nreporting that Applicant\u2019s federal student loans with balances of $27,205 and $15,100 were \nin deferment, although they had been seriously past due in early 2015. Some accounts had \nbeen paid in collection back in March 2016, but Applicant was reportedly delinquent on the \neight accounts alleged in the SOR. (GE 5.) The record evidence for each debt in the SOR \nis as follows: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a charged-off loan debt for $17,614. (GE 1.) Applicant and a joint \nborrower (likely his spouse) obtained a vehicle loan for $26,819 in October 2016 and fell \nbehind in their payments from the start. The loan was past-due 30 days in November 2016 \nand 90 days in April 2017 before the vehicle was repossessed. The loan was charged off \nfor $17,614 in June 2017. (GEs 2, 4-5; AE A.) Applicant explained that he fell behind in his \npayments because his wife \u201chad to quit her job to take care of [their] son,\u201d and other family \nneeds took priority. (GEs 2, 4.)  On January 17, 2020, in response to the SOR, Applicant \nindicated that he would contact the creditor to establish a repayment plan. (GE 2.) He had \nno payment plan established as of his March 2020 response to the FORM. The collection \n\n5 \n \nentity now handling the debt is only willing to accept payments \u201con a 6-month schedule, \nwhich would amount to $2,919 per month,\u201d which is more than he earns in a month. (AE A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off student loan for $2,744. (GE 1.) Applicant obtained an \nunsecured guarantee loan for $5,955 in June 2010 with repayment at $22 a month. A debt \nof $2,744 was charged off after no account activity since September 2013. As of January \n2019, the account was $1,531 past due with a balance of $2,744. (GE 5.) After he received \nthe SOR, Applicant arranged to repay the debt at $80 a month. He made his first $80 \npayment on March 10, 2020. If his clearance eligibility is reinstated, he anticipates that he \nwill be able to make a larger payment to settle the debt, which now stands at $2,663. (AE \nA.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a joint deposit-related debt for $156. (GE 1.) Applicant and a joint \nowner opened a bank account in January 2012. After the account was closed, $156 in \noverdraft fees were charged off in April 2016. (GEs 4-5.) Applicant recognized the debt \nwhen questioned about it during his May 2019 PSI and indicated that his spouse was \nstaying in touch with the creditor and trying to settle the account. (GE 4.) Yet, when he \nanswered the SOR in January 2020, Applicant stated that he had previously been unaware \nof the debt and indicated he would contact the creditor to make a payment. (GE 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse paid $156.63 by credit card on February 28, 2020, which resolved the \ndebt. (AE A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a cellular phone debt in collection for $3,257. (GE 1.) Applicant recalled \nduring his PSI that when he switched providers, his new provider promised to pay off his \nold contract for him, but failed to do so. (GE 4.) His account was assigned for collection in \nJune 2017 after no activity since April 2015. As of February 2019, the debt had not been \npaid. (GEs 4-5.) Applicant asserted in response to the SOR on January 17, 2020, that the \ndebt had been paid, and that the account was closed as of January 4, 2020. (GE 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s March 2020 credit report shows that the debt was legally satisfied for less than \nthe full balance. A statement from the collection entity shows that he paid $651 in full \nsettlement of the debt on August 15, 2019. (AE A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a phone debt in collection for $300, which Applicant indicates was \nincurred in state Y and then not paid after he and his family moved back to state X in \nAugust 2017. (GE 2.) His account was assigned for collection in December 2018. As of \nFebruary 2019, the debt had not been paid. (GE 5.) Applicant attributes the debt to him and \nhis family living beyond their means (GE 2), although he provided no specific information in \nthat regard. Applicant paid the debt on February 26, 2020. (AE A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a cable television debt in collection for $260, which was a bill for service \nin state Y that went unpaid after he and his family moved back to state X. (GE 2.) His \naccount was assigned for collection in December 2018. As of February 2019, the debt had \nnot been paid. (GE 5.) Applicant provided documentation showing that he paid $137 by \ncredit card on February 26, 2020. Experian is reporting the debt as paid after collection as \nof March 1, 2020. (AE A.) \n\n6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a medical debt in collection for $163 from August 2015. His account \nwas assigned for collection in May 2016. As of February 2019, the debt had not been paid. \n(GE 5.) On January 17, 2020, Applicant stated that he would contact the collection entity \nand pay the debt this year. (GE 2.) Applicant satisfied the debt on February 26, 2020. (AE \nA.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a collection debt for $152 incurred with a credit services company. His \naccount was assigned for collection in January 2019 after no activity since September \n2018. As of February 2019, the credit bureaus were reporting the debt as unpaid. (GE 5.) In \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant provided a confirmation number as evidence that he had \npaid the debt on February 28, 2019. (GE 2.) Creditor documentation submitted by Applicant \nin response to the FORM corroborates the debt was paid in full in February 2019. (AE A.) \n  \n \nOn May 2, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) about his delinquent accounts and his failure to list \nthem on his SCA. Applicant acknowledged that he had some financial issues, but he \nexplained that he did not know specific information about his accounts because his spouse \nhandled their finances. He indicated that his debts had been paid, but when confronted with \nthe adverse information on his March 2019 credit report, Applicant did not dispute that he \nstill owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. He provided some details about the debts, including \nthat the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was owed on a loan for a repossessed vehicle, and indicated \nthat his spouse was trying to settle those debts. He did not recognize some collection \ndebts, including the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h but expressed his belief that those \nthree debts and a medical bill not covered by insurance (SOR \u00b6 1.g) had been paid. \nApplicant explained that his financial issues were due to \u201chard times\u201d and not to living \nbeyond his means, carelessness, or financial irresponsibility. He cited his geographic \nrelocations and changes of jobs, which put him in the position of having to catch up on \nexpenses. He described his current financial situation as stable, and indicated that with the \nincome from his current job, he can save money to pay off his collection debts. Applicant \nexpressed a willingness to pay all his debts. He admitted that he had not had any financial \ncounseling or utilized any debt consolidation services, but he and his spouse were working \non rebuilding their credit, saving money, and paying their bills. In response to why he had \nnot listed any delinquencies on his SCA, Applicant stated that he was unsure how to report \nthe information because he did not feel that his situation fit the specific sections, and there \nwas no place for comments to explain his financial situation. (GE 4.) \n \nThe DCSA CAF issued an SOR to Applicant on December 13, 2019, because of the \noutstanding delinquencies listed on his March 2019 credit report and because of his failure \nto list any past-due debts on his February 2019 SCA. (GE 1.) In response, Applicant \nadmitted the debts and stated in part: \n \nThese charges were from a particularly difficult time in life, we were living \npaycheck to paycheck and any time something happened we had to make a \nsacrifice. We would have to choose which bills to pay at which time. At that \ntime we were not able to regularly catch back up. At my current position I am \ndoing much better with my bills and keeping up with things. (GE 2.) \n\n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant indicated on January 17, 2020, that he would make arrangements to repay \nthe defaulted car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he would pay his other outstanding debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c and 1.e-1.g) this year. He stated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h had been \npaid, and provided a confirmation number for the latter but no documentation of payment \nfor either debt. Applicant explained that the defaulted car loan did not appear on his credit \nreport and that he would have taken care of the debts sooner had he the means to do so. \nHe expected to be able to address his remaining financial issues \u201conce [his] clearance is \nreinstated.\u201d As for his failure to list any debs on his SCA, Applicant stated: \n \nThis was simply a mistake on my part. I spoke to an investigator about this \nissue in April [sic] of last year, before my interim clearance was issued. I was \nnot trying to hide anything and am honest about my financial struggles. (GE \n2.) \n \n \nIn the Government\u2019s February 27, 2020 FORM, Department Counsel noted the lack \nof specific information in the record about circumstances that apparently stressed \nApplicant\u2019s finances, and the absence of corroborating or supporting documentation from \nApplicant showing resolution of any of the SOR debts. In response on March 18, 2020, \nApplicant provided a recent credit report and receipts showing that he had an established \nplan to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b and had resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h, as \nnoted above. He explained that the collection entity currently holding his defaulted car loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) wants payments that he cannot afford and is unwilling to work with him. \nApplicant indicated that he would continue to try to resolve the account, and added: \n \nAs I stated in my subject interview, these issues were from a time that I was \nnot in a financially stable position to settle these debts. In my current position, \nwith my clearance reinstated, I can continue to make smart financial \ndecisions and work on my credit. (AE A.) \n \n \nThe record contains little detail about Applicant\u2019s income, expenses, or savings. As \nof March 2010, Experian reported that he had a $129 current balance on a low-limit credit-\ncard account opened in August 2019 and a $2,880 balance on a joint installment loan \nobtained for $3,221 in August 2019 that was being repaid on time at $129 a month. His \nfederal student loans were in deferment with balances of $35,937 and $15,850. They were \nrated as current but had been 120 days or more delinquent in May and June 2014 and \nagain in January and February 2015. In February 2017, Applicant paid off a vehicle loan \nobtained for $24,299 in May 2015. The car loan for the repossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nwas still on his credit report as past due for $17,614 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His credit score was 594 \nas of March 18, 2020, which is considered \u201cfair.\u201d (AE A.) \n\n8 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \n\n9 \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances in \na way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a nexus \nbetween proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant\u2019s record of financial delinquency on the \neight accounts in the SOR establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. One \nor more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n10 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on his student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in 2013 and on a cell-phone \ncontract (SOR \u00b6 1.d) in 2015. He did not pay a $163 medical bill (SOR \u00b6 1.g) incurred in \nAugust 2015. Overdraft fees on a joint bank account were charged off in April 2016 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). In 2017, he defaulted on a car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and on cell phone (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and \ncable television (SOR \u00b6 1.f) bills incurred in state Y. His account with a credit-services \ncompany (SOR \u00b6 1.h) from September 2018 went to collections in January 2019. While \nsome of the debts were incurred more than five years ago, none of the debts in the SOR \nhad been resolved as of his February 13, 2019 SCA. Applicant\u2019s debts are considered \nrecent because an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2018) (citing e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nDuring his PSI, Applicant stated that his financial problems were caused by \u201chard \ntimes\u201d and not by living beyond his means, carelessness, or financial irresponsibility. He \nindicated that his financial issues started because he relocated and changed jobs, which \nput him in a position of having to catch up on expenses. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability \nin that while Applicant voluntarily left his job with the commercial electronics company in \nNovember 2014 to move to state Y, he likely did not expect to be unemployed for the next \nsix months. The $3,257 cell phone debt became delinquent around that time. Even so, \nsome concern arises about his financial judgment, given he apparently relocated without a \njob offer in place. Moreover, his unemployment from November 2014 to May 2015 does not \nexplain his default of his student loan in 2013 while he was gainfully employed by the \ncommercial electronics company. Low income was apparently a factor in his student-loan \ndefault, but he provided little detail about his financial situation at that time. With scant \ninformation in the record about his income or expenses, it cannot be determined whether \nhe acted reasonably under his circumstances at that time. His scheduled student loan \npayment was only $22 a month. AG \u00b6 20(b) could partially mitigate his default of the car \nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in that he lost his spouse\u2019s income when she quit work to care for their \nson. However, the evidence suggests that he obtained a loan that he could not afford to \nrepay from the start. He was behind in his loan payments even before their adopted son \nwas born in January 2017. \n \n\n11 \n \nMoreover, Applicant does not receive full mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because \nhe did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to \ncontacting his creditors to resolve old delinquencies after he moved back to state X and full-\ntime work at the commercial electronics company in August 2017. Additionally, neither he \nnor his spouse for him paid the final bills for cable television and phone service in state Y, \nand a $152 debt from September 2018 went to collection in January 2019. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d), Applicant is credited with paying the $152 debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) in late February 2019, after he completed his SCA but before his PSI. He paid \n$651 in full settlement of the $3,257 cellular phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) in August 2019, before \nhe received the SOR. In late February 2020, after he answered the SOR, he or his spouse \nfor him satisfied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e-1.g. The timing of resolution of financial \nproblems is an important consideration in evaluating mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). In ISCR \nCase No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. June 7, 2019), the Appeal Board stated that \u201can \napplicant who takes action to resolve his financial problems only after being placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her \nown interests.\u201d Applicant did not provide documentation of income or circumstances that \ncould reasonably justify his delay in addressing those debts. He apparently earns less than \n$2,919 per month, which is not a considerable income with a family of four. Even so, a \ncomponent of financially responsible behavior is whether an applicant remains in contact \nwith his creditors, and Applicant\u2019s evidence in that regard is lacking. He would have had a \nmuch stronger case in mitigation had he provided documentation showing ongoing efforts \nto resolve the credit issues discussed during his May 2019 PSI. AG \u00b6 20(c) cannot fully \napply because he has not had any financial counseling that is required for full mitigation. \nHowever, favorable findings are made with respect to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h because \nthey have been satisfied or legally settled. \n \nRegarding the car-loan deficiency (SOR \u00b6 1.a) on which no payments have been \nmade, and the student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) that he has begun repaying at $80 a month, \nApplicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or even \nthat the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). The Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) \nthat \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \nApplicant has an established arrangement for his student loan, and he made his first \npayment. Because of his delay in addressing the debt, he lacks a sustained track record of \npayments. Nonetheless, the monthly payment is affordable, and his resolution of the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h provide some assurance that he will make his agreed upon payments for \nhis student loan. AG \u00b6 20(d) has some applicability to that debt. Applicant has no \nrepayment arrangement in place for the $17,614 car debt that continues to adversely affect \nhis credit score. The debt is now held by a collection agency unwilling to accept payments \nin an amount Applicant can afford. \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \n\n12 \n \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s March 2020 credit report contains some positive financial indicators. He paid off \na $24,299 car loan in February 2017. As of March 2020, he had only two open credit \naccounts other than his deferred Federal student loans: a credit card with a $129 balance \nand an installment loan with a $2,880 balance. Both accounts are current. He does not \nhave a record of extensive reliance on credit. It is unclear when his Federal student loans \ntotaling some $41,775 will no longer be deferred or whether he can afford to make his \nstudent loans payments at that time. A reasonably accurate assessment of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation cannot be made without knowing his present expenses. Apparently, the \ncreditor owed the $17,614 debt is pursuing Applicant for collection, given the debt is now \nheld by a collection entity, and it remains on his credit report. His progress toward resolving \nhis other past-due accounts weighs in his favor, but the $17,614 delinquency is substantial \nin relation to his income. With so little information in the record about his financial situation, \nit cannot be determined whether Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are behind him or will not \nreoccur. The financial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nApplicant responded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries on his February \n13, 2019 SCA, including questions concerning whether, in the last seven years, he had any \nbills or debts turned over to a collection agency, and whether, in the last seven years, he \nhad any accounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay \nthem on agreed upon terms. Applicant admits that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the inquiries, but he \nasserts that it was \u201csimply a mistake on [his] part,\u201d and he \u201cwas not trying to hide anything.\u201d \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n \n\n13 \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence \nto explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s denial of intentional falsification has to be evaluated in light of other \nevidence of record, including his March 2019 credit report which substantiates the \ndelinquencies, and evidence showing that he knew about some of the debts. When \nApplicant was interviewed by the OPM investigator in May 2019, he initially stated that he \nknew he had some financial issues but he did not know what they were because his spouse \nhandles their financial matters, including paying the bills. He indicated that his wife had \nbeen working on correcting their credit, and had paid off his debts. Yet, when confronted \nwith the specific debts listed on his March 2019 credit report (GE 5), Applicant recognized \nthe $17,614 debt as the deficiency on a loan for a vehicle that had been repossessed (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a). He also recognized his student loan delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.b), the bank overdraft \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and the $3,257 cell-phone debt incurred when he changed providers, and \nhis new provider failed to pay off his old contract (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He no longer claimed that his \ndebts had been paid. Instead, he stated that his spouse was trying to settle those debts. He \nthen explained that he had not listed those accounts on his SCA because there was no \nplace to explain his financial situation, which he did not feel fit into the specific sections. \nApplicant did not elaborate about his understanding of the financial record inquiries, which \nin addition to the inquiries about collection and charged-off debts, include questions about \nany possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed in the last seven years, \nand any loan defaults in the last seven years. Even if Applicant mistakenly thought his \nspouse had paid his debts, it would not relieve him of his obligation to report them on his \nSCA. It is simply not plausible that Applicant could believe in good faith that none of the \nfinancial record inquiries applied to his financial situation, given he had a car repossessed \nfor nonpayment in 2017, within two years of his February 2019 SCA. Without an opportunity \nto confront Applicant in person and assess his credibility on the issue, it is particularly \ndifficult to discount the objective evidence of financial delinquency that clearly should have \nbeen reported on his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n\n14 \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) and AG \u00b6 17(e) have some applicability because the DOD through its \ninvestigation became aware that Applicant has had financial problems. However, it is \ndifficult to fully apply AG \u00b6 17(a) because although Applicant admitted to the OPM \ninvestigator that he had financial issues, he initially claimed he did not know what they \nwere. It was only after he was confronted with the information of outstanding delinquency \non his credit record that he admitted he had lost a car to repossession and that his spouse \nwas still working on settling some of his accounts. Concerning AG \u00b6 17(e), it is unclear if \nanyone apart from his spouse knows about his financial situation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(b) and 17(f) \nwere not shown to be have any applicability. AG \u00b6 17(c) warrants some consideration \nbecause Applicant\u2019s SCA falsification was \u201cinfrequent\u201d and not repeated during his PSI. He \ntook some positive steps in reform under AG \u00b6 17(d) by providing details of his delinquent \naccounts to the investigator after confrontation, but he has yet to provide a credible \nexplanation for his omission of known debts from his SCA. Even assuming that Applicant \ntasked his spouse with correcting his credit, he had an obligation to ensure that he \nresponded accurately to the questions on the SCA, and he failed in that regard. The \nsecurity concerns about his personal conduct are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n15 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nshow that his financial situation is sufficiently stable and not likely to present an ongoing \nsecurity concern. As discussed above, too many unanswered questions exist about his \nfinancial situation. Moreover, because Applicant chose to have his security clearance \neligibility evaluated without a hearing, I was unable to assess his sincerity and demeanor. \nThe record evidence left me with doubts about Applicant\u2019s candor with respect to his SCA \nomissions. He presented no employment or character references attesting to his judgment \nand reliability in handling his personal and work affairs. The Appeal Board has repeatedly \nheld that the government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard \nclassified information before denying or revoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009, citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, \n238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security \nclearance in the future, especially if he is able to demonstrate a track record of financial \nstability, and of reliability and trustworthiness with regard to his representations. However, \nbased on the evidence before me, a clearance grant is not warranted at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n16 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Administrative Judge \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 24, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \n \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 25, 2020, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received \nthe File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 28, 2020, and interposed no objections to \nthe materials in the FORM. He did not supplement the record.  \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated 15 delinquent debts \nexceeding $27,000 and (b) failed to file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through \n2018 and  is indebted to the state for delinquent taxes in the amount of $275 for tax \nyear 2016. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s debts and unfiled state tax returns remain unresolved.  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations covering \ndelinquent debts and failure to file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2018, but \ndenied allegations that he is indebted for delinquent taxes owed for tax year 2016. He \nprovided no explanations for any of the debts covered by \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1-o, but claimed he \npaid in full all state taxes owing for prior tax years with his 2019 state income tax return.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old instructor for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \n \nBackground \n \n \nApplicant married in August 1995 and separated in May 2002. (Item 3) He has \none adult child from this marriage. Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree from a \nbusiness college in September 2002. (Item 3)  He enlisted in the U.S. Army in February \n1987 and served eight and one-half years. (Item 3) He received in August 1997 for \nreported medical reasons. (Item 3) Since February 2011, Applicant has been employed \nas an instructor for a defense contractor. (Item 3)  He reported unemployment between \nNovember 2010 and February 2011 and worked for various non-defense contractors \nbetween 1997 and 2010. (Item 3) Applicant held a security clearance during his Army \nenlistment at the level of secret. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \n \nBetween November 2011 and May 2019, Applicant accumulated 15 delinquent \ndebts exceeding $27,000. (Items 4-6) He provided no documentation showing that he \nhas addressed any of these listed accounts, and they remain unresolved and \noutstanding. Records also confirm that Applicant failed to file state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2018. While he claims to have paid the only tax debt owing \nto the state (i.e., the sum of $275) with his 2019 state tax return, he provided no \ndocumentation of any amounts paid or owing and since resolved. He attributed his \nfailures to file state income tax returns to his beliefs that he did not owe anything. (Item \n4) Undetermined at this time is whether Applicant ever filed state tax returns for the tax \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nyears stated (2010-2018) and whether he owes any monies for these tax years. Without \ndocumentation of filing his returns for these years and paying any amounts owing, he \ncannot be credited with resolving any of the tax issues raised in the SOR. \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \n \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n        \nBurdens of Proof \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1.  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts \n(including a $275 state tax debt) and multiple failures to file his state tax returns. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the application of three of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d: 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d Each of \nthese DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debt delinquencies and failures to file his state tax returns \nas required (tax years 2010-2018) negate the need for any independent proof. See \nDirective 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006) His \nadmitted debts and tax filing lapses are fully documented and create some judgment \nissues. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies and tax return filing lapses. \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax filing failures and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s multiple failures to file his state tax returns as required and debt \ndelinquencies he accumulated over a period of years that he has failed to resolve \npreclude his taking advantage of any of the potentially available extenuating benefits. \nBecause Applicant has failed to provide any documented evidence of his timely filing of \nstate tax returns for years 2010-2018, or initiated efforts to resolve his admitted \ndelinquent debts, mitigating credit cannot be extended under any of the potentially \navailable mitigating conditions.  \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of tax-related and other debts, and implicitly where applicable the \ntimely resolution of such debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, \n2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, he has failed to take any documented steps to address his \naccumulated delinquent debts or provide documented evidence of his timely filing of his \nstate tax returns for tax years 2010-2018 and provide proofs of his addressing his \ndelinquent debts in issue.   \n \nWhole-person assessment \n \n \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his civilian contributions to \nthe defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his state tax-\nfiling lapses and failures to resolve his accumulated debt delinquencies. His failures to \naddress and resolve his state tax-filing lapses and accumulated debt delinquencies \nreflect adversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently stable manner to \nmeet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1-p:  \n                Against Applicant \n \n        \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 8, 2019, Applicant owes charged-off debts of $18,145 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $6,699 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and $2,168 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and collection debts of $3,066 (SOR \u00b61.c); $895 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $4,763 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); $4,593 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and $437 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts and asserted he was making a good-faith effort to address the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h through a DMP. He stated that he had entered into agreements with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g to make monthly payments on those debts and was adhering to those agreements. He related that he was pursuing refinancing options to repay his student-loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (Item 2.) After considering Items 1 through 6, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (Item 2), and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 39 years old and a native of the Philippines. He came to the United States as a child and became a naturalized U.S. citizen on his own application in July 2008. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2004 and a master\u2019s degree in May 2014. Applicant has worked for a succession of defense contractors since July 2014, and he was granted a DOD secret clearance in September 2014. (Item 3.)

In late October 2019, he entered into a debt-management plan \n(DMP) to address seven unsecured consumer-credit debts totaling $35,577, requiring \nmonthly payments of $835. As of February 2020, he had paid $7,747 toward his delinquent \ndebts, including $3,806 under the DMP. Clearance is granted on the condition that he \ncontinue to make timely payments toward his delinquencies. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn November 22, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record without a hearing. On December 31, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 6. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the \nFORM to Applicant on January 2, 2020, and informed him that any response was due \nwithin 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on January 13, 2020, and \nresponded to the FORM on February 12, 2020. On February 13, 2020, Department \nCounsel indicated that the Government had no objection to Applicant\u2019s response to the \nFORM. On February 18, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. I received the case file on February 21, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 4, a summary report of a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on April 23, 2019. The summary report was part of \nthe DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, \na DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence and considered with an \nauthenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of \nEvidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, \nApplicant was advised as follows: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 4) is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to the [FORM], you can comment on whether [the] \nPSI summary accurately reflects the information you provided to the \nauthorized OPM investigator(s) and you may make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear and \naccurate. Alternatively, you may object on the ground that the report is \nunauthenticated by a Government witness and the document may not be \nconsidered as evidence. If no objections are raised in your response to this \nFORM, or if you do not respond to this FORM, the Administrative Judge may \n\n3 \n \ndetermine that you have waived any objections to the admissibility of the \nsummary and may consider the summary as evidence in your case. \n \nApplicant did not mention the PSI in his response to the FORM. Concerning whether \nApplicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, \nApplicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond \nthose afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of \nthe Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or \nproven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide \nfor a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of \nhis opportunity to object to the admissibility of the PSI, to comment on the PSI, and to make \nany corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the PSI. Applicant is deemed to \nhave waived any objections to the PSI. \n \nAccordingly, Items 1 through 6 were accepted into the record as exhibits for the \nGovernment. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 8, 2019, Applicant owes \ncharged-off debts of $18,145 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $6,699 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and $2,168 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); \nand collection debts of $3,066 (SOR \u00b61.c); $895 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $4,763 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); $4,593 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g); and $437 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he \nadmitted the debts and asserted he was making a good-faith effort to address the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h through a DMP. He stated that he had entered into \nagreements with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g to make monthly payments on \nthose debts and was adhering to those agreements. He related that he was pursuing \nrefinancing options to repay his student-loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (Item 2.) \n \n \nAfter considering Items 1 through 6, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR \n(Item 2), and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of \nfact: \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and a native of the Philippines. He came to the United \nStates as a child and became a naturalized U.S. citizen on his own application in July 2008. \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2004 and a master\u2019s degree in May 2014. Applicant \nhas worked for a succession of defense contractors since July 2014, and he was granted a \nDOD secret clearance in September 2014. (Item 3.) \n \nApplicant was married from January 2012 to December 2015. He lived with his \nparents from May 2014 to January 2016, when he began a cohabitant relationship with his \ncurrent girlfriend, so he and his ex-wife may have separated in May 2014. In October 2018, \nApplicant began renting an apartment near his girlfriend, and he was spending about 30% \n\n4 \n \nof his time in that apartment. Applicant has two daughters, age 8 years and age 11 months, \nrespectively. They live with him and his cohabitant girlfriend. (Items 3-4.) \n \n \nAfter graduating from college, Applicant worked as a computer-aided design \ntechnician for an engineering company until April 2005. He then worked as a service \nmanager until October 2013, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from November \n2013 to July 2014. He collected unemployment benefits and was a stay-at-home father \nwhile his ex-wife worked. In July 2014, Applicant began working as an analyst in the \ndefense industry. He began his current employment in July 2018. (Item 3.) Applicant did not \nprovide any details about his income when he was employed or his unemployment \ncompensation. \n \n \nAs part of the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program, Applicant\u2019s credit was checked \non November 7, 2018. Seven delinquent accounts totaling $37,729 were on his credit \nreport. (Item 6.)  On March 11, 2019, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial inquiries into \ndelinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant indicated that he lost a home to \nforeclosure in December 2016 after being unable to pay his mortgage due to limited \nincome. (Item 3.) Available credit information shows that he obtained a $137,040 mortgage \nloan in October 2008, to be repaid at $1,095 monthly. He was current on his mortgage \npayments during his marriage, but he defaulted on the payments after his divorce. The loan \nbalance was paid by insurance. (Item 5.) Applicant also listed on his SF 86 collection debts \nof $4,763 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); $5,030 (SOR \u00b61.g); and $310 (not alleged in SOR). He indicated \nthat he had an established repayment plan for the $4,763 that will conclude in August 2020; \nwas awaiting a repayment plan for the $5,030 debt; and had paid the medical debt in \nFebruary 2019. (Item 3.) \n \n \nAs of March 23, 2019, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed the following delinquencies \non his credit record: \n \n\uf0be A credit-card account opened in September 2005 was charged off for $18,145 in \nMay 2017 due to inactivity since September 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). As of March 2019, \nthe debt was unpaid. \n \n\uf0be An $8,000 line-of-credit account opened in May 2006 was charged off for $6,699 in \nDecember 2017 for failure to make the $169 monthly payment since June 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). As of February 2019, the debt was unpaid. \n \n\uf0be A student loan obtained in August 1999 for $6,060 was in collection for $3,066 for \nfailure to make the $64 monthly payment since February 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). As of \nMarch 2019, the debt was unpaid. \n \n\uf0be A credit-card account opened in February 2005 was charged off for $2,168 in \nAugust 2017 for nonpayment since December 2016. As of March 2019, the account \nbalance was $2,162 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \n\n5 \n \n\uf0be A retail charge account opened in February 2008 with a $700 credit limit was in \ncollection for $895 due to nonpayment since October 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). As of March \n2019, the debt was unpaid. \n \n\uf0be A $4,763 charge-account delinquency from February 2017 was acquired by a \ncollection entity in June 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). As of March 2019, the debt was unpaid.  \n \n\uf0be A $4,593 credit-card balance from January 2017 was placed for collection in August \n2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). As of March 2019, the debt was unpaid. \n \n\uf0be A $437 credit-card balance from December 2016 was placed for collection in \nNovember 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). As of March 2019, the debt was unpaid. \n \n \nAs of February 2019, Applicant was making timely payments on a credit card with a \n$1,200 balance. He owed federal student-loan debts of $100,239 and $22,066, which were \nrated as current. (Item 5.) Apparently, they were in a hardship deferment as Applicant was \nmaking no payments on his student loans. (AE A.) \n \n \nOn April 23, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant attributed his financial delinquencies to \nhis lack of income and divorce proceedings, although he did not provide any details of his \nincome or the cost of his divorce. He indicated that he has been repaying the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f at $247 per month, and that he was still trying to negotiate repayment plans for the \ncredit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. Applicant denied that he had any accounts in \ncollection or more than 120 days past due. Then confronted about the $895 delinquency \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), Applicant indicated that he though he had paid it off, and he indicated that he \nwould provide proof of satisfaction within five days. Applicant denied that he had any other \ndelinquent accounts. When then confronted with the $3,066 student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \nApplicant admitted that he had not resolved the debt. When confronted about the charged-\noff credit-card debts for $18,145 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $2,168 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and the charged-off \npersonal loan for $6,699 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), Applicant expressed his belief that the debts never \nwent to collections, and because the debts had been charged off, he did not have to report \nthem on his SF 86 or take any action to resolve them. He stated that he was willing to pay \nthe debts, but that they had been charged off. Applicant had not had any financial \ncounseling, but admitted that he had been irresponsible in relying too heavily on consumer \ncredit cards. He expressed an intention to avoid incurring delinquent debts in the future, \nand indicated that his financial situation was improving. (Item 5.)   \n \n \n \nPayment records indicate that, on March 18, 2019, Applicant made the first of $264 \nmonthly payments toward debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. As of his February 4, 2020 payment, he had \nmade 12 payments totaling $3,175 toward the debt. On October 18, 2019, Applicant made \na $356 payment toward the collection entity holding the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. After \nthat payment, he made $136 monthly payments from November 2019 through January \n2020. (AE A.) Those payments were apparently being allocated to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \n(Item 2.) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nOn October 25, 2019, Applicant entered into a DMP in which he listed $35,577 in \nunsecured debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $18,145; SOR \u00b6 1.b, $6,699; SOR \u00b6 1.d, $2,162; SOR \u00b6 1.e, \n$895; SOR \u00b6 1.f, $2,646; SOR 1.g, $4,593; and SOR \u00b6 1.h, $437). Under the DMP, he \nagreed to make $835 monthly payments starting November 1, 2019, with $763 of his \nmonthly payment to be paid out to his creditors. Under the DMP, his debts would be \nliquidated over the next 52 months. Applicant continued to make separate payments to the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.h while also making payments under the DMP. Following an initial \n$50 payment to enter the DMP, Applicant made DMP payments of $985 in November 2019 \nand December 2019, and of $893 in January 2020 and February 2020. As of his response \nto the FORM, he had paid a total of $3,806 to the DMP. (AE A.) \n \n \nAs of October 2019, Applicant was paying $315 a month on a vehicle loan, $800 a \nmonth in utility expenses, $2,099 for housing, $15 a month toward a credit card, and \n$1,043 in miscellaneous household expenses. He was setting $25 a month aside as \nrequired by an unspecified \u201chardship program.\u201d He reported net income of $5,150 per \nmonth. (AE A.) \n \n \nOn November 8, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of his \ndefaulted student loan and the consumer-credit delinquencies included in his DMP. When \nApplicant responded to the SOR, he indicated that he was making payments toward the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.e, and 1.h through the DMP, and toward the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g under separate agreements with those creditors. (Item 2.) He provided \ndocumentation showing his payments in response to the FORM in February 2020. (AE A.) \n    \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n7 \n \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances in \na way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \n\n8 \n \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a nexus \nbetween proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Over the two years following his December 2015 \ndivorce, Applicant defaulted on a student loan and on seven consumer credit accounts. As \nof March 2019, he owed $40,766 in delinquent debts. Under AG \u00b6 19, disqualifying \nconditions 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. One \nor more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the debts have been delinquent for some time, and although \nhe started repaying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f in March 2019, none of the debts have been fully \nresolved. Applicant\u2019s debts are considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid \ndebts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to lack of income and his divorce, which \nare circumstances that could mitigate financial issues under AG \u00b6 20(b). However, \nApplicant did not provide any information about his income or expenses between 2015 and \n2017 that could mitigate his disregard of several financial obligations around that time. He \n\n9 \n \nmay have had expenses of caring for his then four-year-old daughter, but he provided no \ndetails. He moved in with his girlfriend in January 2016, but it is unclear to what extent he \nand his girlfriend shared expenses. \n \n \nEven assuming that factors outside of his control contributed to or caused his \nfinancial problems, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible manner \nwhen dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n2005)). He failed to act responsibly in several respects. There is no evidence that Applicant \nattempted to contact his creditors about his debts before they came to the attention of the \nDOD in November 2018. He had some income to make payments as he had been \nconsistently employed in the defense industry since July 2014. As his delinquencies went \nunpaid, he began renting a separate apartment in October 2018. While it may have been a \nrefuge for him when he needed some time away from his girlfriend, it is evident that his \npast-due debts were not a priority for him. Even if he thought he could do nothing about \ndebts that had been charged off, he had other accounts in collections. \n \n \nThe timing of resolution of financial problems is an important consideration in \nevaluating mitigation. Applicant began taking efforts to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \n1.g shortly before he completed his March 2019 SF 86. In ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 \n(App. Bd. June 7, 2019), the Appeal Board stated that \u201can applicant who takes action to \nresolve his financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her clearance is \nin jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self discipline to follow rules and regulations over \ntime or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.\u201d Nonetheless, \nApplicant is credited with following through on the repayment plans for those two debts. By \nthe time the SOR was issued in November 2018, Applicant had made nine months of \npayments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f and two payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He had \nentered into the DMP to repay his consumer-credit delinquencies and made a first payment \nof $985, which was in excess of the $835 required under the DMP. Applicant is credited \nwith some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) because of these payments. \nHowever, he has not had any financial counseling, which is required under AG \u00b6 20(c). \nEven after debt payments totaling $7,747 as of early February 2020, he still owes \napproximately $30,000 in past-due debt and has no repayment plan in place for the $3,066 \ndefaulted student loan. \n \n \nApplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has satisfied each \ndebt in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. June 5, 2006). \nHowever, he is required under Appeal Board precedent to demonstrate not only that he has \na plan to resolve his financial problems, but that he has taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006.) \nApplicant\u2019s repayment arrangements, and his consistent monthly payments, including for \nthe past 12 months toward the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, demonstrate a willingness to resolve his \ndebts provided he has the income to do so. \n\n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nBecause Applicant requested a decision on the written record, much remains \nunknown about his current expenses. Yet, he has made the payments as required under \nhis established repayment plans with no evidence of any new delinquency. The security \nclearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Even though Applicant\u2019s delay in addressing his delinquent \nobligations is not condoned, the security clearance adjudication is not intended as a debt \ncollection process or designed to punish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. \n \n \nIn exceptional cases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility \nfor a security clearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated. Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants \nDOHA administrative judges the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility \nfor a security clearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See also \nMemorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January \n12, 2018 (\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position . . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated in Appendix C is granted to any \nadjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance eligibility \nwhen they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \n \nCurrently, DOHA administrative judges do not have the authority to compel a third \nparty, such as an employer, to monitor a person\u2019s compliance with conditions. However, a \nfacility security officer has an independent obligation to report to the Government any \ninformation raising a security concern, including a cleared employee\u2019s failure to make his \ndebt payments. Applicant\u2019s record of debt repayment starting in March 2019 favors granting \na conditional clearance in this case. In exercising this discretionary authority, I have \ncarefully considered and weighed the financial considerations security concerns and \ndecided Applicant earned an opportunity to show that he can be counted on to rehabilitate \n\n11 \n \nand continue to repay his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is \nconditioned on him providing documentation to his facility security officer of his continued \ndebt repayments in compliance with his established plans.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant conditioned on him continuing to address his delinquent debts. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 1, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), Administrative Guidelines (AG) implemented June 2017, the Department of \nDefense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on \ninformation available to the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2020. The Department \nof Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 15, \n2020, scheduling the hearing for September 29, 2020.

He obtained his undergraduate \ndegree in 1996. Applicant completed his security clearance application on July 26, 2018. \nHe has held his current security clearance for about 8 years. Applicant was medically \ndischarged from the military in 1989. (Tr. 16) He has had extended periods of \nunemployment beginning in 2011. He has been employed with his current employer since \nJune 2018. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2011 through 2018; has a child-support arrearage account in \ncollection for $12,295; a charged-off delinquent loan in the approximate amount of \n$12,019 which resulted in a 2015 judgment; and a 2013 judgment in the amount of $5,689 \nfor a condominium association fee. Applicant admitted the allegations. He provided \nexplanations for each allegation. \nApplicant acknowledged his debts, and that he has not filed his Federal and state \nincome tax returns but this was triggered by the 2010 traumatic event of his wife leaving \nthe marriage and having a child with another man. In addition, his wife took Applicant\u2019s \nson with her and would not allow Applicant to see him. (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant admitted that following the separation and divorce from his wife he was \npreoccupied with so much anger, depression, custody battles, legal costs, child support, \nand a series of financial challenges that he was prevented from being financially \nresponsible. (Answer) He added that he had been financially responsible for 40 years. He \nemphasized that he had no debt and an excellent credit score. However, he stated that \nhe began to address the tax filing issues when he learned about his security clearance \nissues. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant stated that as to SOR allegation 1.a, that he failed to file his Federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2018, he said he made multiple \nrequests of the IRS for records of income reports for the missing years in order to allow \nthe returns to be prepared and filed. He had always filed his income tax returns, and he \nalways paid his taxes before 2011? (Tr. 21) He believes that the amounts of tax withheld \nby employers for the periods in question were adequate to meet his obligations. He stated \nthat he and his father have tried without success to contact the IRS, but he has never had \na response from them. (Tr. 60) He submitted requests for transcripts for the years in \nquestion, but the requests are dated February 2019. (AE C) Applicant recently hired a tax \nadvisor to help him resolve the tax issue. (AE B) He has filed his 2018 and 2019 Federal \nincome tax returns. \nAs to SOR 1.b, Applicant stated that he cannot file the state income tax returns \nuntil he has filed the Federal tax returns. He believes that his withholding amounts are \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsufficient to meet his state tax obligations. He has now filed his state tax  returns for 2018 \nand 2019. (Tr. 58) \nAs to 1.c, the child support arrearage of $12,295, Applicant states that an \narrearage continues to exist. He was unemployed for 14 months in 2016, and he was \nstill required to pay $756 a month, (Tr. 23) His paycheck is being garnished. The arrears \nare not as high as they were. Applicant stated that he and his wife are trying to arrange \nan agreement that does not involve the child support system. (Tr. 33) Before the \nunemployment, he was paying the child support. (Tr. 29) \nAs to SOR 1.d, the 2015 judgment resulting from a delinquent loan of $12,019 for \na motorcycle, Applicant stated that he attempted to return the motorcycle, even though \nhe was never notified that it needed to be returned. (Tr. 25) He stated that it no longer \nappears on his credit report. It has not been resolved. (Tr. 73) \nAs to 1.e, the 2013 judgment for condominium fees in the amount of $5,689.24. \nHe stopped paying the fees in 2010. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished to satisfy the debt. \n(GX 8) He arranged a settlement for the account in April 2017, but did not submit any \ndocumentation showing settlement of the debt. He stated that he paid it in cash. (AE A) \nApplicant earns about $125,000 a year. He has not had any financial counseling. \n(Tr.91-94) He states that his credit score has greatly improved. (Tr. 31) He used his \nretirement savings to pay daily bills when he was unemployed on various occasions. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nFederal, state or local income tax as required\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are long-standing, and he acknowledges that he has \nnot resolved some of them. Applicant stated that he settled one debt but he did not \nprovide proof that he paid the settlement amount. Thus, from the record, even if he made \nthe payment, he provided no evidence that he made any good-faith efforts before he \nreceived the SOR. He has had his wages garnished for child support arrearages. \nApplicant also has not filed his Federal and state income tax returns for a number of years \nand is just now getting a preparer to help him file. He has not received financial \ncounseling. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain \nunresolved. Although he promises to address them and states that he does not owe that \nmuch in delinquent debt, he did not provide proof of debt resolution. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s unemployment on various \noccasions was beyond his control, along with his divorce and depression, he has not \nacted responsibly to address the resulting debts or file his tax returns for many years. His \nactions to file his Federal and state tax returns for tax yearsl 2018 and 2019 are good first \nsteps in correcting his tax situation; however, he did not make enough timely progress on \nhis tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2017 to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established.

He has made some progress in recent \nyears to address the tax filing issues, it is not sufficient. His judgment and reliability are in \nquestion. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s work career and unemployment, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial indebtedness \nand failure to file his Federal and state income tax returns from 2011 through 2017. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Access \nto classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 26, 2017. \nOn November 19, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline G. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 29, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on March 9, 2020. On March 17, 2020, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6, was sent to \nApplicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \n\n2 \n \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated March 17, 2020, and Applicant\u2019s receipt is \ndated March 24, 2020. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 \ndays after receiving it to submit information. He did not file a response. The case was \nassigned to me on June 2, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR allegations arise under Guideline G. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in January \n2012. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year probation and 120 hours of \ncommunity service, his license was suspended for one year, and he was required to \nattend six Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. Applicant admits this allegation. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 2014 for disturbing the \npeace after having consumed alcohol. He pleaded guilty and was fined. He admits this \nallegation.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, light law \nviolation, and failure to maintain lane in April 2016. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced \nto 36 hours in jail, one-year probation, and 120 hours of community service. He was \nrequired to wear an ankle monitor for three months and his license was suspended for \none year. Applicant admits this allegation with the correction that his license was not \nsuspended, but he was required to use an interlock device on his vehicle for one year. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was cited for public intoxication in November \n2018 and that the charge was dropped. He admits this allegation.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was examined by a licensed psychologist in \nAugust 2019 and diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, mild, in early remission. The \npsychologist stated that Applicant\u2019s history of binge drinking episodes and the related \nconsequences make him vulnerable to poor decision making that represents a threat to \nsensitive information. He admits this allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant, 27, is a geospatial analyst currently working for a defense contractor \nsince 2017. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He has resided with his girlfriend \nsince 2018. This is his first application for a security clearance. (GX 3; GX 4.)  \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol as a teenager at parties with his friends in \n2009. After joining a fraternity in college in 2011, Applicant began drinking beer on a daily \nbasis at fraternity parties. In January 2012, Applicant attended a fraternity party where he \nconsumed an excessive amount of alcohol. He was pulled over on his way back to his \ndormitory for driving the wrong way on a divided highway. He was convicted of DUI in \nApril 2012 and sentenced as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n\n3 \n \nIn March 2014, while still in college on spring break in Florida, Applicant consumed \nnumerous beers throughout the day on the beach with his friends. The group had rented \na locker to secure their belongings during the day. On the way back to their hotel, \nApplicant and his friends were stopped by police officers and questioned about a stolen \ncell phone. The group gave the officers permission to search their belongings and a cell \nphone that did not belong to anyone in the group was found in Applicant\u2019s friend\u2019s \nbackpack. The friend denied stealing the cell phone and the rest of the group, including \nApplicant, became loud and unruly in defending their friend\u2019s innocence. The friend was \narrested for theft of the cell phone and the rest of the members of the group, including \nApplicant, were cited for disturbing the peace. The disposition of the charge is as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant and several friends attended a fraternity party where they \nconsumed alcohol throughout the day.  In the afternoon, Applicant left the party and slept \nfor several hours, then awoke to join his friends for a late night dinner. Applicant thought \nhe was capable of legally driving, and drove the group out for dinner. On the way, \nApplicant was pulled over for a broken tail light. The officer questioned Applicant who \nadmitted to drinking earlier in the day, but stated he believed he was sober. The officer \nadministered a field sobriety test, which Applicant failed. The officer administered a \nbreathalyzer and Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) registered as .12, with the legal \nBAC limit being .08. He was arrested and the disposition of the case is as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c and corrected by Applicant. \n \nFollowing the April 2016 DUI arrest and conviction, Applicant underwent an alcohol \nuse psychological evaluation. The evaluation concluded that Applicant did not have an \nalcohol use disorder and it did not make any treatment recommendations. He has not \ndriven a vehicle after consuming any alcohol since the 2016 DUI. (GX 5.) \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant began voluntarily attending weekly AA meetings which he \ncontinued until April 2017. He discontinued attending AA meetings because he believed \nhe had matured, was making better decisions about his alcohol consumption, and did not \nhave an alcohol use problem. (GX 4.) \n \nIn November 2018, just after his twenty-sixth birthday, Applicant, attended a \nThursday night professional football game. Prior to attending the game, Applicant secured \na friend to be the designated driver. Applicant consumed numerous beers beginning in \nthe afternoon at the pregame festivities. At some point, Applicant went to the designated \ndriver\u2019s vehicle to sleep. At about 3:00 am, he was awoken by the police. Applicant was \ndetained by the police and charged with public intoxication. Later that morning, Applicant \ncalled his facility security officer (FSO) to report the charge, and the human resources \nofficer, who is also Applicant\u2019s mother, to take paid leave for the day. Applicant retained \nan attorney, and the charge was ultimately dropped. (GX 5.) \n \nConcerned about this incident, and due in part to his girlfriend\u2019s and his mother\u2019s \nconcern about his alcohol consumption, Applicant self-assessed his drinking pattern. He \ndetermined that it had resulted in conduct that was detrimental to him, and modified his \n\n4 \n \nbehavior, which includes no longer partying with his fraternity brothers. Applicant worked \nto find balance in his life by not involving alcohol in his activities and changing his social \ngroup. Applicant states that he has not been intoxicated since 2018. From \nNovember/December 2018 until April 2019, he voluntarily practiced abstinence from \nalcohol. Since then, Applicant rarely drinks. Once or twice a month, he drinks two to three \nbeers, but never more than three. He does not keep alcohol in his home. He states that \nhis \u201cpriorities were out of line in college and shortly after, which aided in some bad \ndecisions.\u201d He has since matured and prioritized his life much differently. (GX 4.) \n \nIn August 2019, at the behest of the DOD CAF, Applicant underwent a \npsychological evaluation performed by a clinical psychologist to assess potential security \nconcerns regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol use. The evaluator reviewed Applicant\u2019s 2016 \nevaluation, his 2017 e-QIP, and his personal subject interview with the background \ninvestigator, and contacted Applicant\u2019s two work supervisors. The evaluator interviewed \nApplicant and administered several psychological tests. The most relevant test that the \nevaluator administered was the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) which \n\u201cexamines problematic alcohol use.\u201d The results of this test indicated that Applicant was \nlow risk. (GX 5.) \n \n \nIn discussing Applicant\u2019s six-month period of abstinence followed by his ongoing \npractice of modified consumption, the evaluator stated that Applicant had not \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified alcohol consumption. He goes \non to state that \u201ctypically, one year of sustainable substance-use change is a beginning \ntoward sustainable change.\u201d He noted that Applicant\u2019s six months of sobriety was \npromising but \u201che has resumed a limited alcohol use that is likely to increase given past \nbehavior.\u201d The evaluator specifically cited Applicant\u2019s reported past binge-drinking \nepisodes and alcohol-related incidents as a basis for concern about Applicant\u2019s potential \nvulnerability from poor decision making. The evaluator observed that \u201clegal \nconsequences seem to occur after binge drinking episodes with his friends when his \njudgment is impaired . . . [and Applicant\u2019s] substance use appears to be significantly \ninfluenced by his peers.\u201d (GX 5.) \n \nThe evaluator concluded that the frequency of Applicant\u2019s past \u201cbinge drinking \nepisodes leaves him vulnerable to poor decisions and additional consequences in his \npersonal and professional life.\u201d The evaluator further stated that Applicant\u2019s \u201cdecision-\nmaking, while under the influence of alcohol, represents a threat to sensitive information.\u201d \nHe concluded that Applicant\u2019s past alcohol use raises concerns about future \nconsumption. He recommended that Applicant \u201creceive psychotherapy and/or reengage \nin self-help services (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous) . . . [and that he] should seriously \nconsider long-term sobriety from alcohol as a treatment goal.\u201d However, the evaluator did \nnot conclude that abstinence was mandatory for Applicant. (GX 5.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n5 \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n\n6 \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nThe Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol while in high school in 2009. After joining a \nfraternity in 2011, Applicant began consuming alcohol on a daily basis. While partying \n\n7 \n \nwith his fraternity brothers, he was arrested for DUI in 2012 and again in 2016 and \ncharged with disorderly conduct in 2014. Following his 2016 arrest, Applicant underwent \nan alcohol-use evaluation. The evaluator determined that Applicant did not have an \nalcohol-use disorder and made no treatment recommendations. Applicant has not driven \nafter consuming alcohol since this arrest. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related incident occurred in November 2018 when \nhe had just turned 26. In anticipation of a partying atmosphere at a professional football \ngame that would include drinking beer, he arranged to ride with a designated driver. \nDespite this effort to be more responsible, his over-consumption of alcohol resulted in an \nalcohol-related charge. Applicant\u2019s conduct following this incident reflects his realization \nthat his pattern of drinking was having an overall negative impact on his life. He \nimmediately contacted his FSO to report the incident. He then instituted changes in his \nalcohol consumption and his relationship with alcohol. He changed the pattern of his \nsocial life and he no longer keeps alcohol in his home.  Applicant has demonstrated his \nmaturity through his recognition that his alcohol-related antics, usually involving his \nfraternity brothers, are not acceptable conduct.  \n \n \nApplicant has not had any alcohol-related incidents since 2018. He has \nsuccessfully practiced modified consumption of alcohol for 18 months. The Directive does \nnot define \"recent,\" and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d \nconduct. The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a \nreasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges the negative impact his past pattern of alcohol \nconsumption had on his decision making. He voluntarily practiced abstinence for a period \nof six months, then responsibly resumed alcohol consumption at a moderate rate. He has \nsuccessfully established a pattern of moderate consumption for over one year. He has \nnot had any alcohol-related incidents at or away from work since 2018, and he has \nchanged his social life. While the 2019 evaluator recommended that Applicant work \ntowards abstaining from alcohol, he also determined that, under Applicant\u2019s ongoing \nmodified consumption practice, his mild alcohol use disorder is in remission. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) \nand 23(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \n \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \n\n8 \n \nconditions under Guideline G, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past \nalcohol use. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 15, 2019, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Position (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Item 3). On November \n27, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Item \n1) \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (Item 1) \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nOn January 18, 2020, Applicant provided his response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a decision without a hearing. (Item 2) On February 19, 2020, Department \nCounsel completed the File of Relevant Material (FORM). On March 2, 2020, Applicant \nwas served with a copy of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response, if any, was due on April 1, \n2020. No response was received. On May 26, 2020, the case was assigned to me.  \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. ISCR and ADP decisions and \nthe Directive are available at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/isp.html.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (Item 2) He \ndid not provide any supporting documentation about the status of delinquent debts in his \nSOR response. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional \nfindings follows.   \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old systems data analyst employed by a DOD contractor \nsince July 2009. (Item 3 at 7, 14) From 1993 to 2009, he served on active duty in the \nNavy, and he received an honorable discharge. (Id. at 17-18) In 1993, he received a \nhigh school diploma. (Id. at 12) In 2018, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Id. at 13) In \n1996, he married, and he is currently separated from his spouse. (Id. at 20-21) His \nchildren were born in 1997, 2000, 2009, and 2011. (Id. at 25-27) There is no evidence \nof workplace misconduct or criminal conduct. He did not provide copies of performance \nevaluations or character references.    \n  \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $49,961 as follows: 1.a is a \ncharged-off debt for $5,895; 1.b is a charged-off debt for $4,295; 1.c is a bank debt placed \nfor collection for $4,501; 1.d is a bank debt placed for collection for $16,501; 1.e is a \ncharged-off debt for $4,180; 1.f is a charged-off debt for $4,312; 1.g is a charged-off store \ndebt for $1,896; and 1.h is a charged-off debt for $8,841. \n \nIn his April 15, 2019 SCA, Applicant said the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($5,895), 1.b \n($4,285), 1.d ($16,359), 1.f ($4,312), 1.g ($1,896), and 1.h ($8,841) resulted from his \n\u201c[i]nability to make payments after sep[a]ration from spouse and solely funding my \nsustainment and agreements for child and spousal support during sep[a]ration.\u201d (Item 2 \nat 40-46). As for actions taken to resolve these debts, he said \u201cNo current action taken. \nWhen funds are available, [I] will work to make payments if before 3/2020 at which point \n3 year statute of limitations expires on legal action for unsecured credit debt.\u201d (Id.)   \n \nIn his April 15, 2019 SCA, Applicant did not mention the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($4,501). \n(Item 2) For the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($4,180), he said it resulted from \u201cfailure to pay \nunsecured credit card during dispute with separated spouse,\u201d and it was being resolved \nthrough garnishment of his wages. (Id. at 38). The garnishment was 15 percent of his \nwages, and the final payment was scheduled for May 30, 2019. (Id. at 39) Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSeptember 24, 2019 credit report, the most recent credit report of record, indicates the \nbalance is $184, and the date of last payment is June 2019. (Item 5) On July 30, 2019, \nApplicant provided proof to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that \nhis garnishment was successfully completed, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was resolved. \n(Item 3) \n \nIn the summary of Applicant\u2019s July 29, 2019 OPM personal subject interview (PSI), \nhe said that he separated from his spouse in September 2015. (Item 3 at 2) His spouse \ndid not work outside their home. (Id.) Applicant agreed to pay his spouse $4,000 monthly, \nand she agreed to pay their mortgage and utilities, and to take care of their children. (Id.) \nApplicant moved to a separate residence. (Id.) Applicant and his spouse used credit cards \nto fund any shortfalls in their income. (Id.) In July 2016, Applicant\u2019s son had a brain \naneurism and stroke. (Id.) His son had surgery, and he received extensive rehabilitation. \n(Id.) Applicant had good medical coverage; however, these medical problems resulted in \nadditional financial problems. (Id.) For a time, he borrowed from his 401(k) account to \nmaintain his credit cards and pay his support obligation. (Id.) In March 2017, he \u201cstopped \nmaking regular payments on his credit cards since they were unsecured and would not \nimpact on meeting his and his family\u2019s monthly living expenses.\u201d (Id.)  \n \nAfter March 2017, Applicant tried to make smaller payments to the credit card \ncompanies. (Item 3 at 2) He tried to arrange payment plans. (Id.) The credit card \ncompanies were unwilling to work with him, and he was unable to establish affordable \npayment plans. (Id. at 2-5) He said that after he completed the garnishment, and the \nstatute of limitations ends the risk of a lawsuit to collect the debts, he planned to attempt \nto establish payment plans to resolve his debts. (Id. at 5) He did not provide any \ndocumentation showing attempts to make payments or to establish payment plans. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 29, 2019 OPM PSI, Applicant said his monthly net income, \nincluding 40 percent disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs and a contribution \nfrom his cohabitant, was $9,247. (Id. at 5) His total monthly expenses included the \npayment of $4,000 to his spouse, but did not include his garnishment to pay the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, and totaled $7,929. (Id. at 5-6) His net monthly remainder was $1,318. (Id. at \n6) In June 2019, he completed paying the $1,200 monthly garnishment to address the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Id. at 3, 5-6) While the garnishment was ongoing, he reduced his \nsupport payments to his spouse by $300 monthly, and then after the garnishment, he \nprovided $4,300 to her monthly until the $300 deduction was repaid. (Id.) \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel noted the absence of corroborating or \nsupporting documentation of resolution of the SOR debts. Aside from Applicant\u2019s \nuncorroborated statements, there is no documentary evidence that Applicant paid, \narranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The \nrecord lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of \nthe causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information. The FORM \ninformed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM \u201cin which to submit \na documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, \nor explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any additional \ninformation . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nbased solely\u201d on the evidence set forth in this FORM. (FORM at 4 (emphasis added)) He \ndid not respond to the FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \n \n Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $49,961. Applicant\u2019s pay was \ngarnished to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($4,180). Payment of a debt \u201cthough garnishment \nrather than a voluntary effort diminishes its mitigating force.\u201d Compare ISCR Case No. \n08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation \nof financial considerations concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards delinquent tax debts is not mitigating \ninformation in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, \n2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an \nIRS garnishment, \u201cOn its face, satisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment \nof a creditor\u2019s garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of \nrepayment by the debtor.\u201d). On July 30, 2019, Applicant provided proof to the OPM \ninvestigator that his garnishment was successfully completed, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nwas resolved. I have credited him with mitigating this debt; however, I note the mechanism \nfor resolving this debt showed limited good faith. \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were harmed by his separation from his spouse, the necessity \nto establish two households, his payments of $4,000 on average monthly in support, and \nhis son\u2019s illness. These are circumstances largely beyond his control. He does not receive \nfull mitigating credit under AG 20(b) because he did not establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially \narose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge \ncould still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and \nattempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant did not provide \ndocumentary evidence that he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nApplicant noted that he was waiting for the statute of limitations to run in March \n2020 to address his debts. In ISCR Case No. 17-01473 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) \n(quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2011) (internal citations \nomitted)), the Appeal Board stated: \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitation, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been either charged off or may be \ndropped from his credit report or both. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit \nreport is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The \nFair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit \nreport seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection \nbarred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act \nUpdates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-\nreporting-act.pdf. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors \nbelieve the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit \nreporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been charged off.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007) (internal citation omitted) \n(mitigating security concerns despite garnishment to pay debt because of other financial \nefforts), the Appeal Board explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [this mitigating condition] an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s \ndebts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d However, the \nBoard has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a showing that \na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more \nthat show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or the statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of \n[these mitigating conditions]. \n \nBefore Applicant\u2019s $1,200 monthly garnishment started, and after his garnishment \nwas completed, and according to the income and expenses he described to the OPM \ninvestigator, he had about $1,000 monthly available to address his SOR debts. He had \nthe ability to address at least one of the seven unresolved SOR debts. Applicant did not \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nprovide documentation relating to any of the seven SOR debts such as: (1) proof of \npayments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter \nfrom the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of \ncredible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he \ndid not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence \nof attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to \nshow that he was attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or \nresolution.  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to \nmake greater documented progress resolving any of the seven debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d and 1.f through 1.h totaling $45,781. There is insufficient assurance that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish \nmitigation of financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old systems data analyst employed by a DOD contractor \nsince July 2009. From 1993 to 2009, he served on active duty in the Navy, and he \nreceived an honorable discharge. In 2018, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is \ncurrently separated from his spouse, and she has custody of their four children. He \ndescribed circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. There \nis no evidence of workplace misconduct or criminal conduct. He did not provide copies of \nperformance evaluations or character references.    \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is substantial. Applicant did not \nprovide documentation about why he was unable to make greater documented progress \nresolving seven delinquent SOR debts totaling $45,781. There is no evidence of progress \n(payments or payment plans) in the last three years of these seven delinquent debts. His \nlack of financial actions raises unmitigated questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to \nmitigate financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 19, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 25, 2020, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s \nwritten case was submitted on March 3, 2020. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \n\n \n2 \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on March 13, 2020. Applicant responded to the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM (FORM Response) on April 2, 2020. The case was assigned to \nme on April 28, 2020. The Government\u2019s documents identified as Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1 through 3 are admitted in evidence without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.f and denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g to 1.i. I construe her lack of a specific admission or denial to SOR \u00b6 2.a as \na denial. (Answer) \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. As of her Answer, she was single and did not have any \nchildren. She graduated from high school in June 2011 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin May 2018. She has worked as a systems engineer for a defense contractor since \nAugust 2018. She has never held a security clearance. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant recreationally used: (1) marijuana, with varying frequency, from June \n2008 to October 2018; (2) ecstasy, 10 to 20 times, from June 2011 to July 2018; (3) \ncocaine, with varying frequency, from January 2014 to July 2018; and (4) LSD in \nNovember 2017. She first used marijuana in high school, at age 15. She continued to \nuse marijuana in high school, from ages 15 to 18, approximately four times monthly with \nfriends. In college, from ages 18 to 22, she used marijuana daily to four times a week, at \nparties or friends\u2019 homes. During her latter years in college, from ages 22 to 25, she \nused marijuana between 10 to 48 times a year. In 2018, at age 25, she smoked \nmarijuana approximately 20 times. She used marijuana in October 2018 while attending \na college homecoming game. She approximated in her August 2018 security clearance \napplication (SCA) that she smoked marijuana \u201cwell over 1000\u201d times in total. Between \nOctober 2012 and July 2015, she purchased marijuana from a friend \u201cpretty frequently,\u201d \napproximately 30 times, for her personal use. (GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first use of ecstasy in 2011, at age 18, was at her high-school prom. \nShe subsequently used ecstasy during the weekends from 2011 to 2018 at friends\u2019 \nhomes, music festivals, or during trips to state A. She used ecstasy in July 2018 at a \nmusic festival. (GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first use of cocaine in 2014, at age 21, was with a friend at a college \nparty. From 2014 to 2015, she used cocaine four times monthly during the weekends at \ncollege parties or concerts. From 2015 to 2018, she used cocaine two to three times \nyearly at music festivals. She used cocaine in July 2018 during a weekend trip to state \nA. Between April 2016 and May 2018, she purchased cocaine twice for a music festival \nand a few other times while consuming alcohol. She attributed her purchase of cocaine \nto being \u201cyoung and dumb.\u201d She stated in her SCA and during her background interview \nthat she did not intend to use cocaine again because she did not like the next-day side \neffects and she did not want to risk her job. Applicant\u2019s one-time use of LSD in 2017 \nwas at a concert with a friend.   (GE 1, 2) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant stated in her SCA that she intended to use marijuana in the future \nbecause \u201c[i]t\u2019s not illegal in [state B--the state in which her family resides] and I enjoy \nthe effects of THC.\u201d She also stated that she would \u201cmost likely use [ecstasy] again if I \ngo to another music festival\u201d and she \u201cmight take LSD at a music festival.\u201d She stated \nduring her January 2019 background interview, however, that she no longer wanted to \nuse illegal drugs. She also stated that she had no future intent to purchase marijuana or \ncocaine. She stated that her motivation to stop using and purchasing illegal drugs was \nher employment. She acknowledged during her interview that she still associated with \nthe individuals with whom she previously used illegal drugs. In January 2020, Applicant \nsigned a statement of intent to not use any illegal drugs or abuse any prescription drugs \nin the future. (Answer; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant received an award from her employer in December 2019 for excellent \nperformance. Her first character reference, her boyfriend whom she met in 2018 \nthrough mutual work friends, described her as extremely reliable and a serious \nemployee. He stated that he held a security clearance and he was aware of the SOR \nallegations. He wrote: \n \n[Applicant] moved very far away from the people and places which were \nassociated with her past indiscretions with drugs and is in a completely \ndifferent environment which doesn\u2019t promote that sort of behavior. I have \nnever see that type of behavior nor do I think it will recur based on her \ndedicated work ethic. \n \n(Answer) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second character reference is a friend of two years and a U.S. \nmilitary veteran who previously held a security clearance. He stated that he and \nApplicant became friends through his wife, whom Applicant met at work, and they \nsocialize frequently for dinner or game nights. He stated that Applicant did not truly \nunderstand the seriousness of a security clearance until after she moved to state C and \nbegan working for her current employer. He described her as a career-oriented, \nresponsible, and trustworthy individual. (Answer)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n\n \n4 \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . .\u201d; \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and \n\n \n5 \n \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \n \nApplicant used marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, and LSD, at various occasions \nbetween 2008 and 2018. She purchased marijuana between 2012 and 2015, and \ncocaine between 2016 and 2018, for her personal use. She also stated in her SCA that \nshe intended to use marijuana in the future and she would also likely use ecstasy and \nLSD again. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged during her background interview that she still associated \nwith the individuals with whom she previously used illegal drugs. As such, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are not established.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement primarily occurred while she was in high school and \ncollege, and before she began working for her current employer. Her last use of any \nillegal drug occurred in October 2018 and her last purchase of any illegal drug occurred \nin May 2018. There is no evidence that she has since used or purchased any other \nillegal drug or misused any legal drugs. Her maturity is further demonstrated by her \nstatement during her background interview that she no longer intended to use or \npurchase illegal drugs, and her motivation to stop using and purchasing illegal drugs \nwas her employment. She also signed a statement of intent to not use any illegal drugs \nor abuse any prescription drugs in the future. Both of her character references attested \nto her trustworthiness and stated that she learned the seriousness of a security \nclearance since working for her current employer. Her employer awarded her excellent \nperformance in 2019. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(3) are established. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:       \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline H analysis, the evidence \nis sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e) and 16(e)(1) as disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline H analysis, I find that \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are established as to SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the drug involvement and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/11/2020 \nDecision \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 1, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 21, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on February 4, \n2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 5. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. Items 1 through 5 \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. He served in the military from 1993 to 1996. He earned \nan associate\u2019s degree in 2001 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He first married in 1993 \nand divorced in 1996. He remarried in 1998 and divorced in 2008. He remarried in 2009. \nHe has two children, ages 9 and 2, and an 18-year-old stepchild. Applicant worked for \nemployers from 1999 to 2010, and from 2010 until he started his present employment in \nFebruary 2019. He did not disclose any periods of unemployment on his April 2019 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA). (Item 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts ranging from $23 to $4,291, totaling \napproximately $24,742. The debts are corroborated by an April 2019 credit report and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and statements. (Items 3, 4, 5) \n \nApplicant disclosed to a government investigator, during his June 2019 \nbackground investigation, that his financial problems were due to a divorce, job loss, and \nnot earning enough income. He also stated he fell behind on bills when his son was born. \nHis son was born in 2010. His daughter was born in 2017. He also stated his financial \nproblems began in 2015, but did not elaborate. He told the investigator that he planned \nto hire someone to help him resolve his debts. He indicated he would attempt to contact \na debt consolidation company. He has not received financial counseling. Applicant did \nnot provide evidence of any action he may have taken to resolve any of the SOR debts. \n(Item 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that have not been paid or resolved. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant admitted he owed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He did \nnot provide evidence of efforts to resolve these debts. I am unable to conclude that \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubts on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a divorce, unemployment, and the \nbirth of his son. His last divorce was 2008. His son was born in 2010. He did not disclose \nany period of unemployment on his SCA. He also stated that his financial problems began \nin 2015, but failed to elaborate. Regardless, it has been ten years since his divorce and \nson\u2019s birth and five years since he stated he began to experience problems. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He did not provide evidence of action he may have taken to \nresolve any of his debts, including some that are small. AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application, \nand AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply as he has not established payment plans for any of the \ndebts. There is no evidence he has received financial counseling or has followed through \nwith obtaining the services of a debt consolidation company. There are no clear \nindications that Appellant\u2019s delinquent debts are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. He failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The \n\n \n2 \n \n \nevidence included in the FORM is identified as Items 2-5 (Item 1 includes pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on \nFebruary 24, 2020. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit any evidence or file \nobjections to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 2-5 are admitted into evidence without \nobjections. The case was assigned to me on May 12, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, with explanations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.o).

As for the remaining debts, Applicant stated that he had a budget plan to stay \nfinancially sound, but again he did not provide any documentation supporting the \nexistence of such a plan. He also claimed a foot injury affected his ability to work. He \ndid not provide details about the injury or documentation as to how it impacted his work \nschedule. Applicant presented no evidence of taking other action to pay or otherwise \nresolve the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved. (Items 1-3, 5). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid or unresolved. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. Applicant presented some evidence that the debts were due to circumstances \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbeyond his control (a foot injury causing impact on his ability to work). He did not \npresent evidence showing that he has taken responsible action to resolve his debts. I \nfind AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. Applicant made an unsupported claim that his \nwages are being garnished to pay his student loans. Even if that is so, payment through \ngarnishment does not equate to making good-faith efforts to pay a debt because of the \ninvoluntary nature of garnishment. He failed to provide documentation showing any \nefforts to make voluntary payments on the listed debts. There is no evidence he \nobtained financial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s medical \nissue that affected his ability to work. However, he also failed to present documentation \nshowing any payments toward his debts. Applicant has not established a track record of \nfinancial stability.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.q: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017. \nOn January 7, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On August 10, 2010, another administrative judge was \nassigned the case. On March 30, 2020, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the \nhearing on March 30, 2020. The hearing was cancelled on March 18, 2020, as a result \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 10, 2020, \nrescheduling the hearing for September 15, 2020. The case was transferred to me on \nSeptember 15, 2020, because of the unavailability of the assigned administrative judge. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled.

The cited sources contain more \nspecific information.) \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from January 2014 to July 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1 at 43-44; \nGov 2 at 8) \nHe is alleged to have purchased and distributed marijuana between \nJanuary 2014 and July 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 8) It is alleged that Applicant told \nthe investigator conducting his background investigation that he intends to continue to \npurchase and distribute marijuana. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 8) Applicant was arrested in \nOctober 2014 and charged with possession of marijuana. (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 1 at 40-41; \nGov 2 at 7; Gov 3; Gov 5). Finally, Applicant was arrested in July 2016 and charged \nwith possession of marijuana. (Gov 1 at 41-42; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 4; Gov 5). Applicant \npled guilty to both offenses. \nApplicant was issued a citation for possession of \nmarijuana, a misdemeanor offense, during both incidents. He was not arrested. \nThe police officer involved in the October 31, 2014, incident summarized the \nevents leading to Applicant\u2019s citation for possession of marijuana in a police report. He \nstopped a car driven by Applicant\u2019s girlfriend for speeding. Applicant was a passenger in \nthe car. Once the window was rolled down, the police officer noticed a strong smell of \nfresh marijuana coming within the vehicle. He told Applicant and his girlfriend that he \nwas going to search the car for marijuana and asked them to step out of the car. Fresh \nmarijuana wrapped in white paper was discovered in an open compartment by the \ndashboard. Five partially smoked marijuana cigarettes were found inside the ash tray by \nthe dashboard. Applicant and his girlfriend were separately read their Miranda rights. \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend said that she does not smoke marijuana but Applicant does and \nsmokes in the car with his friends. She said all of the marijuana in the car belonged to \nApplicant. After being read his rights, Applicant admitted that all of the marijuana in the \ncar belonged to him. He was issued a summons for possession of marijuana.

When he walked into the store, a police \nofficer who was outside the convenience store near Applicant\u2019s car smelled a strong \nodor of marijuana coming from Applicant\u2019s car. When Applicant exited the store, the \nofficers asked Applicant if the car belonged to him. They told him that they smelled a \nstrong smell of marijuana coming from his car. They told him they were going to search \nhis car based on probable cause. Applicant became upset and told them they did not \nhave probable cause to search the car. The car was searched and a plastic bag of \ngreen leafy plant material was found in the center console. The green leafy plant \nmaterial tested positive as marijuana. The marijuana was confiscated and Applicant was \nissued a summons for possession of marijuana. (Gov 4 at 6-7)  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d \nand 1.e. He clarifies his answer to SOR \u00b6 1.a by indicating he used marijuana off and \non between 2014 and 2015. He denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c because \nhe claims he never distributed marijuana and \u201cwould never say a statement like that.\u201d \n(Response to SOR, dated January 7, 2020) \nPersonal Conduct \nUnder the Personal Conduct Concern, the SOR cross alleges the allegations \nlisted under the Guideline H, Drug Involvement Concern. In addition, the SOR alleges \nunder the Personal Conduct Concern that Applicant falsified material facts during his \nbackground investigation interview on July 18, 2018; by stating: \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b)  that he used marijuana from January 2014 to February 2014, \nwhen he used marijuana at least from January 2014 to July 2016; \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c) that he was not using marijuana when he was cited for \npossession of marijuana in October 2014; and \n(SOR \u00b6 2.d) that he was not using marijuana when he was cited for \npossession of marijuana in July 2016. \nOn April 30, 2018, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) also known as a security clearance application. In \nresponse to questions in Section 22, Applicant listed his two citations for possession of \nmarijuana in 2014 and 2016. In response to questions in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of \nDrugs or Drug Activity, Applicant estimated that he used marijuana between January \n2014 and July 2016, in the amount of \u201c7-10 times total.\u201d (Gov 1, sections 22 and 23, at \n40-44) \nOn July 18, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator who was \nconducting his security clearance background investigation. The investigator \nsubsequently prepared an unsworn summary of the interview. Regarding his October \n2014 arrest for possession of marijuana, Applicant told the investigator that he claimed \nthe marijuana in the car was his to protect his girlfriend. \nApplicant also said the \nmarijuana joints were left behind in the car by someone else.

He purchased the marijuana for a \nfamily member. (Tr. 41-42Gov 2 at 6-7) \nApplicant told the investigator that he smoked marijuana between January 2014 \nand February 2014, on average of one to two times per week. He does not know why \nhe listed the last date of marijuana use on paperwork as July 2016. He told the \ninvestigator that he occasionally purchased marijuana for friends and family members \nwhen requested. He is aware that it is illegal to purchase and possess marijuana in the \nstate where he resides. He told the investigator that he intends to continue to purchase \nmarijuana for family and friends when requested.  (Gov 2 at 8) \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Department Counsel sent Applicant \na set of interrogatories. The interrogatories attached a summary of Applicant\u2019s July 18, \n2018, interview with the investigator conducting his background investigation. Applicant \nwas told to read the summary of the interview. He was given an opportunity to point out \nany inaccuracies in the summary of the interview. Applicant acknowledged that the \nsummary of the interview was accurate. He swore (or affirmed) that he read the \nenclosed report of his July 18, 2018 interview and that he found the report to be \naccurate or that he amended the report to make it accurate. He signed the document \nbefore a notary on October 2, 2019. (Gov 2) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he never distributed marijuana. He \nsaid he used marijuana \u201con and off\u201d from 2014 to 2015. He again stated that when he \nwas charged with possession of marijuana in 2016, the marijuana was not his. He was \ncharged because it was found in his car. (Tr. 19) Applicant also admitted during the \nhearing that he used marijuana during the 2014 arrest for marijuana possession. He \nadmitted that marijuana was his and not his girlfriend\u2019s. (Tr. 44-46) \nRegarding his July 2016 arrest for marijuana possession, Applicant testified that \nhe did not use marijuana in 2016. He claims he was charged with possession of \nmarijuana because no one else admitted ownership of the marijuana. He has \noccasionally purchased a small amount of marijuana for a family member. He did not \nbelieve that purchasing marijuana for a family member was considered marijuana \ndistribution. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the only time he purchased marijuana for \na family member was in July 2016. He purchased about $20 worth for his cousin. (Tr. \n45-49, 52) \nLater in the hearing, Applicant claimed that he did not use marijuana in 2015. \nApplicant testified that his last day of marijuana use was in October 2014. He has not \nassociated with people using marijuana for several years. His marijuana use was \nrecreational. He does not have a drug problem.

The \nSOR alleged 11 delinquent accounts that were placed for collection, an approximate \ntotal balance of $13,149. This was, in large part, the result of low-paying jobs. The SOR \nalleged 11 delinquent accounts to include: a $950 cable television account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 9; Gov 7 at 1); a $682 medical account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 9; Gov 6 at 4; Gov 7 at 2); a $542 satellite television \naccount placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 7 at 2); a $429 medical account placed \nfor collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 7 at 2); a $729 student loan account that was placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 7 at 2); and a $6,166 debt owed after an automobile \nrepossession (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 6 at 2-3). \nAdditional delinquent debts include: a $293 cell phone account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 1 at 51; Gov 2 at 9; Gov 6 at 5; Gov 7 at 4); a $1,023 cable \ntelevision account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 6 at 4); a $1,159 cell phone \naccount placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 2 at 9; Gov 6 at 4); a $617 satellite \ntelevision account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 6 at 4); and a $550 debt placed \nfor collection (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 1 at 51-52; Gov 2 at 9; Gov 6 at 5). \nApplicant obtained good employment in 2018. From 2018 to early 2020, he \nearned about $41,000 a year. His current annual income is $44,000. (Tr. 22, 27) In early \n2018, Applicant began working with a credit counseling group to help him repair his \ncredit and to settle accounts. He stopped working with them a few months before the \nhearing because he felt they were working too slowly. He decided to pay off the debts \non his own. (Tr. 27-29; Gov 2 at 8). Applicant said all of his debts were paid off. The \nrecord was held open after the hearing to provide Applicant the opportunity to provide a \ncopy of his agreement with the credit repair firm; a copy of his budget, a copy of receipts \nor other documentation which proved the debts were paid, and a copy of his most \nrecent credit report. (Tr. 17-18, 55-57) \nThe status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 3.a: $950 cable television account placed for collection: Applicant denies \nthis debt. He claims it has been paid. He was going to provide proof of payment after \nthe hearing. He did not provide proof of payment. (Tr. 30) \nSOR \u00b6 3.b: $682 medical debt placed for collection: Applicant denies this debt. \nHe claims it was paid. The October 2019 credit report indicated that the debt was being \ndisputed. \nApplicant did not provide further evidence indicating that the debt was \nresolved. (Tr. 30; Gov 7 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 3.c: $542 satellite television account placed for collection: Applicant \ndenies this debt.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \n \n  \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d  \n  \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana.  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24:   \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \nAG & 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG & 25(c)\n \n illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana on various occasions \nbetween 2014 \u2013 2015. He admits to receiving citations for possession of marijuana in \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 2014 and October 2016. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant \ndistributed marijuana on occasion to friends and family members. AG & 25(a) and AG & \n25(c) apply. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG & 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because four years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last \ninvolvement with marijuana. Applicant has matured and no longer uses marijuana. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies. Applicant stopped using marijuana in 2016. He no \nlonger associates with people who use marijuana. Although he sold marijuana to friends \nand family members in the past. He no longer does this. It does not appear that he sold \nmarijuana for profit. This mitigating condition is given less weight because he did not \nprovide a signed statement of intent to refrain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. \nOverall, Applicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement because of his lengthy abstinence from using marijuana. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes. \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or \nmental health professional involved in making a recommendation \nrelevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other \ngovernment representative; \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nAG & 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct , that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if know, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant made numerous conflicting statements regarding his marijuana use. \nOn his security clearance application, he stated he used marijuana from January 2014 \nto July 2016, a total of seven to ten times. During his security clearance background \ninvestigation interview in July 2018, he said he used from January 2014 to February \n2014, on average of one to two times per week. In his response to the SOR, he \nadmitted that he used marijuana \u201coff and on\u201d between 2014 and 2015. He testified the \nsame during the hearing. \nWhile Applicant admits his citations for possession of marijuana on October 31, \n2014, and July 13, 2016, he denied the marijuana belonged to him. Police reports \nindicate that on both incidents, the attending police officer smelled a strong odor of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana coming from the car that Applicant was in which gave them probable cause to \nsearch his vehicle. Applicant told the investigator conducting his background \ninvestigation interview in July 2018, that he claimed ownership of the marijuana during \nthe October 2014 arrest in order to protect his girlfriend. Regarding both arrests, \nApplicant told the investigator that marijuana did not belong to him, even though \nmarijuana was located in his vehicle. During the hearing, Applicant testified that he used \nmarijuana on the day he was cited for possession of marijuana in October 2014 and that \nthe marijuana belonged to him. He still maintains he did not use marijuana on the date \nof his July 2016 citation for marijuana possession. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s minimization of the extent of his \nmarijuana use (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and his denial that he used marijuana on the day of his \nOctober 2014 citation for marijuana possession (SOR \u00b6 2.c) to the investigator \nconducting his background investigation interview. Applicant\u2019s conflicting statements \nindicate that he deliberately withheld material facts from the background investigator. \nHe later affirmed the investigator\u2019s summary of what occurred during the interview was \naccurate. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.d because there is not sufficient \nevidence to conclude Applicant used marijuana on the day of his July 2016 citation for \nmarijuana possession. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana involvement, and his \nconflicting statements about his marijuana involvement. Applicant\u2019s past conduct raises \nissues about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. This raises doubts as to Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information. \nAG & 16(e) applies because Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use and involvement \nhas the potential to affect his personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \nAG & 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s conflicting statements \nregarding his marijuana use and involvement raise questions about his trustworthiness \nand reliability. A person entrusted with classified information must be reliable and have \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ngood attention to detail. \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent statements during his security \nclearance background investigation raises questions about his trustworthiness and his \nability to protect classified information. Personal Conduct Security Concerns are not \nmitigated. \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial \ndistress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a \npossible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern \nsuch as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in \nillegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence \nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. The disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case \ninclude: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. He incurred 11 \ndelinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $13,149. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and  \n19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. \nBehaving irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a \nperson may behave in other aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his \ncreditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an \ninability or unwillingness to pay debts under agreed terms. Absent evidence of \nstrong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of \nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent with \nthe holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating \ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions \npotentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or \nidentity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a \nnon-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control: and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing. Applicant did provide proof that most of the debts alleged in the SOR \nhave been resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was \nadversely affected by his periods of underemployment. These circumstances \nwere beyond Applicant\u2019s control and adversely affected his ability to pay his bills. \nHowever, this mitigating condition is given less weight because Applicant has not \ndemonstrated he acted responsibly under the circumstances. While Applicant \nclaims he resolved all of the debts alleged in the SOR, he failed to provide proof \nthat each debt was resolved. For this reason AG \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not take a formal financial \ncounseling course. The majority of his debts remain unresolved. \nAG & 20(d) applies towards the $429 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, \nbecause Applicant provided proof that he resolved this account. He failed to \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovide proof that he was making a good-faith effort to resolve the other accounts \nalleged in the SOR even though he was given close to four weeks after the \nhearing to provide this information. Applicant has not demonstrated a good-faith \neffort towards resolving his delinquent debts. Applicant has not met his burden of \nproof to provide mitigating concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI find Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H because it has \nbeen more than four years since he last used marijuana. However, Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent statements about his past marijuana use raise concerns about his \ntrustworthiness and reliability. Even if it were not deliberate, his lack of attention to detail \nraises issues about his ability to handle and protect classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide proof that he paid off or is making consistent \npayments towards the debts alleged in the SOR, prevents me from mitigating the \nsecurity concerns under Financial Considerations. Applicant did not demonstrate he is \nmaking a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nillegal marijuana use are mitigated. Concerns are not mitigated under personal conduct \nand financial considerations. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b, 2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a -3.c, 3.e-3.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 27, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal \nconduct) and F (financial considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on April 8, \n2020, and requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on May 6, 2020. A complete copy \nof the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on May 22, 2020. He responded with a \nletter that I have marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to me on \nJuly 9, 2020. The Government exhibits included in the FORM and AE A are admitted in \nevidence without objection.  \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since May 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from \n1986 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2008. He deployed to Iraq from \n2004 to 2005. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree that he earned in 2004. He is married with \ntwo adult children. (Items 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He was granted a security \nclearance in 2007, with a warning that \u201cfailure to resolve [his] delinquent debts or other \nsubsequent unfavorable information may result in the suspension of [his] security \nclearance.\u201d1 He was also \u201cstrongly advised to avoid any further incidents of failure to \npay debts that [he] legally incurred.\u201d The memorandum with the warning notice is \naddressed to Applicant through his command, but there is no documentation in \nevidence that Applicant acknowledged receipt of the memorandum. (Items 4, 9) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his recent financial problems to a period of unemployment \nfrom November 2015 to May 2016. He had his military retirement, unemployment \ncompensation, and a part-time job officiating at sporting events, but he was unable to \npay all his bills. (Items 2, 3; AE A) \n \n  \nThe SOR alleges a mortgage loan that was $26,293 past due, with a $354,777 \nbalance; a $23,159 charged-off auto loan; nine miscellaneous delinquent debts; and a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy case. Three of the delinquent debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, and 1.j, are \nduplicate accounts. When two of the duplicate accounts are eliminated from the nine \ndelinquent debts, there are seven miscellaneous debts totaling about $4,750. Applicant \nadmitted owing all the financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant stated during his February 2019 background interview that he was \nworking on a modification to his mortgage loan. The October 2017 credit report \nindicates the loan was $19,015 past due, with a $336,444 balance, and in foreclosure. It \nalso indicates that Applicant had made arrangements with the lender to make partial \npayments. The April 2019 credit report indicates the loan had been modified under a \nfederal government plan. However, it also indicates that the loan was $26,293 past due, \nwith a $354,777 balance, and a date of last action of March 2018. The May 2020 credit \nreport indicates the loan was $44,712 past due, with a $370,148 balance, and a date of \nlast payment of September 2018. (Items 3, 5-7) \n \n \nApplicant was current on the auto loan in 2017. The October 2017 credit report \nindicates the loan was opened in September 2014 for 74 months at $674 per month. \nThe high credit was $28,445, and the balance was $22,318. The April 2019 credit report \nindicates the loan was charged off with a high credit of $20,893 and a $23,159 balance. \nThe date of last action was June 2018. The May 2020 credit report indicates the loan \n                                                          \n1 The SOR did not allege financial issues in 2007. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be \nused for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial \nsituation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nwas charged off for $20,893. It lists an actual payment of $674, and a date of last \npayment of August 2019. The balance on the loan was $20,227. (Items 5-7) \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in March 2019. The case was \ndismissed the same month for failure to file all the required documents. Applicant stated \nthat he did not continue the bankruptcy process because he felt that he could address \nhis finances on his own. He indicated that his credit score does not determine the kind \nof person he is and how hard he worked to provide for his family. He asserted that he \nplanned to pay his debts, and that he was on track to restore his credit score. He did not \nindicate what he was doing to correct his financial issues. Some of the debts are not \nlisted on the most recent credit reports. Except for the limited payments that are \ngleaned from the credit reports and discussed above, there is no evidence of any actual \npayments toward the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 5-8; AE A)  \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJuly 2017. He did not report any adverse information under the financial questions. He \ndenied intentionally providing false information about his finances. He stated that his \nwife handled the family\u2019s finances, and with the exception of the mortgage loan, he was \nunaware that the debts alleged in the SOR were delinquent. He stated that he did not \nthink about the mortgage loan when he completed the SF 86. (Items 2, 3) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted mortgage and \nauto loans, and other delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, and 1.j are duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is \nalleged more than once in the SOR under the same guideline, the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j are concluded for Applicant. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case that was filed and dismissed \nthe same month. The bankruptcy case does not raise security concerns that are \nindependent of the security concerns that are already alleged in the SOR. SOR \u00b6 1.l is \nconcluded for Applicant. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from November 2015 to May 2016. That was beyond \nhis control. He had his military retirement, unemployment compensation, and a part-\ntime job officiating at sporting events, but he was unable to pay all his bills. The auto \nloan did not become delinquent until 2017 or 2018, so it is difficult to ascribe that to his \nunemployment. \n \n \nApplicant made minimal payments toward the debts alleged in the SOR. He \nasserted he planned to pay his debts. However, intentions to resolve debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant did not report any adverse information under the financial questions on \nhis July 2017 SF 86. He denied intentionally providing false information about his \nfinances. He stated that his wife handled the family\u2019s finances, and with the exception of \nthe mortgage loan, he was unaware that the debts alleged in the SOR were delinquent. \nHe stated that he did not think about the mortgage loan when he completed the SF 86. \nThe auto loan was not delinquent when he completed the SF 86. There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that Applicant intentionally provided false information about his \nfinances on the July 2017 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s many \nyears of honorable military service, including his deployment to Iraq. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, but he did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since August 2018. He served in the U.S. military from 1989 until \nhe was honorably discharged in 1999. He is married for the second time. He has three \nadult children. (Items 3, 4) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid federal income \ntaxes, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, repossessed vehicles, and delinquent debts. He \nattributed his problems primarily to maintaining two households while he worked in a \ndifferent state than his wife, leaving a good-paying job to move to another state to help \nhis daughter who was suffering from depression, and helping his mother and other \nfamily members financially. He moved from State A to State B in 2014 for a better job, \nwhile his family remained in State A. He moved back to State A to help his daughter in \n2016. (Items 2-8) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case; approximately \n$26,000 in back federal income taxes; and 11 delinquent debts totaling about $46,000. \nApplicant admitted all the allegations except the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \n($697), 1.j ($525), and 1.l ($155), which he asserted were paid. The three disputed \ndebts are listed on the most recent credit report in evidence, which was obtained in May \n2019. Applicant did not submit any documentation to corroborate his statements that the \ndebts were paid. (Items 2, 7, 8) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in December 2014. \nUnder Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $213,195 in \nsecured claims, which included a mortgage loan and four vehicle loans. Under \nSchedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed debts of \n$26,000 to the IRS for back taxes and $3,300 in attorney\u2019s fees. The petition listed \ndebts totaling $50,881 under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority \nClaims. The IRS filed claims totaling about $42,000 against the bankruptcy for back \ntaxes, penalties, and interest. The IRS claimed Applicant\u2019s wife owed $2,989 for tax \nyears 2006 and 2007, and Applicant owed the remainder for tax years 2008 and 2010 \nthrough 2013. (Items 2-8) \n \n \nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed in April 2016 for failure to make \nthe plan payments. Applicant and his wife paid a total of $24,036 into the plan, but none \nof the taxes or other unsecured debts were paid. The trustee and Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy attorney received $5,388. The remainder was paid to secured claims such \nas the mortgage arrearage ($5,118) and a vehicle loan ($13,529). (Items 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition indicated that he was on a payment plan with the \nIRS. (Item 5) He reported his bankruptcy, tax issues, and delinquent debts on an August \n2018 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He wrote the following as \nthe reason for the tax problems: \u201cChange in employment due to family issues. My \nmarriage was in shambles so we moved back to [State A] and the reduction in income \ncaused me to default on my installment plan with the IRS.\u201d (Item 3) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant told the background investigator in November 2018 that he was on a \n$700 per month installment plan with the IRS, and the payments were automatically \ndeducted from his bank account. In his December 2019 response to the SOR, he wrote \nthat he had been on a monthly \u201cinstallment plan for 12 months and [had] not missed a \npayment.\u201d (Items 2, 4) \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as a requirement of his bankruptcy. (Item \n5) He indicated in his response to the SOR that he was working with several of his \ncreditors on settlements. He did not provide any corroborating documents about his \ntaxes or his debts, and he did not respond to the FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n4 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid federal income \ntaxes, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, repossessed vehicles, and delinquent debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems primarily to maintaining two \nhouseholds while he worked in a different state than his wife, leaving a good-paying job \nto move to another state to help his daughter who was suffering from depression, and \nhelping his mother and other family members financially. Those conditions were mostly \nbeyond his control. His tax issues were not beyond his control. \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018).  \n \n \nApplicant wrote in his December 2019 response to the SOR that he had been on \na monthly installment plan with the IRS for 12 months and had not missed a payment. \nHowever, he wrote in his August 2018 SF 86 that he had defaulted on an installment \nplan, and he told the background investigator in November 2018 that he was on a $700 \nper month installment plan with the IRS, and the payments were automatically deducted \n\n \n6 \n \nfrom his bank account. He failed to document an installment plan or any payments to \nthe IRS.  \n \nApplicant made assertions about paying other debts, but he did not provide \ndocumentation. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect \napplicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at \n3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). Additionally, he stated that he was working with several of \nthe creditors on settlements. However, intentions to resolve debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to pay his taxes and \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s unpaid federal taxes and delinquent debts are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 7, 2019. \nOn December 6, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 8, 2020, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \non January 28, 2020. On that same day, a complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5, was sent to Applicant, \nwho was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n\n \n2 \n(DOHA) transmittal letter is dated January 28, 2020, and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated \nFebruary 13, 2020. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days \nafter receiving it to submit information. He did not file a response. The DOHA transmittal \nletter and receipt are appended to the record as Administrative Exhibit (Admin. Ex.) 1. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 12, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges nine credit-card debts totaling $21,171. In his \nAnswer, Applicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.a, an $885 charged-off account, and admits the \nremaining debts. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s April 2019 credit \nbureau report (CBR), disclosed on his e-QIP, and discussed during his personal subject \ninterview (PSI). (GX 5; GX 3; GX 4.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.   \n \nApplicant, 35, is the deputy director of client services currently working for a \ndefense contractor since 2017. He received his associate\u2019s degree in 2006. He married \nin 2007 and divorced in 2008. He resides and shares expenses with his cohabitant. This \nis his first application for a security clearance. (GX 3; GX 4.)  \n \nApplicant states that his financial delinquencies are due to living beyond his means \nwhen he was younger, a period of reduced hours of employment, and an overall lower \nincome at the time the debts were incurred. (GX 3; GX 4.) \n \n In his Answer, Applicant\u2019s basis for denying SOR \u00b6 1.a is that the debt does not \nappear on his January 2020 CBR. He does not state that he paid the debt, nor did he \nprovide a copy of the CBR. Without evidence to establish otherwise, SOR \u00b6 1.a is not \nresolved.  \n \nApplicant further states in his answer that he has contacted the creditors of the \nremaining eight accounts and is attempting to arrange for repayment plans. He provides \ntelephone numbers for each of his points of contact, but does not provide any other \ninformation. He does not assert nor is there any evidence that he has made any payments \non any of these accounts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.i are not resolved. \n \nDuring his PSI, Applicant explained that, in an effort to rebuild his credit, he has \nincurred recent debt, which he timely pays. This includes a November 2018 purchase of \na $41,431 vehicle jointly with his cohabitant - with monthly payments of $875, a credit \ncard, a furniture purchase, and a jewelry purchase. Applicant stated he intended to repay \nhis delinquent accounts after paying off his current accounts by September 2019. He \nplanned to contact the creditors of the smallest delinquent accounts in an effort to reach \nsettlement agreements. He further stated that he and his cohabitant split all expenses, \nand that he has a net monthly remainder of between $830 and $1,330 and a savings \naccount of approximately $5,000. (GX 4; GX 5.) There is no evidence that Applicant has \nparticipated in any financial counseling. \n \n\n \n3 \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n \n4 \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \n \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent, ongoing, and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts may have been incurred, in part, due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. Specifically, he experienced periods of reduced work hours and low-paying \nemployment. However, he did not act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nwas given notice that the Government was concerned about his financial issues, first \nwhen he answered questions regarding his delinquent debts on his February 2019 e-QIP, \nand again when he answered questions about those accounts during his May 2019 PSI. \nHe received the December 2019 SOR that sets forth the financial considerations security \nconcern and lists nine delinquent debts totaling over $21,000.Yet, despite having a \nmonthly net remainder of between $830 and $1,330, he has not made a single payment \non any of his delinquent accounts.  \n\n \n5 \n \nAlthough Applicant is current on his recently incurred debt, he remains legally \nobligated to pay his significant delinquent debt. His failure to do so raises concerns about \nhis willingness to abide by rules and regulations, and about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Applicant did not provide any evidence of any resolution of or recent \nactions he has taken to resolve his ongoing delinquent accounts. He has not participated \nin any financial counseling. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \n \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nsignificant delinquent debt. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

On \nDecember 12, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant \nanswered (Answer) the SOR on January 17, 2020, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. \nOn April 30, 2010, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining eight items, was mailed to Applicant. He received the FORM on May 8, 2020. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant responded to the FORM in a timely manner on May 26, 2020, and he submitted \nAppellant Exhibits (AE) A and B.

He was self-employed from 2014 until April 2016, when he went \nback to work for his former employer as a designer/drafter. (Item 4; Item 5, AE A) \nThe SOR alleges two consumer debts totaling $51,238. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted the $50,757 home equity line of credit (HELOC) and denied the $481 \ncredit card debt. He provided explanations and documentation. (Item 3) \nIn June 2006, Applicant purchased a home and opened a HELOC to make repairs \nto the house. He made interest-only payments toward the HELOC until approximately \nSeptember 2015, when the account was sold to another creditor. The new creditor \nrefused payments, and Applicant was told by the original creditor to wait to make \npayments until he was contacted by the new creditor.

(Item \n5 at 1-2; Item 6 at 3; AE A) \nOn January 30, 2020, Applicant and his wife entered into a forbearance agreement \nto make $200 monthly payments from January 30, 2020 through December 30, 2020, \ntoward the HELOC debt. His credit reports reflect that the balance was reduced from \n$51,399 in January 2017 to $50,757 in July 2019 and to $50,557 in April 2020. These \nbalances demonstrate that he made additional payments before the 2020 payment \nagreement. In his May 2020 response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation \nthat he made five timely $200 payments between January and May 2020, in accordance \nwith the agreement. (Item 3, Item 6, Item 7, Item 8, AE B) \nApplicant provided proof that he paid in full the $481 credit card debt in January \n2020, and his most recent credit bureau report reflects that it has been resolved. It \nappears that he made payments toward this debt between January 2017 and July 2019 \nas the delinquent amount decreased from $581 to $481.

(Item 3; Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 3; Item 8 at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s April 2020 credit bureau report reflects no new delinquent debts. There \nis no record evidence of credit counseling. (Item 8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant resolved one of the alleged debts and is in a payment plan for the other \nalleged debt. He has no other new delinquent debt and is able and willing to resolve his \nfinancial obligations, as demonstrated by his payments on his outstanding debt. The \nrecord evidence does not indicate that Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his debts was the result \nof circumstances beyond his control; therefore, mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) was not \nestablished; however, mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) was established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, it is clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Esq. \n06/02/2020\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concern generated by his delinquent \nfinances. Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations explaining why it was unable \nto find it clearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance eligibility. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On December 27, 2019, Applicant answered \nthe SOR, admitting the allegations. He requested a decision without a hearing. On January \n29, 2020. Applicant received a copy of the FORM on February 7, 2020, and was instructed \n\n2 \n \nto file any objections to this information, or to supplement the file within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant did not do so, whereupon the case was assigned to me on April 16, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old single man with one child, age seven. Applicant was \nmarried from 2012 to 2016. The marriage ended in divorce. (Item 3 at 21) He graduated \nfrom high school in 2008 and he joined the U.S. Marine Corps two years later, serving \nthrough 2014 when he was honorably discharged (Item 3 at 21) Applicant has been \nworking for a federal contractor since August 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred ten delinquent debts totaling $44,000, as alleged in the SOR. \nApproximately $42,000 of this debt constitutes a delinquent personal loan ($14,197), as set \nforth in subparagraph 1.a, and a delinquent car loan (28,036) as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.b. Applicant provided no evidence that he has arranged payment plans to \nsatisfy these debts, and he provided no evidence that he has either satisfied, or has been \npaying through payment plans, any of the remaining debts. \n \n \nApplicant contends that he first began struggling with his finances after leaving the \nmilitary in 2014, and that he lost control of his finances when he lost his job in 2018 after \nhis employer accused him of falsifying mileage reimbursement records. Applicant disputes  \nthis allegation, but did not provide evidence that he officially disputed it through his state\u2019s \nadministrative agency with jurisdiction to adjudicate such matters.  \n \n, totaling $28,000 to a car loan company that repossessed his  car in 2018.  \n \n \nSince 2017, he has possessed legal guardianship of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s child. (Tr. 64) He \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in 1970 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1979. (GE 1 at 13) Since \nFebruary 2016, he has been working for his current employer, a federal contractor, as a \nsenior safety engineer. (Tr. 29)  According to a former coworker who worked with Applicant \nin the 1990s, Applicant was \u201calways responsible in all matters related to protecting \nclassified material and would diligently follow all rules and protocols to ensure the \nprotection of classified material.\u201d (AE D at 1) \n \n \nApplicant has incurred approximately $90,000 of delinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems began when he was laid off from his job in April 2015 as part of a \nreduction in force. (GE 1 at 7) He was subsequently either unemployed or underemployed \nfor the remainder of that year. Despite having $100,000 invested in a stock portfolio, \nApplicant exhausted these funds and fell behind on his debt payments. (Tr. 64) His \nfinances became delinquent in part because he chose to neglect them in order to help his \nex-girlfriend and her three children financially, providing them with several hundred dollars \nper month while he was unemployed. (Tr. 63-64; GE 2 at 18)  \n \n \nApplicant regained full-time employment in February 2016. He then retained a debt \nconsolidation agency to help him resolve his debts. (Tr. 16) As part of the agreement, the \n\n3 \n \ndebt consolidation agency agreed to contact each creditor, negotiate balance reductions, \nand develop repayment plans. (Tr. 16) Also as part of their agreement, Applicant was to \nmake monthly payments to the debt consolidation agency, and was not to negotiate with \nany of the creditors himself. (Tr. 16-17)   \n \n \nThe debt consolidation agency did not fulfill its responsibilities under the agreement, \neither not contacting all of the creditors, as promised, or not making the agreed-upon \npayments. (Tr. 18) In 2017, Applicant terminated his agreement with the debt consolidation \nagency and began attempting to resolve the debts himself.  \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.a is a credit card account totaling $16,947. In October 2019, \nApplicant negotiated a balance reduction and a payment plan. (AE E at 18) Under the plan, \nhe was to begin making $353 monthly payments, beginning in November 2019, \napproximately six weeks after the hearing. (AE E at 18) \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.b totals $14,913. Applicant disputes this debt, contending that \nhe has been unable to contact the creditor, or identify the type of debt. He suspects it was a \nhome equity line that was satisfied when he sold a home in 2017. (AE T at 3; Tr. 19) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c is a credit card, totaling $11,580. At the hearing, Applicant denied \nresponsibility for this debt. However, during the post-hearing record extension deadline, \nApplicant confirmed his responsibility for the debt, and developed a payment plan. Under \nthe plan, Applicant was to begin making monthly $323 payments, beginning in October \n2019. (AE Q at 1) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e are credit card accounts owed to the same creditor, \ncollectively totaling approximately $15,000. Applicant negotiated a settlement of \nsubparagraph 1.d for $2,644 and a settlement for subparagraph 1.e for $1,842. According \nto the two separate agreements, he was to have begun satisfying subparagraph 1.d with \n$440 payments, and subparagraph 1.e with $307 monthly payments, on November 20, \n2019. (AE H \u2013 AE I)  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f is a credit card totaling approximately $6,639. Applicant arranged \nto satisfy this debt in $350 monthly increments that were to have begun on November 23, \n2019. (GE L) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g is a delinquent credit card account totaling $3,541. Applicant \nsatisfied this account through a wage garnishment in September 2019. (AE E at 10) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h totals $3,174. It was charged off and reported \nas income to the Internal Revenue Service in tax year 2018. (AE J) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i is a collection agent for a department store. Applicant\u2019s debt \nallegedly totals $2,359. Applicant contests the payoff amount, contending that it is actually \n$1,829. (AE T at 9) The collection agent filed suit against Applicant. Subsequently, he \n\n4 \n \nretained an attorney who successfully moved for dismissal of the case for defective service \nof process. (AE T; AE U at 9)    \n \n \nThe creditor in subparagraph 1.j is a collection agent for a department store. The \ndelinquency totals $1,298. Applicant has been satisfying this debt in monthly $106 \nincrements since February 2019. (AE M) \n \n \nThe creditor in subparagraph 1.k is a collection agent for a department store. The \ndebt totals $1,144. Applicant denied this debt, contending that he satisfied it. He provided \nconfirmation of satisfaction in his post-hearing submissions. (AE P) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l totals $15,082. Applicant admits owing money \nto this creditor, but disputes the amount, contending that the debt had been paid down to \n$5,892. Further, he contends that the collection agency\u2019s \u201cbusiness had been halted on a \nlegal challenge of improper debt manipulation, which included this account.\u201d (AE U at 10) \nHe provided no documentary evidence in support of this contention. \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m, as duplicated in subparagraph 1.n is a delinquent cable \ntelevision bill totaling $321. (AE U at 11) Applicant satisfied this debt. (AE K at 1) \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.o is a bill for the security system at Applicant\u2019s late mother\u2019s home. \nApplicant denies this bill, contending that as the trustee of her estate, he was not personally \nliable for her debts. (Tr. 27) Nevertheless, he paid this debt. (AE U at 11)  \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.p alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2015 and 2016 on time. He attributes this failure to his continuing \nstruggles to get out of debt after obtaining his current job in February 2016. (Tr. 29) \nApplicant filed both returns in March 2018. He owed no income taxes for either year. (AE A \nat 32-37) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q and 1.r allege that Applicant failed to file state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016 for three states where he lived during that period. Applicant \ndenied these allegations. He lived in two states (State 1 and State 2), relocating to State 2 \nafter losing his job located in State 1 in August 2015. SOR subparagraph 1.q alleges that \nhe failed to file the 2015 income tax returns for State 1 and State 2. Applicant filed these \nincome tax returns in March 2018. (Tr. 29; AE A, Attachments (Att.) 9, 10) He failed to file \nthem on time, citing the same reason for failing to file his 2015 and 2016 federal income tax \nreturns on time. Ultimately, he was entitled to a $286 refund from State 1 (AE A, Att. 9), and \nowed no money to the revenue authority of State 2. (AE A, Att. 9 at 1) \n \n \nApplicant lived in State 2 from August 2015 to December 2015. (AE U at 12) When \nhe obtained his current job in January 2016, he relocated from State 2 to the state where \nhe currently lives. (State 3) Applicant had no responsibility to file an income tax return in \nState 2 for 2016 because he did not live there that year.  \n \n\n5 \n \n \nApplicant has not yet filed his State 3 income tax return for 2016, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.s. With the help of a professional tax return preparer, he completed it in \nMarch 2018; however, he did not file it then because of what he alleged to be a discrepancy \nin the amount owed. Specifically, the return, as completed by the preparer, indicates that \nApplicant owes State 3 $3,178, whereas, Applicant contends that he is owed a refund. (AE \nA, Att. 11 at 3; AE U at 12) Applicant contends that dispute is being investigated. He \nprovided no evidence of any investigation.  \n \n \nApplicant maintains a budget. (GE 2 at 19) He earns $113,000 per year. (Tr. 55) He \nreceives $352 in monthly pension payments stemming from two previous jobs. (GE 2 at 9) \nHe has $1,650 in monthly disposable income.  \n \n \nApplicant has received between 17 and 20 traffic citations in the past 7 years. Many \nof the tickets stemmed from driving an automobile with expired registration. Specifically, \nwhen Applicant relocated from State 2, he took with him two vehicles that he owned. (Tr. \n38) The registration for one of the vehicles had expired. Struggling to make ends meet, \nApplicant only registered one vehicle after relocating. Most of the time, he left the \nunregistered vehicle parked on a private driveway, legally off the streets of State 3. \nOccasionally, however, if the registered vehicle was broken down and he did not have the \nmoney to repair it, he would drive the unregistered vehicle instead. (Tr. 37; GE 2 at 10) \nPeriodically, while driving the unregistered vehicle, he would get stopped and ticketed. \nApplicant received the majority of these tickets for driving an unregistered vehicle while \ncommuting to and from work. (Tr. 37, 99) He prioritized work attendance, preferring to \noccasionally commute with an unregistered vehicle, over paying to register his vehicle. (Tr. \n37) The cost for registering a vehicle in State 3 is approximately $150 per year. (Tr. 102) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s traffic citations include fines for driving with an expired driver\u2019s license. \nWhile living in State 2, Applicant was stopped and issued citations for operating a car \nwithout a valid registration and without a valid driver\u2019s license in 2015. (GE 2 at 10) As a \nresult of these citations, his vehicle was impounded. Applicant obtained a temporary \nregistration, but did not apply for a new driver\u2019s license. He failed to do so because he \ncould not afford the registration fee. (GE 2 at 10) \n \n \nLater in 2015, Applicant applied for unemployment benefits. When completing the \napplication, he forgot to disclose his monthly pension income. ($352) Upon realizing his \nmistake, he contacted his caseworker and disclosed the pension income. The caseworker \ntold him that it was nominal, and would have no effect on the amount of unemployment \ncompensation that he would receive. (Tr. 46) When Applicant obtained his part-time job \nlater that year, he did not report the income to the unemployment office. Consequently, he \nwas charged with the crime of misrepresentation of income to obtain unemployment \nbenefits.  (Tr. 92) As part of a settlement, Applicant was ordered to pay $4,000 in \noverpayment expenses. (Tr. 93) \n \n \nApplicant contends that he did not report the money from the part-time job because \nthe income was nominal, similar to the pension income that he was told that he did not \nneed to report. During cross-examination, he testified that the overpayment totaled slightly \n\n6 \n \nmore than $4,000, an amount \u201cmuch more than the payments that [he] got from [his ex-\nemployer].\u201d (Tr. 94) He disclosed his failure to report the part-time income and its \nconsequences, vis a vis his unemployment benefits, in depth on his 2017 security \nclearance application.   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n\n7 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s outstanding income tax debt owed to State 3 for 2016 triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant was either unemployed or underemployed for ten months in 2015. Before \nthen, he had no financial problems. When Applicant lost his job, he had rainy day income \ninvested in a stock portfolio totaling $100,000. He admittedly could have done a better job \nof keeping his debts under control while unemployed, but deliberately chose to neglect \nthem in favor of supporting his ex-girlfriend and her children, paying them hundreds of \ndollars per month during his unemployment. Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial problems stemmed from circumstances beyond his control. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is inapplicable.   \n \n \nApplicant provided proof supporting his contention that the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b was satisfied when he sold his home in 2017. Although the evidence is \nnot conclusive, it constitutes a reasonable basis for the dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the \ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.b, and I resolve it in his favor. \n       \n \nShortly after regaining full-time employment in February 2016, Applicant retained a \ndebt consolidation company to help him identify and pay his delinquencies. The company \nneither complied with their agreement, nor returned Applicant\u2019s deposit, prompting him to \nterminate their agreement in 2017. Since then, he has contacted creditors and satisfied the \ndebts in subparagraphs 1.k and 1.m as duplicated in 1.n. He has been making payments \ntowards the satisfaction of subparagraph 1.g since February 2019. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. I \nresolve subparagraphs 1.g, 1.k, and 1.m, as duplicated in 1.n, in his favor. \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h, totaling $3,174, was charged off and reported \nto the IRS. As such, it generates no ongoing vulnerability to coercion. I resolve \nsubparagraph 1.h in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant does not dispute the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i, he \ncontends that the amount alleged delinquent is wrong, has retained an attorney, and is \nactively litigating the dispute. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.i, and resolve it in his favor.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he owes approximately $10,000 less than the amount \nalleged in subparagraph 1.l ($15,082) is unsupported by documentary evidence. Similarly, \nhis contention that he is no longer responsible to complete debt satisfaction because the \ngovernment suspended the debt because of deceptive lending practices, is unsupported by \ndocumentary record evidence. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to subparagraph 1.l, and I \nconclude that it remains outstanding. \n \n \nApplicant satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.o. I resolve this allegation in \nhis favor. \n \n\n9 \n \n \n Although Applicant has entered payment plans to resolve the remainder of the \nconsumer debts alleged in the SOR, no payments were scheduled to begin until a month \nafter the hearing. Given the amount of this debt, it is too soon to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation is under control.  AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns and his income tax \nreturns for State 2. I resolve subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q in his favor. Subparagraph 1.r \nalleges that Applicant failed to file 2016 income tax returns for State 2 and State 3. \nApplicant had no duty to file a tax return for State 2 because he did not live or work there \nthat year. Applicant prepared his 2016 State 3 tax return, but did not file it because the \nreturn indicates that he owes $3,178, an amount he disputes. He provided no documentary \nevidence establishing that he filed a formal dispute with the state taxing authority. Currently, \nit continues to remain unfiled. I conclude that Applicant owes the delinquency, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.s, and that it remains outstanding. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(g) \nis only partially applicable. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \n \n \nSeventeen to 20 traffic citations received over a seven-year period constitutes an \naverage of approximately two to three traffic citations per year. Although this is not an \nexcessive number of traffic citations, it is the circumstances surrounding the receipt of \nthese citations rather than their frequency which generates a security concern. Specifically, \nApplicant testified that several of these tickets were for driving a vehicle that he did not \nregister with the state motor vehicle authority because he could not afford the fee, and that \nrather than keeping it off the road, he periodically drove it when his registered vehicle was \nbroken down, prioritizing his daily job attendance over the legal responsibility to register the \nvehicle. Under these circumstances AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not \nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information,\u201d \napplies to subparagraph 2.a. \n \n \nThe personal conduct adjudicative guideline also addresses deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. (AG \u00b6 16(a)) Applicant failed to disclose \n\n10 \n \nto State 1\u2019s unemployment security compensation authority part-time income that he was \nearning while receiving unemployment compensation, leading to the criminal charge of \nmisrepresentation to obtain unemployment benefits.  \n \n \nApplicant testified during direct examination that he did not disclose his part-time \nemployment income because he thought it was minimal, like his pension, which was not \nrequired to be reported. On cross-examination, however, he acknowledged that his part-\ntime income was much more than his monthly pension payments. Given this contradictory \ntestimony, I conclude Applicant\u2019s explanation for not reporting the part-time income to the \nunemployment compensation authority was not credible. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) applies \nwithout mitigation. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant deserves credit for disclosing this episode on his security \nclearance application, his subsequent, unbelievable explanation at the hearing renders the \napplication of any of the mitigating conditions inapplicable. I conclude that Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decisions to drive an unregistered vehicle, rather than pay for its renewal, \nand his failure to disclose part-time income while receiving unemployment benefits \nepitomize the type of conduct that individuals may engage in if financially distressed. \nMoreover, any presence of rehabilitation is overshadowed by the unresolved tax debt and \nthe fact that most of the payment plans were not scheduled to begin until after the close of \nthe record. These concerns, combined with the intentional omission of relevant financial \ninformation to the state unemployment compensation authority, compel me to conclude that \nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest at this time to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n11 \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j \u2013 1-k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m \u2013 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 25, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines the \nDoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 16, 2020, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record., in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received \nthe File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 3, 2020, and interposed no objections to \nthe materials in the FORM. He did not supplement the record.  \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly is indebted to the Federal Government for \na tax lien entered in 2012 for the approximate amount of $52,063. (Item 1) Allegedly, \nthis tax lien remains unresolved and outstanding.  \n \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly failed to disclose the federal tax lien \nentered against him in 2012 in the electronic questionnaire for investigations processing \n(e-QIP) he completed in June 2017. By failing to disclose the federal tax lien in his \nexecuted e-QIP, Applicant allegedly deliberately falsified his e-QIP.  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations of indebtedness \nwith explanations, but denied falsifying his 2017 e-QIP. He claimed he has a tax firm \nworking to resolve his federal tax dispute over an imposed federal tax lien whose \nenforcement will expire in August 2020. Applicant further claimed that he has continued \nto dispute any federal tax liability for the alleged tax covered by the imposed federal tax \nlien and misunderstood the question posed to him in the 2017 e-QIP he executed.  \n(Items 2 and 7)   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor who seeks \na security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \n \nBackground \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1996 and divorced in May 2009. (Items 3-4) He has \nthree children from this marriage (ages 20, 17, and 15). He remarried in October 2012 \nand has five stepchildren from this marriage (ages 39, 28, 18, 15, and 12). (Items 3-4) \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2005. Applicant reported no military \nservice. (Items 3-4) Since February 2007, Applicant has been employed as a \nmultidiscipline system engineer lead by his current defense contractor. (Items 3 and 4)  \nHe reported no prior employment, and he has held a security clearance since 1990. \n(Item 4). \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \n \nIn December 2012, Applicant incurred a $52,063 federal tax lien. (Items 5-7) He \ndisputes the merits of this lien that covers delinquent taxes owed on a $3,000 charitable \ncontribution he made to his church in 2003 with funds withdrawn from his 401(k) \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nretirement account. (Item 7)  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) declined to credit \nApplicant with a non-taxable donation because it found the church beneficiary to be not \nproperly structured for eligibility under Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)3) to receive non-taxable \ndonations.  (Item 7)  \n \nSection 501(c)(3) tax exemptions apply to entities that are organized and \noperated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes. \nWhere applicable, the IRS provides a deduction for federal income tax purposes for \nsome donors who make charitable contributions. Being denied a tax exemption for \nreasons not fully detailed by Applicant, he has continued to dispute the IRS\u2019s declination \nto treat his donation as a non-taxable contribution and claims enforcement of the lien \nwill expire in August 2020. (Item 2) Currently, the aggregate of Applicant\u2019s federal tax \nliability is $52,063, inclusive of cumulative penalties and interest. (Items 5-7)  \n \nApplicant recently engaged a tax consultant to address his incurred 2012 tax lien. \n(Items 2 and 7) To date, he has reported no success  with his IRS negotiations and has \nprovided no documentation of his ongoing efforts to address and resolve the tax lien \nissue. Because of his failure to provide any supporting documentation of his resolution \nefforts with the IRS, little debt resolution credit can be extended to Applicant. So, while \nhe remains committed to addressing the documented tax lien, he has provided no \nupdates on his IRS negotiations, or evidence of financial counseling or budgeting. \n \nE-QIP omissions \n \n \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in June 2017, Applicant omitted the federal tax lien \nentered against him in 2012 in the space provided in section 26 of the e-QIP. (Item 3) \nHe attributed his omission to his misunderstanding the question in the face of his \nongoing dispute with the IRS over his church\u2019s entitlement to 501(c)(3) status. \nPreviously, he omitted any information about tax delinquencies in the e-QIP he \ncompleted in August 2007 for a public trust position. (Item 4) Applicant provided no \nexplanations for why he omitted this tax information in both e-QIPs.  \n \n \nWhat communications Applicant exchanged with the IRS between 2003 and \n2012 is unclear. For he provided no details of any disputes he initiated with the IRS over \nhis church donation in 2003, or why he elected to omit his $3,000 federal tax debt in the \ne-QIP he completed in 2007. Whether he was ever interviewed by an OPM agent \nfollowing his submission of his 2007 e-QIP is also unclear. Without more information \nfrom Applicant as to why he omitted (a) the $3,000 tax debt he incurred with the IRS in \nhis 2007 e-QIP (with explanations or comments if disputed) and (b) the ensuing tax lien \nentered against him in 2012 in his 2017 e-QIP (with explanations or comments if \ndisputed), drawn inferences of candor lapses cannot be averted.  \n \nWhen questioned about any tax liens and delinquencies by an investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in October 2018, Applicant voluntarily \nacknowledged the 2012 tax lien without any prior confronting. In his interview, he \nprovided detailed information about the origins of the tax imposition in 2003 and ensuing \ntax lien entered against him in 2012 with added penalties and interest. (Item 7) His OPM \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \ndisclosures, while voluntary and by all evidentiary accounts made in good-faith, did not \ninclude any explanations for why he omitted the tax information in both of his prior e-\nQIPs.  \n \nAfforded an opportunity to explain any ongoing tax dispute with the IRS over his \nunresolved federal tax lie in the answers to interrogatories he submitted in July 2019,  \nApplicant acknowledged anew the delinquent $52,063 tax lien and confirmed the lien \nremained unaddressed and unsatisfied. (Item 5)  Claiming that IRS lien enforcement will \nexpire in August 2020 (Item 2), he offered no other tangible basis for disputing the lien \nor omitting it from his 2017 e-QIP. \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \n \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator \nof, other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive \ngambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse \nor dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n \n \n \n \n       Personal Conduct \n \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of conduct, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  .  .  . AG \u00b6 15. \n \nBurdens of Proof \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1.  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s incurred federal tax lien covering \ndelinquent federal taxes exceeding $52,000. Additional security concerns are raised \nover his omission of his 2012 federal tax lien in the e-QIP he completed in 2017. \n \nFinancial concerns \n \n. Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the application of three of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d: 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d Each of \nthese DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted federal tax lien negates the need for any independent proof. \nSee Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006) His \nadmitted federal tax lien is fully documented and creates some judgment issues. See \nISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies. \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \ncited continuing dispute of the federal tax lien entered against him in 2012 provides no  \nextenuating benefit.  Because Applicant has failed to provide any documented evidence \nof the basis of his federal tax dispute with the IRS over its denial of a \u00a7 501(c)(3) tax \ndeduction, or efforts to resolve his claimed dispute, mitigating credit cannot be extended \nunder any of the potentially available mitigating conditions.  \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of tax-related debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely \nresolution of such debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) In \nApplicant\u2019s case, he has failed to take any documented steps to address his federal tax \nlien that has remained in place since it was entered against applicant in 2012.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address the tax lien precludes him from receiving favorable \nfindings and conclusions with respect to raised security concerns over the state of his \nstill outstanding  tax lien.   \n \nPersonal conduct concerns \n \n \nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability \nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s inferred knowing and willful omission of the federal tax lien entered against \nhim in 2012. The lien covered an IRS tax delinquency incurred in 2003, which was not \ntangibly addressed by Applicant before it was converted to a tax lien. Applicant\u2019s stated \nexplanation of misunderstanding the question posed to him in section 26 of the e-QIP \nwas never adequately explained by Applicant to avert findings of candor lapses in \nomitting the tax lien from his 2017 e-QIP. So much trust is imposed on those cleared to \nsee classified  information that accommodations for breaches are necessarily calibrated \nvery narrowly. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 506, 511n.6 (1980) Material \nbreaches of an applicant\u2019s disclosure responsibilities in a security clearance application \nare, in turn, incompatible with the high trust principles affirmed in Snepp. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 e-QIP omission invites application of one of the disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the personal conduct guideline. DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or ward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. Based on all of the information considered in connection with his omitted tax \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \nlien in the space provided in section 26 of the e-QIP he completed in 2017, candor \nlapses are reflected in Applicant\u2019s tax lien omission. \n \n \nAfforded an opportunity to correct his e-QIP omission in his scheduled 2018 \nOPM interview, Applicant provided a voluntary, good-faith disclosure of the federal tax \nlien entered against him without any prior prompting. While his disclosure of the \nfinancial details associated with the 2012 tax lien were not accompanied by any \nexplanations of why he omitted the information in the e-QIPs he previously completed,  \nhe is credited with making his disclosures when presented with his first interview \nopportunity to do so. He reaffirmed the entry of the federal tax lien entered against him \nin the interrogatory responses he provided in June 2019. Applicant\u2019s good-faith \ndisclosures entitle him to take advantage of an important mitigating condition (MC) of \nthe personal conduct guideline: MC 16(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d  \n \n \nBased on a consideration of the evidence in this compiled administrative record, \nallegations of falsification are mitigated. Applicant\u2019s good-faith corrections of his tax lien \nomission in his 2017 e-QIP enable him to overcome initial concerns about his overall \nhonesty and integrity. \n \nWhole-person assessment \n \n \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with the minimum standards  \nfor holding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his civilian contributions \nto the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his inability \nto resolve a major federal tax obligation that dates to 2003. His failure to resolve this \nmajor tax debt reflects adversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently \nstable manner to meet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n                Against Applicant \n \n        \n                  Guideline E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                FOR APPLICANT \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                        Subparagraph: 2.a:                                      For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 42, divorced his wife of five years in 2010. He has two children, ages 15 and 20. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an engineer since 2010. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance. (Item 3) Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 1994 through June 2017. He purchased marijuana for his use two times per year from 1996 through January 2016. He used hallucinogenic mushrooms on five to ten occasions between 1997 and June 2016. He used a topical ointment containing CBD derived from hemp on one occasion in May 2019. The record did not specify the THC content, if any, of the CBD ointment. Because this CBD use was not alleged in the SOR, I will consider it only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5; FORM response) Applicant did not report any CBD use in his November 2017 SCA or during his November 2018 security clearance interview (SI). The first time he mentioned it was in his November 2019 response to interrogatories (ROI). In reply to a question about using marijuana in the future, he responded \u201cNo\u201d with the following explanation: \u201cCBD helps anxiety, relaxation. If THC is legal [with respect to a DOD clearance] I would in the future. I don\u2019t use enough or depend on it that I need it. I don\u2019t miss it.\u201d The Government apparently construed this explanation as an \u201cexpress intent to use CBD products,\u201d as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In response",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on November 2, \n2017. On February 28, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline H. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 31, 2020, and requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On May 8, 2020, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including pleadings \nand evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 5. He was given an opportunity \nto submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence.

Items 3 through 5 are admitted into evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s FORM response included documents that are admitted into evidence as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. I sua sponte took administrative notice of several \nmatters, as discussed below, which I appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \nthrough III. The case was assigned to me on September 22, 2020. \nAdministrative Notice \nIn his FORM response, Applicant referenced guidance from the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA), dated December 2018, concerning the Agriculture \nImprovement Act of 2018. \nBecause neither party submitted a copy of this guidance, I sua sponte appended \nthe referenced guidance to the record as HE I. I also appended, as HE II and III, two \nrelated FDA documents for context. I sua sponte take administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in HE I through III including the following: \n1. Cannabis is a plant of the Cannabaceae family and contains more than \neighty biologically active chemical compounds. The most commonly known \ncompounds are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol \n(CBD). Parts of the Cannabis sativa plant have been controlled under the \nDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\u2019s Controlled Substances Act \n(CSA) since 1970 under the drug class \"Marihuana\" (commonly referred to \nas \"marijuana\"). \n2. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (AIA) (also known as the 2018 \nFarm Bill) was signed into law on December 20, 2018. \n3. Among other things, the AIA removed hemp, defined as cannabis \n(Cannabis sativa L.) and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low \nconcentrations of the psychoactive compound THC (no more than 0.3 \npercent THC on a dry weight basis), from the definition of marijuana in the \nCSA. \n4. Cannabis plants and derivatives that contain no more than 0.3 percent THC \non a dry weight basis are no longer controlled substances under federal \nlaw. \n5. Prior to the enactment of the AIA, the CSA did not differentiate between \nmarijuana and hemp, and all cannabis (with certain exceptions, e.g. \nsterilized seeds and mature stalks of the plant) was a Schedule I substance \nand therefore controlled by the DEA. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 42, divorced his wife of five years in 2010. He has two children, \nages 15 and 20. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001. He has been employed by a \ndefense contractor as an engineer since 2010. This is his first application for a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (Item 3) \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 1994 through June 2017. \nHe purchased marijuana for his use two times per year from 1996 through January 2016. \nHe used hallucinogenic mushrooms on five to ten occasions between 1997 and June \n2016. He used a topical ointment containing CBD derived from hemp on one occasion in \nMay 2019. The record did not specify the THC content, if any, of the CBD ointment. \nBecause this CBD use was not alleged in the SOR, I will consider it only to evaluate \nmitigation and the whole person concept. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5; FORM response) \nApplicant did not report any CBD use in his November 2017 SCA or during his \nNovember 2018 security clearance interview (SI). The first time he mentioned it was in \nhis November 2019 response to interrogatories (ROI). In reply to a question about using \nmarijuana in the future, he responded \u201cNo\u201d with the following explanation: \u201cCBD helps \nanxiety, relaxation. If THC is legal [with respect to a DOD clearance] I would in the future. \nI don\u2019t use enough or depend on it that I need it. I don\u2019t miss it.\u201d The Government \napparently construed this explanation as an \u201cexpress intent to use CBD products,\u201d as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In response to the alleged intent to use CBD in the future, Applicant \nwrote \u201cI admit ignorance\u201d and explained: \u201cI was unaware that CBD from Hemp is still \nconsidered a controlled substance. I did use this on one occasion and did not like the \nsleepiness and have not used this since May 2019.\u201d In his FORM response (FR), he \nasserted that in the ROI he meant to say: \u201cI would not use [CBD] in the future unless it \nwas made legal with respect to DOD\u2019s clearance protocol.\u201d He maintained in his SOR \nanswer (SA) and FR that he has only used CBD one time. Given the concerns about CBD \nuse expressed by the Government in the SOR and FORM, Applicant considers CBD use \nto be incompatible with maintaining a security clearance. (Items 2, 4; FR) \nApplicant described the circumstances of his drug use and his intent about using \ndrugs in the future at various stages throughout the security clearance process: on his \nNovember 2017 SCA; during his November 2018 SI; in his November 2019 ROI; in his \nMarch 2020 SA; and in his August 2020 FR. His descriptions varied as noted in the \nbulleted paragraphs below. In his FR, he affirmed generally: \u201cI have not and will not use \nthese illegal substances ever again.\u201d (Items 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant described the circumstances of his marijuana use as follows: \n\uf0b7 \u201cpain relief, socially/recreationally used 1-5x month\u201d (SCA) \n\uf0b7 used one to three times per month by himself and one to three times per \nmonth at parties or social gatherings; used for relaxation and to socialize \nbetter with others (SI) \n\uf0b7 \u201cby myself, with friends or acquaintances, small groups, 1-2 inhales\u201d (ROI) \n\uf0b7 \u201cI have used marijuana for pain relief and stress reduction when I was \nyounger.

From March \n2016 through November 2018, Applicant worked part-time for a company owned by \nFriend X. Applicant and Friend X used marijuana together on at least one occasion in \nJune 2017, which was Applicant\u2019s last use. He and Friend X used mushrooms together \non at least one occasion. (Item 3 at 15; Items 4, 5) \nDuring his 2018 SI, Applicant declared that nearly all of his close friends and \nassociates, including Friend X, used marijuana. In reply to a question in his 2019 ROI \nabout whether he continued to associate with individuals who use any illegal drugs, \nApplicant checked \u201cyes\u201d and did not elaborate any further. In his 2020 SA, he stated \u201cI do \nnot regard my friends as bad influences as they have been understanding and supportive \nof my desires to obtain [sic] clearance.\u201d In his 2020 FR, Applicant asserted that he does \nnot associate \u201cwith individuals who use marijuana regularly\u201d or \u201cwith anyone who has a \ndrug use problem.\u201d He further stated that: \nThe people I associate with have children, pay taxes, [sic] never been \narrested, and vote and participate in their communities. As an adult, I have \nchanged aspects of my life with respect to my selection of events I \nparticipate in and whom I go to places with, but I will never be ashamed of \nthe people I associate with . . . I do not and will not be around people or \nevents where substance abuse occurs. \nApplicant presented reference letters from four individuals who praised his work \nperformance, character, and trustworthiness. Of the four, one is a family friend who \nserves as a U.S. court of appeals judge; two serve as local county commissioners (one \nis also a work colleague, and the other knows him through his volunteer work); and one \nis the director of the government agency whose contract Applicant supports (who is also \na friend). None of these letters indicated that the individuals were aware of either \nApplicant\u2019s drug use or the SOR allegations.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd.

(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and mushrooms \nestablish two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nGiven the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, the following additional DC warrants some \ndiscussion: AG \u00b6 25(g) (expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse). It is \nuncontroverted that Applicant used CBD derived from hemp in May 2019. In his \nNovember 2019 ROI, Applicant did not expressly state that he either used CBD or would \nuse CBD in the future. A reasonable inference of an intent to use CBD in the future could \nbe drawn from his description of the substance as legal substance for medicinal purposes \nin his 2020 FR. Guidance about the 2008 Farm Bill indicates that a CBD product may not \ncontain enough THC to render it a controlled substance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe language Applicant used in his 2019 ROI (\u201cCBD helps anxiety, relaxation.

I don\u2019t miss it.\u201d) expresses an intent to use marijuana (not \nCBD) in the future. However, that is not what was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d so I cannot \nconclude that AG 25(g) was established. Accordingly, I find SOR \u00b6 1.d in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. Nevertheless, any equivocal statements in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s future \nmarijuana use, including any CBD product containing amounts of THC that render it a \ncontrolled substance, remain relevant to my mitigation and whole person analysis of the \noverall Guideline H concern. \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use spanned 23 years. He purchased marijuana for his use \ntwice a year for 20 of those years. Even on the lower end of his estimated frequency \n(once per month), he would have used it at least 276 times. He purchased it 40 times. \nAlthough his marijuana use began at age 16, he continued to use it as a mature adult for \nrecreational purposes. \nApplicant consistently affirmed that he has no intent to purchase marijuana in the \nfuture. However, he provided conflicting statements about his intent to use marijuana in \nthe future. He asserted in his FR that he had no such intent, but that statement falls short \nof a commitment to abstain in light of the record as a whole. At three different points \nduring the security clearance process prior to his FR, Applicant declared that he would \nuse marijuana in the future if it became legal or would not impact his security clearance. \nHe referenced his career as a motivating factor to abstain from marijuana. However, he \nhas been employed by the same defense contractor since 2010 and did not stop using \nmarijuana until four months prior to completing his 2017 SCA. He did not sign a statement \nof intent. While Applicant may no longer participate in events where he is exposed to drug \nuse or associate with persons that are using drugs in his presence, the record did not \nestablish that he no longer associates with drug-using friends. One of his security \nclearance references was a friend with whom he used drugs on more than one occasion. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to appropriately take responsibility for his illegal marijuana use. \nApprehension about the ability to gain and maintain a security clearance appears to \nunderlie his current abstinence from marijuana, rather than its illegality. Of particular \nconcern is the characterization of his marijuana use as medicinal, for the first time, in his \nFR. That equivocation not only undermines his credibility, but also the sincerity of his \ncommitment to abstain. Moreover, it was misplaced since medicinal marijuana use \nremains prohibited by federal law and incompatible with maintaining a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s use of mushrooms was relatively infrequent compared to his marijuana \nuse. Moreover, he consistently expressed an intent not to use it in the future. However, it \nremains security significant since it further underscores his inability to comply with laws \nover a significant span of time. He used it recreationally at least five to ten times during a \n19-year period, most recently at age 38. His denial of ever having made a statement that \nhe had previously affirmed about his mushroom use (that he used it \u201cto enhance his \nperception at a party or concert\u201d) further calls into question his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \nAccording to the record before me, Applicant used a CBD product one time in May \n2019 for unspecified \u201cmedicinal purposes.\u201d The fact that his CBD use occurred after he \nsubmitted his SCA would bear more significance if it contained THC in an amount that \nrendered it a controlled substance. However, the THC amount was neither alleged nor \nspecified in the record, and Applicant considered the CBD product to be legal based on \nhis research prior to use. Regardless of whether he used CBD that was a controlled \nsubstance, the ongoing security significance involves his failure to clearly articulate that \nhe would never use illegal CBD again. Although he neither clearly admitted to using CBD \nnor addressed his intent for using illegal CBD in the future in his 2019 ROI, he later \nreferred to the statement in his FR as if he had stated that his future CBD use would \ndepend on whether it was prohibited by \u201cDOD clearance protocol.\u201d Then, later in the same \nFR, he stated that he \u201cwill not use CBD again.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s extended history of using and purchasing marijuana alone renders him \nineligible to possess a security clearance. However, his mushroom use and the ongoing \nconcerns with his candor about the nature of his drug use underscore a pattern of \nquestionable judgment that further calls into question his ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations. It has been more than three years since he bought or \nused marijuana or mushrooms. However, he failed to meet his burden to establish \nmitigation sufficient to overcome his failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \nabstinence. I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s drug involvement is unlikely to recur \nand have significant doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the above factors. Applicant\u2019s character, work performance, and \ncommunity involvement were highly praised by several individuals who took the time to \nwrite letters on his behalf. However, I was unable to conclude that any of them were aware \nof either Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement or the SOR allegations. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his drug involvement. Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The Government also alleged that Applicant owed $26,001 for ten past- due or delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). Under Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately omitted from his August 2018 e-QIP the debts alleged in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j (SOR 2.c); and that during his PSIs on December 21 and 28, 2018, he falsely denied owing any delinquent debts until he was confronted with corroborating information about those debts (SOR 2.d). Also under Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately made a false statement when he failed to disclose in his e-QIP that, in April 2014, he was suspended from work for two weeks due to misconduct (SOR 2.a). Finally, the Government alleged Applicant made another false statement when, after failing to disclose his 2014 suspension in his e-QIP, he failed to disclose it during his December 21, 2018 PSI; and that it was not until he was confronted during a May 23, 2019 PSI that that he disclosed the suspension.

In response, Applicant did not present information sufficient to \nmitigate those security concerns. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 20, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. On December 21 and 28, 2018, and on May \n23, 2019, Applicant completed personal subject interviews (PSI) by government \ninvestigators as part of the background investigation initiated when Applicant submitted \nhis e-QIP.

The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited \nin the SOR were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, \nto be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on July 21, 2020, and convened the requested hearing on September \n3, 2020. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 14, 2020. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6, which I admitted without \nobjection. As to the PSI summaries presented in GX 2, Applicant made a knowing and \ninformed waiver of objection to its admissibility. (Tr. 17 \u2013 20) Applicant testified and \npresented Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B, which I admitted without objection. Also \nincluded in the record are Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 (Index of Government Exhibits) and \nHX 2 (Department Counsel\u2019s Discovery Letter, dated June 29, 2020). At the end of the \nhearing, I held the record open until September 11, 2020, to give Applicant time to submit \nadditional relevant information to support claims he made during his testimony (Tr. 94 \u2013 \n95); however, he did not submit anything further. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that in April 2003, Applicant filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition and was discharged of debts totaling $41,230 in August \n2003 (SOR 1.k). The Government also alleged that Applicant owed $26,001 for ten past-\ndue or delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j). \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately omitted \nfrom his August 2018 e-QIP the debts alleged in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j (SOR 2.c); and that during \nhis PSIs on December 21 and 28, 2018, he falsely denied owing any delinquent debts \nuntil he was confronted with corroborating information about those debts (SOR 2.d). \nAlso under Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately made \na false statement when he failed to disclose in his e-QIP that, in April 2014, he was \nsuspended from work for two weeks due to misconduct (SOR 2.a). Finally, the \nGovernment alleged Applicant made another false statement when, after failing to \ndisclose his 2014 suspension in his e-QIP, he failed to disclose it during his December \n21, 2018 PSI; and that it was not until he was confronted during a May 23, 2019 PSI that \nthat he disclosed the suspension.

In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old and has been employed in an information technology (IT) \nposition by a defense contractor for whom he has worked since October 2019. His \nprevious employer, for whom he worked between August 2018 and October 2019, \nsponsored his submission of an e-QIP in August 2018, and his current job requires \neligibility for access to classified information. In 1997, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering, and he has earned several IT certifications. (GX 1; Tr. 31) \nApplicant was married in May 2003, but divorced in May 2008. He has no children, \nand he currently rents a room at his brother\u2019s house for $1,000 a month. Shortly before \nhe married, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in which he declared $41,230 \nin unsecured debts against $3,820 in assets. Applicant testified he accrued those unpaid \ndebts by age 31 because he was \u201cyoung and reckless.\u201d Credit reports obtained by \ngovernment investigators and adjudicators in October 2018 and August 2019, \nrespectively, list the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j. Those debts became delinquent \nbetween 2012 and 2018. (GX 3; GX 4; GX 6; Tr. 71 \u2013 72, 89 \u2013 90) \nApplicant first received a security clearance in 1998 for defense contractor work at \na military installation. He testified that before submitting his most recent e-QIP, Applicant \nhad submitted as many as ten security clearance applications, and that he views a \nsecurity clearance to be \u201cas good as gold\u201d and \u201ca license to make money.\u201d Since 1998, \nhe has worked for multiple defense contractors in positions that required either a security \nclearance or eligibility for a public trust position. Between 2009 and 2014, he worked as \na government employee for a federal agency. That job required he meet certain \nproduction quotas during each performance appraisal period. In April 2014, Applicant was \nsuspended for two weeks for violating workplace policies, including failing to meet his \nquotas and keeping a work schedule outside of prescribed workday hours. Applicant did \nnot believe he was violating agency rules by working late evening to early morning hours; \nhowever, before being suspended he was counseled about the need to adhere to a core \nworkhours policy. He also was counseled about his failure to meet his production goals. \n(Answer; GX 2; Tr. 32, 36 \u2013 39, 44 \u2013 46, 72, 85 \u2013 86) \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose any of the \ndebts alleged in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j. He also did not disclose, as required by e-QIP Section \n13C (Employment Record), that he was suspended for two weeks from his federal \nemployment in April 2014. During his background investigation, he was interviewed on \nDecember 21, 2018. The investigator conducting the interview reviewed with Applicant \nthe answers on his e-QIP and Applicant confirmed, in relevant part, that his negative \nanswers in Sections 26 and 13C were correct. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2) \nOn December 28, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed about his finances. The \ninvestigator initially asked Applicant if he had any delinquent debts, and Applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d The investigator then confronted Applicant with credit report information \nthat documented several delinquent or past-due debts, including those listed in the SOR. \nApplicant claimed he omitted the debts from his e-QIP because of a \u201cmental lapse.\u201d At \nhis hearing, he testified that he did not disclose his debts because either he already had \npaid some of his debts on his own or he was repaying the rest through a debt \nmanagement plan (DMP) in which he had enrolled before he submitted the e-QIP. (GX 2; \nGX 3; Tr. 47 \u2013 49, 69 \u2013 71, 74 \u2013 76) \nSection 13C of the e-QIP requires disclosure of information about adverse \nworkplace actions in the preceding seven years; specifically, whether an applicant was \nfired, quit a job after being told he would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement after \nallegations of misconduct or notice of poor job performance, or had received a written \nwarning, official reprimand, suspended or otherwise disciplined for misconduct. Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to this inquiry rather than list the two-week suspension discussed above. \nIn listing a reason for his departure from his federal employment in 2014, he stated he \nresigned. During both of his December PSIs, Applicant failed to disclose his suspension \nwhile reviewing his negative answers in Section 13C. He again was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator on May 23, 2019, and he initially denied any adverse \nemployment history. After then being confronted with information about his suspension, \nhe acknowledged the incident and provided details about what had occurred. During the \nMay 2019 PSI, he did not provide any explanation about why he did not list the suspension \nin his e-QIP or why he did not disclose the information during either of his December 2018 \ninterviews. At his hearing, he acknowledged he left his government job in July 2014 by \nmutual agreement under adverse circumstances related to the underlying causes of his \nsuspension. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 36 \u2013 43, 93 \u2013 94) \nAs to Applicant\u2019s debts, during his December 28 interview, he stated that he fell \nbehind on his debts after being hospitalized. At his hearing, Applicant described being ill \nwhile working for the federal government. He testified that he suffered from unspecified \nintestinal problems which caused him to take time off without pay under the Family and \nMedical Leave Act (FMLA). However, he did not provide more detailed information about \nhis illness or how it impacted his finances. He has stated that he was unable to work \nduring his illness; however, available information shows that he has been consistently \nemployed, albeit at varying income levels, since at least 1998. Applicant averred that he \nhas paid several of his debts and that he has been repaying others through the DMP in \nwhich he enrolled just after he submitted his e-QIP in August 2018. A recent credit report \nhe presented at hearing shows many of his debts have been paid and closed; however, \nthey were closed by the creditor. The record contains no information directly showing \nactual payments by Applicant to resolve those debts. Put another way, the fact that a \ncredit report may list an account as paid does not mean Applicant resolved the debt. \nTaken together with the Government\u2019s credit reports, it appears many of Applicant\u2019s debts \nwere sold to collection agencies and may still be his responsibility. The question of proof \nof payment or resolution was raised at the hearing and Applicant averred he could \ndocument his claims that many of his debts had been paid. Despite having extra time \nafter the hearing to provide that information, Applicant has not presented anything further \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nto corroborate his claims. (Answer; GX 3 \u2013 5; AX A; AX B; Tr. 48 \u2013 65, 67, 75 \u2013 76, 92 \u2013 \n95) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n5 \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant omitted from his 2018 e-QIP relevant \nadverse information about his employment record and about his finances. He had \ncompleted numerous security clearance applications for various jobs since 1998 and was \nfamiliar with the requirement that he answer the government\u2019s questions truthfully. When \ninterviewed on two occasions by a government investigator about his employment record \nand his finances, Applicant would not disclose that information until being confronted with \ncredit reports and employment records. All of the record evidence probative of his state \nof mind when he completed his e-QIP and when he answered investigators\u2019 interview \nquestions shows that he knowingly and willfully tried to conceal relevant adverse \ninformation from the government. \nAll of the foregoing reasonably raises a security concern about personal conduct \nstated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nMore specifically, information supporting the SOR allegations requires application \nof the following AG \u00b6 16 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nBy contrast, I also have considered the potential applicability of following pertinent \nAG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. Applicant did not make prompt efforts \nto correct his omissions from his e-QIP, or to provide accurate information during any of \nhis three interviews. Instead, he persisted in his efforts to withhold information until he \nwas confronted with the facts of his debts and his suspension. Applicant\u2019s omissions from \nhis e-QIP and his false statements during interviews were not the result of advice from \nanyone, much less legal counsel or other authorized source. To the contrary, Applicant \napparently relies on the fact that, because of his long experience in completing multiple \nsecurity clearance applications over the last 20 years, his omissions must be viewed as \ninadvertent mistakes. That argument fails because of his repeated false statements \nduring interviews, and because his experience in submitting prior clearance applications \nestablishes a presumption that he knew he was required to provide answers that were \naccurate and complete to the best of his ability and recollection. All of the foregoing also \nshows that his conduct in this regard is not minor and that it casts doubt on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness and reliability. On balance, Applicant did not meet his burden of \npersuasion here, and the security concerns addressed under this guideline are not \nmitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nAs alleged in SOR 1.k, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 2003 to \nresolve $41,230 in delinquent debts he incurred because, in his early 30s, he was \u201cyoung \nand stupid\u201d and made bad financial decisions. Between 2012 and 2018, he was well into \nhis 40s and incurred another $26,001 in delinquent debt as alleged in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j. This \ninformation reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is \nexpressed, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the potential application of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 \nmitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply because available information about any \nfinancial counseling, particularly his DMP, is incomplete at best. He engaged in the DMP \nin 2018, but he has not shown that he has consistently been repaying his debts in a \nsystematic and reliable way, either through the DMP or otherwise. As to AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant has claimed that the debts addressed in the SOR arose when he was \nhospitalized and could not work. He testified that his illness arose while he was a federal \nemployee and that he had to take time off under the FMLA; however, he did not present \ninformation showing how any time off for illness impacted his finances. Applicant lost \nincome when he left federal employment in 2014 because of his own misconduct at work. \nEven assuming his illness constituted circumstances beyond his control, Applicant did not \nestablish that he acted responsibly in the face of those circumstances. His reliance on a \nrecent credit report does not suffice to show that he acted to pay or otherwise resolve the \ndebts listed as paid or closed. Most of them were closed by the creditor, and debts often \nare listed as paid when they have been purchased by a collection agency. When that \nhappens, it is incumbent on Applicant to show how the debt was resolved and that he is \nno longer responsible for it. Applicant\u2019s information does not adequately support his \nclaims that he has paid most of his debts, and when given time after the hearing to provide \nadditional information that would corroborate his claims, he did not do so. Finally, AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved and his failure to act \non those debts, despite the government\u2019s scrutiny of his financial problems, undermines \nconfidence in his judgment and reliability. \nThe security concerns about Applicant\u2019s financial problems have not been \nmitigated. I also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in \nAG \u00b6 2(d). Available information does not support application any of those factors. His \ndeliberate false statements, his employment history, and his debts still cast doubt about \nhis suitability for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of national \nsecurity is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved \nagainst the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s request for \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n1 \n \nOn January 10, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, a requirement of his employment with a defense contractor. Based on the \nresults of a background investigation initiated by his e-QIP submission, Department of \nDefense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine, as required by Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nfor Applicant to have a security clearance. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 18, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline D (Sexual \nBehavior) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in \nthe SOR were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge with the Department of Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On January 15, 2020, Applicant\u2019s counsel contacted Department Counsel and \nrequested, instead, that this case be decided based solely on the written record. On \nAugust 3, 2020, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department \nCounsel issued to Applicant a File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained \neight documents (Items 1 \u2013 8) on which the Government relied in making the SOR \nallegations. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 10, 2020. He timely submitted a written \nresponse thereto (FORM Response), which included a 24-page brief by Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel supported by 13 exhibits identified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 M. The record \nclosed on September 22, 2020, when Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nrebuttal to the FORM Response (Rebuttal) and waived objection to AX A \u2013 M. I received \nthis case for decision on October 14, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleged that on May 8, 2016, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with felony abduction with intent to defile; that on August 25, 2016, he \npleaded guilty to misdemeanor sexual assault, for which he was sentenced to 12 months \nof incarceration (four months suspended), placed on probation for two years, and ordered \nto complete a psychosexual evaluation and psychoeducational services (SOR 1.a). \n(FORM, Item 1) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested on June 28, 2017, \nand charged with violating the terms of his probation after failing to complete \npsychoeducational services; that he was found guilty of that charge on July 25, 2017; and \nthat he was sentenced to 120 days in jail, 110 of which were suspended (SOR 2.a). \nAdditionally, the conduct alleged at SOR 1.a was cross-alleged as criminal conduct (SOR \n2.b). (FORM, Item 1) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, all of the \nallegations. As to SOR 2.a, while he admitted that allegation, he proffered an affirmative \ndefense by averring that he appealed his conviction and the charge was dismissed in \nAugust 2018. (FORM, Item 2) In addition to the facts established through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a single, 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he \nwas worked as senior research engineer since December 2017. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in computer science in August 2011 and a master\u2019s degree in the same field in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 2015. Between June 2011 and November 2017, Applicant worked in information \ntechnology (IT) positions for a nationally-known defense contractor and for two other \nsmaller federal contractors. He has held a security clearance since at least 2011. His \nperformance while working for his current employer has been excellent, and through \nprofessional associations, social media and podcasts, he is active in networking, \nmentorship, and professional development of fellow engineers in his field. Applicant is \nalso active as a volunteer in various community organizations. (FORM, Items 1 and 2; \nFORM Response, AX D \u2013 F) \nOn the evening of May 7, 2016, Applicant was at a bar within walking distance of \nhis apartment. He went to the bar after consuming between five and seven alcoholic \nbeverages. Late in the evening, he encountered a woman who was obviously intoxicated. \nThe woman, who was an active duty member of the military, initially thought Applicant \nwas gay and decided to accept his offer to go to his apartment because she wanted to \nget away from two other men at the bar who had been trying to pick her up. The woman \naccompanied Applicant to his apartment with the understanding that they would just hang \nout and talk, and that the woman would sleep it off there. When they arrived, the woman \nbecame apprehensive after seeing a \u201cstripper pole\u201d was installed in the apartment. She \nasked where she should sleep and Applicant replied, \u201cIn my bed.\u201d She then tried to go to \nsleep on the couch, but Applicant later came out of the bedroom wearing only his boxer \nshorts and climbed on top of the woman (hereinafter, the victim) and started kissing her. \nWhen she was able to get off the couch, Applicant grabbed her and pushed her to his \nbedroom and onto his bed. Several times she tried to get away from him and he would \npush her back onto the bed. At one point, Applicant told the victim, \u201cyou know what I want \nand you\u2019re going to give it to me.\u201d Eventually, through physical force, the victim was able \nto get her things and leave the apartment. She was upset and disoriented (she did not \nknow the building\u2019s street address or Applicant\u2019s apartment number) because of her level \nof intoxication, but she was able to get help at another apartment two floors down from \nApplicant\u2019s and called the police to report that Applicant had tried to rape her. (GX 6; \nFORM Response, AX C) \nWhen the police arrived, they met the victim at the apartment two floors down from \nApplicant\u2019s where the victim had sought help. The police observed that she was very \nintoxicated. She could not remember precisely which apartment she had been in, so the \nofficers decided to take her to a common area on another floor and continue interviewing \nher there. As an elevator arrived to take the victim and two police officers to that floor, \nthey encountered Applicant in the elevator and the victim recognized him. The police then \nbegan talking to him, eventually taking the victim and Applicant to Applicant\u2019s apartment, \nwhere they continued speaking to the parties separately. Information gathered by the \npolice that evening included statements from both Applicant and the victim, and \nphotographs of bruises and red marks on the victim consistent with having struggled as \nshe described, including a scratch on her thigh when Applicant tried to lift up her skirt. \nAdditionally, the police noted that Applicant gave conflicting statements about what \nhappened, changing his version of events when confronted with certain aspects of the \nvictim\u2019s claims. For example, Applicant could not explain why the sheets on the bed were \nmessed up. He initially stated that the victim went into the bedroom and sat on the bed, \nbut that he brought her out to the couch. He also denied he and the victim did anything \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the bed but sit there side by side. Additionally, Applicant knew the victim was highly \nintoxicated and stated that intoxicated women, such as the victim, were \u201ceasy targets\u201d or \nwords to that effect, meaning that it was easier to get them to have sex. In response to \nthe FORM, Applicant averred that he was misunderstood, stating: \nWhat I was trying to convey was that I was describing her as an \u2018ideal \npartner\u2019 \u2013 because she was attractive to me and she, from what I gathered, \nwas interested in me. In fact, to support my belief that she was interested in \nme, [the victim] willingly accompanied me to my residence. (FORM \nResponse, AX C \u00b6 10) \nApplicant did not address how the victim\u2019s state of intoxication affected his \nperception that she was genuinely attracted to him or, more importantly, her willingness \nto go with him to his apartment. (GX 6; FORM Response, AX C \u00b6 10) \nBased on all of the information gathered by the police, a warrant for Applicant\u2019s \narrest was sworn by the victim. On May 8, 2016, Applicant was taken into custody and \ncharged with felony abduction with intent to defile. Conviction for that offense in the state \nwhere he was charged carries with it a sentence of at least 20 years in prison. On August \n25, 2016, Applicant entered an Alford plea in response to a reduced charge of \nmisdemeanor sexual battery. He was adjudged guilty and sentenced to 12 months in jail, \nwith four months of that sentence suspended for two years. He also was placed on \nsupervised probation for two years (expected completion on August 25, 2018) with five \nconditions attached: be of good behavior; complete a sex offender evaluation and any \ntreatment recommended therefrom; complete 250 hours of community service by \nSeptember 2017; have no contact with the victim; and waive his right to appeal. (FORM, \nItems 2, 4, and 7) \n \nApplicant completed his community service as required on June 28, 2017; \nhowever, his sex offender evaluation resulted in a recommendation that he \u201cparticipate in \npsychoeducational services for people who have engaged in inappropriate sexual \nbehavior.\u201d On May 18, 2017, Applicant and his probation officer reviewed that \nrecommendation; however, Applicant told his probation officer that he would not \nparticipate in those services because the named provider could not provide a definitive \nschedule for completion of the psychoeducational services. He further indicated he \nwanted to get his own service provider for that part of his probation. On May 19, 2017, \nthe probation officer reported this information to the judge who had sentenced Applicant. \n(FORM, Item 7) \nAs alleged at SOR 2.a, Applicant was charged with violating the terms of his \nprobation and ordered to show cause why the court should not impose the suspended \nportion of his original jail sentence. On July 25, 2017, he appeared in general district court \nand pleaded not guilty; however, he was found guilty at a bench trial and sentenced to \n120 days in jail. Applicant immediately appealed his conviction to the circuit court, where \nhe would have the opportunity for a jury trial. On August 3, 2018, after his trial date had \nbeen continued four times, the charges were dismissed. Applicant claims that he never \nrefused to comply with the terms of his probation. Instead, he claimed to be concerned \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout timely completion of the recommended psychosexual education services and still \nbe able to complete his community service obligations. Applicant claims he told his \nprobation officer that he was trying to find a suitable service provider other than the one \ndesignated by the probation office, and that he subsequently completed the class. The \nprobation officer\u2019s letter to the court stated that Applicant was not cooperating with the \nprobation officer as required. Neither party submitted any information that shows \nApplicant completed the classes recommended in the sexual offender evaluation or when \nthat may have occurred. (FORM, Items 4 and 7; FORM Response, AX C \u00b6\u00b6 17 \u2013 19) \nIn response to the information presented in support of SOR 1.a and 2.b, Applicant \nnow denies engaging in the criminal conduct or sexual behavior alleged. He claims he \nmet the victim outside the bar as he was waiting for a ride to meet friends somewhere \nelse. After a brief conversation, he claims they decided to walk to his nearby apartment \nwhere things became amorous. Applicant avers he and the victim first sat on the couch \nin his living room to make out, then moved without complaint by the victim to his bedroom. \n(In his statement to the police, Applicant stated that she went into the bedroom first and \nhe brought her out to the couch.) Applicant further has responded that, as things became \nmore sexual on the bed, the victim suddenly \u201cbegan screaming and flailing about . . .[and \nthat] she was in a wild rage.\u201d He claims he then helped her find her way out, but that he \nalso was concerned for her well-being and was on his way downstairs to look for her when \nhe encountered the victim and the police. (FORM Response, AX C \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 10.) \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his January 2018 e-QIP, he disclosed his May 2016 \narrest and subsequent conviction, indicating that he entered an Alford plea in response \nto the charge of misdemeanor sexual battery. In response to the FORM, Applicant argues, \nin part because an Alford plea does not specifically acknowledge guilt, that he did not \ncommit the crime for which he was convicted. He further argues that his entry of an Alford \nplea was made solely to avoid the expense and risk of a trial on the original felony charge, \nwhich he felt he could not win because of racial and social biases he presumed would \nimpede his access to a fair trial. An Alford plea is one in which a defendant pleads guilty \nand accepts the punishment of the court while still claiming to be innocent of the charges \nagainst him or her. Defendant entering an Alford plea acknowledges, and the court must \nalso conclude, that the evidence supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970). See also ISCR Case 07-03307 at 8, \nn. 7 (App. Bd., Sept. 26, 2008; reversed administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s \nAlford plea plus his denials supported a finding that Applicant did not sexually assault his \ndaughter. See also, ISCR Case 15-07009 at 2, n. 2 (App. Bd., July 25, 2017). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs noted at the outset, Applicant is an accomplished computer engineer and an \nexcellent employee. He is active in the IT sector as a mentor and is involved in several \nprofessional mutual-support endeavors. In support of his case, he submitted five letters \nof support and recommendation, one of which was from Applicant\u2019s supervisor for his \ncommunity service between 2016 and 2018. He observed Applicant to be trustworthy, \nreliable, and professional. The author has reviewed the SOR allegations and the FORM \nwith its supporting documents, but he has no firsthand knowledge of the events \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s arrest. Notwithstanding that information, the author recommends \nApplicant for a position of trust. (FORM Response, AX M) The other four letters were \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nauthored by his parents, brother, and sister. Each is also familiar with the Government\u2019s \ninformation in support of the SOR; however, none of them have any firsthand knowledge \nof the events at issue here. They each speak highly of Applicant\u2019s character and provide \nexamples of his integrity, hard work, and dedication to family. Knowing him as they do, \nthey are convinced of his innocence and are equally convinced that he was wrongly \narrested and prosecuted because of systemic racism and the fallout from the #MeToo \nMovement that might result in an unfair disadvantage for the accused in cases such as \nthis. (FORM Response, AX I \u2013 L) \nFor his part, Applicant laments the effects his arrest and prosecution have had on \nhis personal life, and he says he has learned some lessons from that experience: \nThe experience I have endured has been horrific. One evening I literally \nthought a pretty girl was interested in me, and her reciprocal actions made \nme think all was okay. Unfortunately, all did not turn out well and my life has \nbeen in tatters since. Of course, there are lessons to be learned. I \narticulated that one thing I should have done was immediately contacted \n(sic) a lawyer, but that pertains to actions after the fact. What I should not \nhave done was flirt or otherwise attempt to engage in a relationship with a \nfemale who was inebriated. This is where I take responsibility for my \nactions. This should not have happened, and now a painful lesson has been \nlearned. (FORM Response, AX C \u00b6 20) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nAnalysis \nSexual Behavior \nAvailable information shows that Applicant sexually assaulted an intoxicated \nwoman in May 2016. He knew she was intoxicated, which he believed would make her \nmore compliant to his sexual advances. When she did not comply and made clear that \nshe did not want to have sex with him, he used physical force to try to stop her from \nleaving his apartment. This information reasonably raises a security concern that is stated \nat AG \u00b6 12 as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAdditionally, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted) and 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature --\nOR that \nreflects lack of discretion or judgment) (Emphasis added). Applicant was prosecuted and \nfor his actions, and his conduct that evening reflected a significant failure of judgment and \ndiscretion. I also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 14 mitigating conditions: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAs to AG \u00b6 14(e), I infer from the fact that he is no longer on probation that Applicant \neventually completed all of the conditions thereof, including the psychoeducational \nservices ordered from his sexual offender evaluation. However, there is no information in \nthe record about the actual results of his evaluation or the content of the \npsychoeducational services that shows it meets any of the criteria addressed in AG \u00b6 \n14(e). \nAs to AG \u00b6 14(b), although the record reflects only this one incidence of sexual \nmisconduct that occurred four years ago, Applicant\u2019s behavior still reflects adversely on \nhis judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. At the time of this incident, Applicant stated \nhis belief the victim was \u201can easy target.\u201d Applicant\u2019s re-characterization of that statement, \nnamely that the victim looked like \u201can ideal partner,\u201d is most accurately viewed, given all \nof the information probative of this issue of fact, as disingenuous and self-serving. It further \nshows that Applicant has not yet taken full responsibility for his actions and that he lacks \nthe good character required of one entrusted with classified information. \nWhether such circumstances are unlikely to recur turns on whether Applicant has \ndemonstrated that his judgment is now properly attuned to the impropriety of his conduct \nin May 2016. After spending time in jail and on probation for inappropriate sexual behavior \nof a criminal nature, one would think that would be the case. Nonetheless, while Applicant \nappears to accept responsibility for his actions, he also tries to cast himself as a victim \nwho was wrongfully accused. His response to the Government\u2019s information indicates that \nhe does not recognize the severity of his actions and has not accepted responsibility for \nwhat happened. With all of the foregoing in mind, I cannot conclude that Applicant will not \nengage in similar conduct in the future. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. I further \nconclude that, on balance, Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns established by \nthe Government\u2019s information about his sexual behavior. \nCriminal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s information in support of SOR 2.b (and by reference SOR 1.a) \nestablished that Applicant\u2019s conduct in May 2016 met the elements of the crime of sexual \nassault in the state where that conduct occurred. Additionally, the information presented \nin support of SOR 2.a established that Applicant chose not to cooperate with his probation \nofficer regarding recommended psychoeducational services. This information reasonably \nraised a security concern about criminal conduct stated at AG \u00b6 30: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) (evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted) and 31(d) (violation or \nrevocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation \nprogram). \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply for the same reasons the AG \u00b6 14(b), \ndiscussed above, does not apply. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility \nfor the conduct documented herein is, at best, equivocal. As such, it undermines \nconfidence in his judgment. He laments the effects his arrest and prosecution have had \non him, and he regrets only that he \u201cattempted to engage in a relationship with a female \nwho was inebriated.\u201d Despite his Alford plea, at no point in this adjudication has Applicant \nacknowledged the substantial evidence that he committed a crime by physically \nrestraining a woman in an attempt to have non-consensual sex with her. In response to \nthe FORM, Applicant also expressed his belief that he could not receive a fair trial \nbecause of systemic racism (he is African-American and the victim is white) and because \nof the #MeToo Movement that was at its height at the time of his arrest. It cannot be \ndisputed that these factors have, for too long, degraded the fairness of our criminal justice \nsystem and society in general. Nonetheless, the facts established by this record, including \nApplicant\u2019s own admissions, show that Applicant committed the crimes addressed in the \nSOR. \nIn view of all of the available information, it is not likely that he was charged and \nconvicted for reasons of racial or gender bias. He was prosecuted because of the factual \nevidence. Here, the facts contained in the criminal complaint were gathered in the hours \nimmediately following the victim\u2019s escape from Applicant\u2019s apartment. Also, the victim \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthought Applicant was gay and did not go to his apartment to have sex; thus, this was \nhardly an instance of a white woman crying \u201crape\u201d against a black man because she felt \nsome bigoted embarrassment for her own actions. As a person of color, Applicant may \noften have good reason to be fearful that racial biases might be used against his person \nor property; however, that did not happen here. The factual record in this case is \nstraightforward, and it does not appear from the available information that Applicant was \ntreated harshly or unfairly. \nIn considering the applicability of AG \u00b6 32(c), I note that in response to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted, with explanation, SOR 2.a, arguing that the charge was dismissed. \nNonetheless, in the context of security clearance adjudications such as this, the ultimate \ncourt disposition is not dispositive. The fact remains that Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with \nall of the terms of his probation was sufficient for a charge of probation violation for which \nhe was initially convicted and sentenced to the serve the previously-suspended portion \nof his jail sentence. It was only after a year of trial continuances during which he eventually \ncompleted the terms of his sentence that the charge was dismissed, an event that does \nnot lessen the security significance of the original charge. AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply. \nThe applicability of AG \u00b6 32(c) to SOR 2.b is equally problematic. Applicant also \nadmitted this allegation in response to the SOR. In response to the FORM, however, he \ndenied that he committed the crime of sexual assault. In addition to his denial, he cited \nhis use of an Alford plea to avoid admission of guilt, claiming instead that he felt he did \nnot have the resources with which to contest the charge at trial and such a plea would \npreserve his claims of innocence. Balanced against this claim is the fact that the court \nwas required to conclude, which it did, that the state\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support \na finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Applicant was adjudged guilty and \nsentenced to a period of incarceration along with probation, clinical evaluation, and \ncommunity service. Department Counsel\u2019s evidence in support of SOR 2.b leaves little \ndoubt about Applicant\u2019s conduct, and it precludes application of AG \u00b6 32(c) to SOR 2.b. \nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under this \nguideline. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines D and J, I have reviewed the record before me in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Only the factor at AG \u00b6 2(d)(3) \n(frequency and recency of the conduct) benefits Applicant because the sexual assault \noccurred once more than four years ago. This may also be said of the probation violation \nin 2017. In addition, I note that Applicant is an accomplished IT professional whose \noutstanding on-the-job performance is reflected in his most recent performance \nevaluations. I have also considered that he is active in his community and in professional \nnetworking initiatives. It is also noteworthy that the organization for whom he worked as \npart of his court-ordered community service saw fit to recommend Applicant for a position \nof trust despite the adverse information in Applicant\u2019s background. Nonetheless, \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior and criminal conduct raised reasonable security concerns \nthat precluded a conclusion that Applicant should continue to have access to classified \ninformation. In response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant has not established \nthat his judgment and trustworthiness are no longer of concern despite all that has \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \ntranspired. As a result, I am left with significant doubts about his suitability for access to \nclassified information. Because the protection of the national interest is the principal goal \nof these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s SOR response admitted all of the SOR allegations. Applicant also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 42-year-old information technology specialist employed by the same defense contractor since February 2016.

Fischer, Esq. \n06/0/2020 \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nHarvey, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant made an effort to consolidate and start payments to address his \ndelinquent student loan debts from March 2020 to May 2020; however, he waited too long \nto take these actions. More of a track record of payments and more complete information \nabout his student loans is necessary to mitigate Guideline F (financial considerations) \ntrustworthiness concerns relating to his history of delinquent student loans. Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 25, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn November 13, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n\n2 \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \neligibility for a public trust position for Applicant. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth trustworthiness concerns arising under Guideline F. \nOn December 17, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a \nhearing. (HE 3) On February 19, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On \nFebruary 21, 2020, the case was assigned to me. On February 27, 2020, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for March 16, 2020. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.   \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered \nsix exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. \n(Tr. 16-21; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE F) On March 19, 2020, DOHA received \na copy of the transcript of the hearing. Applicant requested and received a delay until \nApril 17, 2020, to submit additional evidence. (Tr. 67) Applicant hired counsel after his \nhearing, and I extended the deadline to submit additional documentation to May 261, \n2020. (HE 4; HE 5) On May 21, 2020, Applicant provided 15 exhibits (AE G-AE U) and \na statement from Applicant (AE V). On May 26, 2020, Applicant\u2019s employer provided a \nletter describing his performance at work. (AE W) All documents were admitted without \nobjection. (AE G-AE W)  \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. \nSpecific information is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. ISCR and ADP \ndecisions and the Directive are available at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/isp.html.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted all of the SOR allegations. Applicant \nalso provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \naccepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old information technology specialist employed by the \nsame defense contractor since February 2016. (Tr. 6-7, 38; AE V at 1) He has \nnot been unemployed during the previous five years. (Tr. 8) He has never served in \nthe military. (Tr. 7) He has never married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 7)  \nIn 1995, Applicant graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) In 2000, he received \ntwo bachelor\u2019s degrees, one in music education and one in music performance. (Tr. 8, \n22-23; AE T; AE V at 4) In 2002, he received a master\u2019s degree in music. (Tr. 8, 27-28;\nAE T; AE V at 4) In 2011, he received a doctorate degree in musical arts (DMA). (Tr. 8;\nAE T; AE V at 4)\n\n3 \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges 23 student loan debts totaling $435,830 that were placed \nfor collection in the following amounts: 1.a ($70,373); 1.b ($62,616); 1.c ($58,320); 1.d \n($56,786); 1.e ($38,207); 1.f ($15,394); 1.g ($14,985); 1.h ($10,198); 1.i ($10,198); 1.j \n($8,808); 1.k ($7,198); 1.l ($5,482); 1.m ($5,165); 1.n ($4,580); 1.o ($4,356); 1.p ($4,057); \n1.q ($3,267); 1.r ($2,999); 1.t ($12,379); 1.u ($12,379); 1.v ($2,617); 1.w ($20,156); and\n1.x ($5,310). The creditor for the first 18 SOR debts is the Department of Education\n(DOE), and the creditor for the last five SOR debts is a bank. Applicant said he owed\nmore than $435,000 to his student loan creditors. (AE V at 1)\nSOR \u00b6 1.s alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $111. \nApplicant believes the telecommunications bill was erroneous. (AE F) Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent credit report of record was dated February 14, 2020, and it does not include the \ntelecommunications debt. (GE 4)  \nAfter receiving his DMA degree in 2011, Applicant had difficulty finding \nemployment in music that paid enough for him to address his student loans. (Tr. 33-34) \nHe did not maintain contact with his creditors because he could not afford payments. (Tr. \n34-35) Between 2011 and 2016, he may have submitted one or more requests for\nhardship deferments. (Tr. 40-41) He may have contacted some of his student loan\ncreditors around 2016. (Tr. 39) He had difficulty assessing and reconciling the various\npayment options. (Tr. 39-40) Around 2017, he entered a rehabilitation program for five of\nhis student loans. (Tr. 36; AE B) He claimed he did not realize his rehabilitation program\ndid not include all of his student loans. (Tr. 37) He said he was confused because he was\nworking with multiple websites and creditors. (Tr. 37) Some of his pay at some point was\nbeing garnished to pay his student loans. (Tr. 38)\nOn October 29, 2018, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant about his delinquent student loans. (GE 5) Applicant estimated his \nstudent loan debts totaled $442,000. (GE 5) Prior to October 2018, he had been paying \nhis creditors about $20 each month for nine months. (GE 5) He said he planned to \nconsolidate his loans and then arrange a payment plan. (GE 5)   \nIn his December 27, 2019 SOR response, Applicant said, \u201cThe [student] loans are \nin the process of consolidation and establish[ment] of repayment plan through Navient, \nthe recommended option at the time I completed repayment forms on the federal \ngovernment student loans website.\u201d (HE 3) He did not provide a copy of the \ndocumentation showing his application for consolidation or to establish a repayment plan. \nAt his hearing, Applicant provided a student loan account summary for five student \nloans being collected by ECMC showing payments for the period from October 12, 2017, \nto November 20, 2018. He said the five student loans were not included in the student \nloans listed on the SOR, and ECMC is not a creditor on his SOR. (Tr. 59) This summary \nwas printed on March 13, 2020. (AE B) When the five accounts were created on October \n12, 2017, the principal totaled $41,872 for the five student loans in the following amounts: \n$2,074; $4,208; $9,809; $9,809; and $15,972. (AE B at 5) He made $5 monthly payments \n\n4 \nfrom February to October 2018. (AE B) In February 2018, his employer made two $268 \npayments. \n(AE \nB \nat \n4) \nIn \nNovember \n2018, \nthe \n\u201cLender/School\u201d \nmade \n\u201cRehabilitation/Repurchase Payment[s] totaling $49,572 as follows: $18,909; $4,982; \n$2,455; $11,613; and $11,613. (AE B at 1) Applicant did not provide documentation \nshowing the current status of the five student loan debts. He did not know what happened \nto them. (Tr. 59) The summary does not show any payments after November 20, 2018. \n(AE B)  \nFrom January 21, 2018, to November 20, 2019, Applicant paid $536 per month to \naddress the student loans held by DOE\u2019s Default Resolution Group; however, the \npayments were not applied \u201cto guaranty agencies or to the Department prior to when the \ndebt entered default.\u201d (AE G; AE H; AE V at 1-2) From November 20, 2019, to March 11, \n2020, he paid $592 per month to DOE. (AE G; AE I; AE V at 1-2) All of his payments were \napplied to fees and interest, and none of his payments were applied to the principal owed. \n(AE G) The student loan payments were temporarily stopped in April 2020, due to the \nCorona virus. (AE J; AE V at 1-2)  \nOn March 9, 2020, and May 15, 2020, Applicant paid Navient $305. (AE C; AE M) \nHe said his first payment to Navient was on March 9, 2020. (Tr. 61) He said he believed \nthe $305 payment applied to the five ECMC loans totaling $49,572. (Tr. 60; AE B) He \nprovided an April 2020 statement indicating the $305 payment applied to two consolidated \nstudent loans totaling $52,810. (AE M) No payment was due in April 2020 due to the \nimpact of the Corona virus. (AE M)  \nApplicant said he was making \u201ctwo simultaneous payments with Navient and then \n[to] Immediate Credit Recovery\u201d (ICR). (Tr. 41) He was making $592 payments every \nmonth through garnishment of his salary. (Tr. 41-42; AE A)  His pay statement for March \n6, 2020, showed that his employer paid $1,479 out of his salary to address his student \nloans in the year to date. (AE A) He was unsure about how long the garnishment was in \neffect. (Tr. 57) He believed that after five more payments to ICR, he would complete the \nICR program and rehabilitate his loans. (Tr. 42) Applicant did not provide documentation \nshowing which student loans were included in the Navient or the ICR programs that were \nbeing paid through a garnishment. \nApplicant said he always wanted to pay his student loans; however, he lacked \nsufficient income to do so. (Tr. 42) Applicant sets aside about $300 monthly for his parents \nin case they have an emergency. (Tr. 45-46) He also has some medical bills totaling about \n$1,500. (Tr. 46, 52-53) He has a savings account with more than $10,000 but less than \n$100,000 on deposit. (Tr. 48-49) He clarified that he might have between $40,000 and \n$50,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 48-49)  \nOn March 13, 2020, Applicant signed a Federal Loan Rehabilitation form which \nincludes a budget to enable a student loan creditor to set a payment level that he could \nafford. (AE E) The loan rehabilitation program involves making nine9 payments over 10 \nmonths, and the monthly payment amount is as low as $5. (AE E at 1; See Department \nof Education, Federal Student Aid Website Links: Home; Manage Loans; Delinquency \nand Default; Getting Out of Default, located at https://studentaid.gov/manage-\n\n5 \nloans/default/get-out (HE 7) Applicant\u2019s March 13, 2020 Loan Rehabilitation form \nindicated his current monthly income is $5,221. (AE E at 1) His monthly expenses total \n$4,013, and his four largest monthly expenses are food ($1,800), student loans ($896), \nhousing ($550), and utilities ($400). (AE E at 1) There is no item on the form for amounts \nwithheld for Social Security, Medicare, and federal and state taxes, which total $1,278, in \nhis pay statement. (AE A (pay statement))  \nAfter his hearing, Applicant submitted his March 30, 2020 Loan Rehabilitation form, \nwhich indicated his current monthly income is $3,085. (AE K) He said his monthly \nexpenses total $2,537, and his four largest monthly expenses are food ($500), private \nstudent loans ($305), housing ($550), and utilities ($600). (AE K) According to Applicant\u2019s \npay statement for March 15, 2020 to March 28, 2020, his gross pay for two weeks was \n$2,611 or $5,222 per month. (AE J). He did not explain the income discrepancy between \nthe March 13 and March 30, 2020 Loan Rehabilitation forms; however, I conclude that \nthe March 30, 2020 the student loan form reflects correctly reflects net pay information \nand not gross pay information.  \nApplicant\u2019s Loan Rehabilitation form states, \u201cIf I rehabilitate a loan and default on \nthe same loan again in the future, I may not rehabilitate that loan a second time.\u201d (AE K, \nat 1 \u00b6 12; AE K at 3 \u00a7 4 \u00b6 6) Other than the five ECMC loans totaling $49,572 discussed \npreviously, he did not specify any particular student loans that were previously \nrehabilitated. \nApplicant is in the process of applying for an income-driven student loan payment \nprogram. A brief explanation of that program follows: \nUnder a loan rehabilitation agreement, your loan holder will determine a \nreasonable monthly payment amount that is equal to 15 percent of your \nannual discretionary income, divided by 12. Discretionary income is the \namount of your adjusted gross income (from your most recent federal \nincome tax return) that exceeds 150 percent of the poverty guideline \namount for your state and family size. You must provide documentation of \nyour income to your loan holder. (HE 7) \nIt is possible to obtain a lower monthly payment than that described in the quoted formula, \nwhich is known as an alternative monthly payment. (HE 7) The alternative monthly \npayment is based on submitting a budget and not on the information on a tax return. (AE \nE; HE 7)  \nOn March 25, 2020, Applicant signed a loan rehabilitation agreement which \nspecified \u201cI understand that I must make at least 9 monthly payments of $128.00 \nbeginning March 25, 2020, with each payment due on the 25th of each month thereafter.\u201d \n(AE K) In March 2020, an Education Department representative informed Applicant \u201cthat \nall collection activity has been suspended for at least 60 days and [he was] not required \nto make payments due to the pandemic.\u201d (AE V at 2) His first $128 payment was made \non May 11, 2020. (AE L; AE V at 2) He believed that after he completes the loan \n\n6 \nrehabilitation period, he will be able to consolidate his federal student loans through \nNavient and make the required monthly payments of about $337. (AE V at 2)  \nApplicant attended credit counseling in May 2020. (AE N; AE O; AE V at 2-3) He \ncompleted a budget. (AE O) He also completed training courses in several areas including \ninformation technology, cyber security, and protection of personal and medical privacy. \n(AE S) \nApplicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for the last four years. (AE P; \nAE V at 2) His adjusted gross income on his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax \ntranscripts for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018 was as follows: 2016-$51,576; 2017-\n$54,667; and 2018-$56,428. (AE P) For each of those three years, he received a \nsubstantial tax refund when he filed his tax returns. (AE P)  \nApplicant promised to maintain his financial responsibility in the future. He said: \nI will always pay my debts to maintain financial stability. I will never put myself \nin a financial situation where my Security Clearance will be in question or be \nplaced at risk, and if I fail to adhere to this statement, I consent to automatic \nrevocation of my Security Clearance. (AE Q; AE V at 3) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant received an excellent employee performance evaluation for 2019 \nindicating he is a \u201cHighly Valued\u201d employee. (AE D; AE W) He is intelligent and \nprofessional. (AE D) He has made important contributions to his employer. (AE D; AE R) \nCharacter references described him as extremely dedicated, very reliable, totally focused, \nalways trustworthy, always prompt, well prepared, diligent, responsible, dependable, \nversatile, intelligent, insightful, highly productive, articulate, and professional. (AE U) He \nvolunteered to help others in his community. (Id.) Applicant\u2019s employer lauded his \ndiligence and professionalism and emphasized his performance evaluations and \npromotion from System Engineer to Senior System Engineer on October 27, 2019. (AE \nW)   \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [public trust position].\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access to classified information \napplies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified information. As Commander in \nChief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity or other sensitive information and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See Id. at 527.  \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \n\n7 \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in \nthe Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her [access to sensitive information].\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or trustworthiness] determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d \n\n8 \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation \nomitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise [sensitive] information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust position].  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history \nof not paying his student loan debts when due establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c).  \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n9 \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue.\nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s [eligibility for a public trust \nposition], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \n[eligibility for a public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in [public trust position] \ndecisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. He disputed his \nresponsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.s, and that debt did not appear on his most recent \ncredit report. He is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.s.  \nIn the last 30 months, Applicant made some progress addressing his student loan \ndebt. From October 12, 2017, to November 20, 2018, he made nine $5 payments in a \nloan rehabilitation program to address five ECMC student loans, which totaled $49,572 \nin November 2018. Those five ECMC loans may have been consolidated into two Navient \nloans, which totaled $52,810 in April 2020. He made two $305 payments to Navient in \n2020. These two Navient consolidated debts may not have been included in the SOR.  \nThe DOE garnished Applicant\u2019s pay from October 2017 to present, and the \ngarnishment amounts ranged from $536 to $592 per month. Applicant did not indicate \nwhich student loans were being addressed by the garnishment. In May 2020, Applicant \nmade a $128 payment into a federal student loan rehabilitation program. Applicant did \nnot indicate which student loans were being addressed by this student loan rehabilitation \nprogram. It is unclear whether Applicant previously participated in a federal loan \nrehabilitation program for some of his federal student loans, and if he did participate in \n\n10 \nsuch a program, those loans would not be included in the current federal loan \nrehabilitation program. \nApplicant indicated his finances were harmed through underemployment and low \nincome; however, he did not establish that he was unable to make greater progress \naddressing his student loans after he became employed in 2016 by his current employer. \n\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant \nhas since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, \n2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A component is whether \nhe or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments \nto keep debts current. Applicant did not establish that he maintained contact with his \ncreditors over the years. Applicant does not receive full mitigating credit under AG 20(b) \nbecause he did not provide enough information about his finances to establish that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant received ample warning through his OPM interview in 2018 and the SOR \nin 2019 of the trustworthiness issue pertaining to the delinquent student loans and his \nfinances. His October 29, 2018 OPM summary of interview indicated he planned to \nconsolidate his loans and then arrange a payment plan. In response to the SOR, he \narticulated the same plan. As of the date of his hearing, he had not consolidated his \nstudent loans or made sufficient progress addressing them. After his hearing, he signed \na loan rehabilitation agreement, and he made a single $128 payment. He did not provide \nany information about which student loans were in the loan rehabilitation program. As of \nMay 21, 2020, his student loans are not consolidated and in a single payment plan.    \nThe timing of the resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts is a pertinent consideration. The \nAppeal Board has observed, \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having \nbeen placed on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness designations are in \njeopardy may be disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). \nMost of Applicant\u2019s payments to address his student loans were through a wage \ngarnishment. Payment of a debt \u201cthough garnishment rather than a voluntary effort \ndiminishes its mitigating force.\u201d Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. \n26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of \ntwo of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations \nconcerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished \npayments towards delinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light of other \nfactors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to \nthe administrative judge and stating when addressing an IRS garnishment, \u201cOn its face, \nsatisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor\u2019s garnishment is \nnot the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d). \n\n11 \n\u201c[I]t is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about \nthe resolution of specific debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02912 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016)). \u201cThis implies something \nthat independently substantiates the resolution of debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03462 at 5 \nn.7 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2018) (noting absence of IRS tax transcripts and citing ISCR Case\nNo. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016)). Failure to provide requested financial\ninformation \u201cwithout explaining why it was that such a document was not available\u201d may\nundermine a determination that Applicant met his burden of persuasion. See ISCR Case\nNo. 16-02322 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018) (reversing grant of security clearance in part\ndue to failure of Applicant to provide an IRS tax transcript). Applicant has a responsibility\nto provide reasonably available requested financial information, and failure to provide that\ninformation reduces mitigation.\nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence about the status of Applicant\u2019s student loans. \nHe did not present clear evidence of the number and amounts of his student loans. He \ndid not establish which student loans were in the current loan rehabilitation program. A \nsingle $128 payment into a loan rehabilitation program, two $305 payments to Navient, \nand garnishment of his pay for unspecified student loans does not establish a track record \nof voluntary loan payments to address the student loans listed on his SOR. Applicant did \nnot prove he was unable to make greater progress sooner resolving his student loan \ndebts. He did not adequately explain why he did not apply some of the money from his \nsavings account to bring his student loans to current status. There are not clear \nindications his financial problems are under control. Applicant failed to establish mitigation \nof financial considerations concerns.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant access to a \npublic trust position and access to sensitive information \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n\n12 \nApplicant is a 42-year-old information technology specialist employed by a defense \ncontractor since February 2016. In 2000, he received two bachelor\u2019s degrees, one in \nmusic education and one in music performance. In 2002, he received a master\u2019s degree \nin music. In 2011, he received a DMA. Applicant received an excellent employee \nperformance evaluation for 2019 indicating he is a \u201cHighly Valued\u201d employee. He is \nintelligent and professional. He has made important contributions to his employer. \nCharacter references described him as extremely dedicated, very reliable, totally focused, \nalways trustworthy, always prompt, well prepared, diligent, responsible, dependable, \nversatile, intelligent, insightful, highly productive, articulate, and professional. He \nvolunteered to help others in his community. Applicant\u2019s employer lauded his diligence \nand professionalism and emphasized his performance evaluations and promotion from \nSystem Engineer to Senior System Engineer on October 27, 2019.     \nApplicant did not make sufficient progress resolving his student loan debts. He \ncurrently owes more than $435,000 to his student loan creditors, and he did not establish \nthat he made any payments to address some of those debts for several years after he \nreceived his DMA degree in 2011. He did not prove he maintained contact with his \ncreditors. He did not provide a comprehensive and detailed list of the amounts of his \nstudent loans and the current status of each student loan. He did not establish he was \nunable to make greater progress sooner bringing his student loans to current status. He \nfailed to establish a track record of sufficient duration of student loan payments. His \nactions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate \nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concerns. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n18. More documented financial progress must be made before he has mitigated\ntrustworthiness concerns.\nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of access \nto sensitive information. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a public trust position to \nApplicant is not warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a public trust position in the future. With more effort towards documented \nresolution of his student loans, and a track record of behavior consistent with his \nobligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his worthiness \nfor a public trust position.  \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). \n\n13 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:     \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.t through 1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n____________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old engineer employed by defense contractors since January 2009. (AX A.) He has never married and has no children. He worked for a federal contractor as a computer programmer from September 2005 to February 2006 and for non-government employers from March 2006 to December 2008. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in September 2006. His SCA reflects that he received a security clearance in July 2006 and is seeking to continue that clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 5, 2016. On \nDecember 11, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF), sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines G and J. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 16, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nwritten case on April 10, 2020. On April 14, 2020, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on April 21, 2020, and responded with a two-page statement \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A), a two-page press release about his current employer (AX B), \nand a one-page statement from his lawyer reflecting his intention to appeal the conviction \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (AX C). All three exhibits were admitted without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on June 11, 2020.  \n \n \nThe FORM included a summary of an interview by a security investigator on \nNovember 9, 2017. Applicant objected to the interview summary, which was not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. I have sustained his objection and have \nnot considered the interview summary in my decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 2.a, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old engineer employed by defense contractors since \nJanuary 2009. (AX A.) He has never married and has no children. He worked for a federal \ncontractor as a computer programmer from September 2005 to February 2006 and for \nnon-government employers from March 2006 to December 2008. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in September 2006. His SCA reflects that he \nreceived a security clearance in July 2006 and is seeking to continue that clearance. \n(FORM Item 2 at 35.) \n \n \nOn January 1, 2008, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI). \nHe was convicted on April 3, 2008, fined $1,488, placed on probation for 18 months, and \nsentenced to jail for 10 days, with 9 days suspended. He was required to undergo an \nalcohol evaluation and counseling, attend a victim-impact panel, and install a vehicle \nignition interlock. (FORM Item 2 at 29-30.) On December 30, 2010, he submitted an \napplication to set aside the judgment and order on the ground that he had fulfilled the \nconditions of the probation. His application was granted on January 5, 2011, and his \nconviction was set aside. (GX 2 at 29; Answer at 7-8.) \n \n \nOn September 3, 2017, while Applicant\u2019s application to continue his security \nclearance was pending decision, he was arrested for speeding and DUI. (FORM Item 5.) \nWhen asked by a police officer whether he had been drinking, he declined to answer. He \ndeclined a request to undergo a field-sobriety test or provide a breath sample. He \nrequested an opportunity to talk to a lawyer. The police officer allowed him to call a lawyer \nand observed him talking to someone. The police officer declined to allow him to attempt \nto contact another lawyer. The police officer obtained a search warrant from a magistrate, \nobtained a blood sample, and allowed Applicant to go home in a ride-share vehicle. The \nlaboratory analysis of Applicant\u2019s blood sample reflected a blood-alcohol content (BAC) \nof .183. (FORM Item 5.)  \n\n \n3 \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s trial in June 12-13, 2019, he requested that he be given the \nchromatograms for his blood samples. The trial judge deferred ruling until the state\u2019s \nexpert from the laboratory testified. It is not clear from the record whether Applicant \nrenewed his request after the state\u2019s expert testified. The jury acquitted him of DUI but \nconvicted him having a BAC of more than .08 and \u201cExtreme DUI,\u201d with a BAC of more \nthan .15. In July 2019, he was fined $2,779; sentenced to jail for 180 days, with 171 days \nsuspended; and placed on probation for 36 months, with 12 months on supervised \nprobation and 24 months on unsupervised probation. The terms of his probation include \nalcohol screening and evaluation, treatment, attending a victim-impact program, violating \nno laws, and possessing or consuming no alcohol. (SOR Answer at 9.) The sentence and \nprobation were stayed pending his appeal. \n \nIn October 2019, Applicant appealed his conviction, alleging that he was illegally \ndetained following the initial traffic stop, that the arresting officer lacked probable cause \nto arrest him, that the arresting officer violated his right to counsel, and that the trial court \nerred by denying his request for disclosure of the chromatograms from his blood test. \n(SOR Answer at 10.) On April 9, 2020, the state superior court upheld Applicant\u2019s \nconviction. (FORM Item 6.)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he admitted his September 2017 DUI. He \nincluded a letter from his attorney dated April 29, 2020, stating that he was appealing to \nthe state court of appeals and raising the constitutional violations that were raised before \nthe state superior court. His appeal does not contradict his admission that he was \nintoxicated, but focuses on constitutional issues. (AX C.) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he moderated his alcohol \nconsumption after his DUI conviction in 2008, either limiting his consumption to two \nalcoholic beverages at a sitting or parking his vehicle and taking a cab home after \ndrinking.  He submitted no evidence reflecting how often he exceeded his two-drink limit \nand by how much. He stated that he had not consumed any alcohol at entertainment \nestablishments since his arrest, and that he now spends considerable time biking and \nhiking. (SOR Answer at 1-2.) In his response to the FORM, he stated that he now focuses \non off-duty activities that do not involve drinking and has not visited a drinking \nestablishment since his arrest. (AX A at 2.) He submitted no evidence in his SOR answer \nor his response to the FORM reflecting his drinking habits at home. \n  \n \nApplicant was required to undergo counseling after his DUI conviction in 2008. \nThere is no evidence in the FORM that he was diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder \nor that he was advised by a medical professional to abstain from alcohol or moderate his \nconsumption. The conditions of his probation after his second conviction included alcohol \nscreening, evaluation, treatment, attending a victim-impact panel, and abstinence from \nalcohol, but these requirements were stayed pending his appeal. He submitted no \nevidence of treatment or counseling after his conviction in June 2019. His answer to the \nSOR and response to the FORM indicate his intention to moderate his alcohol \nconsumption but not to abstain. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn April 2019, Applicant was nominated for a $500 bonus in recognition of his \ncontributions to the company, \u201cgoing above and beyond the expectations for [his] job \nposition. His team lead commented that he \u201cconsistently over-delivered more quickly than \nexpected and provided extraordinary value to the team.\u201d (SOR Answer at 4.) A co-worker \nfor the past 10 years has never him \u201creason to doubt his integrity or trustworthiness. The \nco-worker respects him for his consistent work ethic and technical excellence. (SOR \nAnswer at 5.) Applicant\u2019s chief engineer and immediate supervisor states: \u201cHis work is \nimpeccable attention to detail second to none. . . . Never once during our tenure as \ncolleagues has [Applicant] demonstrated anything less than professional character and \nattitude in the workplace.\u201d (SOR Answer at 6.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n\n \n5 \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction of DUI in January 2008, and \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s arrest for DUI in September 2017 and his subsequent \nconviction in June 2019. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d The following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish AG \n\u00b6 22(a). His BAC level after his DUI arrest in September 2017 establishes AG \u00b6 22(c). \nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines \u201cbinge drinking\u201d as \u201ca \npattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 \npercent or above,\u201d which typically occurs when a man has five or more drinks or a woman \nhas four or more drinks within a two-hour period. Centers for Disease Control and \n\n \n6 \n \nPrevention, Fact Sheets \u2013 Binge Drinking, www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-\ndrinking.htm.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n \nAG \u00b6 23(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress in a treatment program; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. The first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has \npassed\u201d) focuses on whether the conduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for \ndetermining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 2017 DUI was more than two years ago. His two DUI \narrests were more than nine years apart. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he \nmoderated his alcohol consumption after his DUI conviction in 2008, either limiting his \nconsumption to two alcoholic beverages at a sitting or parking his vehicle and taking a \ncab home after drinking. He submitted no evidence reflecting how often he exceeded his \ntwo-drink limit and by how much. He submitted no evidence reflecting his drinking habits \nat home. The evidence is insufficient to establish reform or rehabilitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive \nalcohol use, but he provided no evidence of counseling or treatment after his second DUI \nconviction. His answer to the SOR indicates that he intends to moderate his alcohol \nconsumption but not to abstain. It is too soon to determine whether he will adhere to his \n\n \n7 \n \ngoal of moderate consumption after the combined pressures of litigating his conviction \nand qualifying for continuance of his security clearance are lifted. He has not \ndemonstrated a \u201cclear and established pattern of modified consumption.\u201d  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and 23(d) are not applicable, because there is no evidence that \nApplicant sought or received counseling or treatment after his most recent DUI conviction. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under this \nguideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d  \n \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s two DUI convictions and his ongoing probation \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:   \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d) is not established. The \nprobation imposed after Applicant\u2019s second DUI conviction was stayed pending his \nappeal, which is still pending.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant has expressed remorse, and \nhe is well respected at his place of employment. However, he is facing the punishments \n\n \n8 \n \nimposed by the trial court if his appeal is unsuccessful, and insufficient time has passed \nto determine that his maladaptive alcohol use is unlikely to recur once he is relieved of \nthe pressure of litigating his conviction, complying with the terms of his probation if his \nappeal is unsuccessful, and qualifying to continue his security clearance. \n \nApplicant\u2019s appeal seeks to exclude evidence on constitutional grounds. DOHA \nproceedings are administrative and civil in nature, and they are not conducted with a strict \napplication of evidentiary rules required in criminal cases. The federal exclusionary rule \nfor illegally obtained evidence is not applicable to DOHA administrative proceedings. \nISCR Case No. 11-05079 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012), citing ISCR Case No. 02-012199 at n. \n7 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005; see also ISCR Case No. 95-0792 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 1996). \nApplicant has admitted that he was found guilty of the two DUIs, and his assertion of \nunconstitutional behavior by the police and state authorities has limited relevance to his \nsuitability for a security clearance. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nacknowledgement of his maladaptive alcohol consumption, his 11 years of service in \nsupport of national defense, and his reputation for integrity, trustworthiness, and attention \nto detail. Because he requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no \nopportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \n \n \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there \nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd.

After weighing the \n\n \n9 \n \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and J, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a questionnaire for national security positions (SF-86) on April \n2, 2019. Applicant is requesting a trustworthiness determination for access to sensitive \ninformation, also known as a \u201cpublic trust\u201d determination, to occupy an automated data \nprocessing (ADP) position. On January 3, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 29, 2020 (Ans.), and requested a \ndecision based on the written record without a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief \nwith supporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), was submitted \n\n \n2 \n \nby Department Counsel on April 6, 2020. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nrebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on May 5, 2020, \nbut did not submit a reply. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2020. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old executive administrative assistant for a defense \ncontractor, employed since April 2019. He was unemployed from November 2018 until \nApril 2019, and previously unemployed from December 2016 to August 2017 and July \n2014 to January 2016. He was married from 1985 and separated in January 1987. \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army for 10 months from 1981 to 1982, and \nin the Army National Guard from September 1985 to December 1991.  \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to file his 2014 state income tax return and owes \nthe state approximately $800 for unpaid taxes, and has six other collections accounts \ntotaling approximately $32,298. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and responded, \n\u201c[o]nce I return to work, I will consolidate all my bills.\u201d (Ans.)  \n \nIn reference to his delinquent tax debt, Applicant stated in his interview with a \ngovernment investigator, that he made payment arrangements while he was employed to \nsatisfy the state tax debt, but when he was laid off, he was unable to meet his obligations. \nHe also said that state garnished his bank account, so whenever funds are available, they \ndeduct a portion to be applied toward his debt.

There \nis no evidence of his current income, savings, overall financial status, or any financial \ncounseling received. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. The standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. DOD contractor personnel are \n\n \n3 \n \nentitled to the procedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1. \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant noted his inability to pay his delinquent debts was because of his periods \nof unemployment, including his most recent job loss in 2018. However, despite his intent \nto address his debts once he was re-employed, he has not shown any efforts or progress \ntoward resolving any of his debts. Despite his claim to have involuntarily paid toward his \nstate tax debt, he has not shown documentary evidence of such payments, nor is there \nevidence that his 2014 state tax return was filed. \n \nPromises or plans for future debt resolution are insufficient to apply mitigation \ncredit for responsible actions or good-faith efforts. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and there is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being \nresolved and will not recur in the future. Overall, Applicant has shown insufficient efforts \nto resolve debts, despite employment since April 2019.  No mitigating condition applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nThe administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F, in my whole-person analysis.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n         Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:    \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 44, was hired by a federal contracting company in May 2018. It is unclear from the record if Applicant started the assembler positon for which he was hired. He completed the security clearance application, his first, in May 2018. In response to questions about financial delinquencies, Applicant disclosed a student loan account. This delinquent account for $21,708 is the only allegation in the SOR. (GE 1-3) Applicant attended community college between June 2004 and July 2005, earning an associate\u2019s degree in an unspecified area of study. He financed his tuition with at least two student loans. Applicant claims that one of the student loans became delinquent during a period of unemployment from September 2008 to January 2009. Applicant blames his ongoing inability to rehabilitate or repay the delinquent loan on three periods of unemployment between September 2008 and May 2018, totaling 22 months. He also cites chronic underemployment at a series of day labor and temporary jobs. (GE 3-4) Applicant did not provide any updated financial information in response to the FORM. The only available financial information in the record, a July 2018 credit report, shows that Applicant has an overwhelmingly favorable credit history.

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/29/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns related \nto his delinquent student loan account. Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 22, 2019, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well \nas DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017.  DOD adjudicators \nwere unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR, admitted the allegation, and requested a decision \nwithout a hearing. (Government Exhibit (GE) 2.) The Government submitted its written \n\n \n2 \n \ncase on February 28, 2020. The Government provided Applicant a complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) and the Directive. He acknowledged receipt of the \ndocuments on May 14, 2020. He did not respond, waiving any potential objections to \nthe documents offered by the Government. The attachments to the FORM are admitted \nto the record as  Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. The case was assigned to \nme on July 21, 2020, and Department Counsel confirmed that DOHA retained \njurisdiction in this matter on July 23, 2020.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 44, was hired by a federal contracting company in May 2018. It is \nunclear from the record if Applicant started the assembler positon for which he was \nhired. He completed the security clearance application, his first, in May 2018. In \nresponse to questions about financial delinquencies, Applicant disclosed a student loan \naccount. This delinquent account for $21,708 is the only allegation in the SOR. (GE 1-3) \n \nApplicant attended community college between June 2004 and July 2005, \nearning an associate\u2019s degree in an unspecified area of study. He financed his tuition \nwith at least two student loans. Applicant claims that one of the student loans became \ndelinquent during a period of unemployment from September 2008 to January 2009. \nApplicant blames his ongoing inability to rehabilitate or repay the delinquent loan on \nthree periods of unemployment between September 2008 and May 2018, totaling 22 \nmonths. He also cites chronic underemployment at a series of day labor and temporary \njobs. (GE 3-4) \n \nApplicant did not provide any updated financial information in response to the \nFORM. The only available financial information in the record, a July 2018 credit report, \nshows that Applicant has an overwhelmingly favorable credit history. Of the 12 accounts \nreported, 11 (including the other student loan account) have a history of being paid as \nagreed and are in good standing. The credit report also shows that the creditor holding \nthe student loan account at issue has written off the debt. Applicant has not provided \nany updated information about the status of the account or his attempts, if any, to \nrehabilitate it. (GE 5) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits that he owes over $21,000 on a \ndelinquent student loan account. Applicant\u2019s admission and the credit report in the \nrecord support the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a history of not \nmeeting his financial obligations and an inability to repay his creditor. Financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions 19(a) and (c) apply. Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe financial concerns raised by his delinquent accounts. While Applicant\u2019s inability to \nrepay his delinquent student loan account may have been caused by events beyond his \ncontrol, he did not submit any information to demonstrate that he acted responsibility to \nresolve the delinquent account. He has not established a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditor, nor has he established that his finances are otherwise under control. \nAccordingly, none of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of production and \npersuasion to refute or mitigate the financial considerations concerns raised in the SOR.  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file Federal (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and state (SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2016, and 2017, and that, as of January 3, 2020, he owed $67,869 in Federal student-loan debts in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.o). When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he answered \u201cI admit\u201d to having failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for the years alleged. He asserted that his W-2 form arrived too late to timely file his income tax returns for 2013; that when he received the form, he informed a \u201ctax agent,\u201d who told him to file the next tax year. He cited financial hardships that apparently led to his failure to timely file tax returns for 2016 and 2017. Applicant provided documentation of Federal and state income tax payments to show that he had resolved his tax liabilities. Applicant also admitted that he had defaulted on the Federal student loans. He explained that he could not keep up with the payments, which resulted in penalties and then a delinquency status where he was no longer allowed to make payments. He provided documentation of a loan-rehabilitation program, and indicated that, because he is in graduate school, he is not currently required to make payments.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n05/28/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n___________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his late income tax filings for \ntax years 2013, 2016, and 2017. His defaulted Federal student loans have been \nrehabilitated and are currently in deferment. Clearance eligibility is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn January 3, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nOn January 31, 2020, Applicant responded to the Guideline F allegations and \nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On March 5, 2020, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including five enclosures consisting of its \ndocumentary evidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a \ncopy of the FORM to Applicant on March 6, 2020, and instructed him that any response \nwas due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on March 16, 2020, and \nhe submitted a timely response to the FORM that was received by DOHA on April 15, \n2020. On April 21, 2020, the Government indicated it had no objection to his response.  \n \nOn May 5, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. I received the case file on May 8, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as enclosure 3, a summary report of a triggered \nenhanced subject interview (TESI or personal subject interview (PSI)) of Applicant \nconducted on February 20, 2019. The summary report was included in the DOD Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal \nbackground ROI may be received in evidence and considered with an authenticating \nwitness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The \nsummary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows: \n  \nAlso, please note that the attached [summary] of your Triggered Enhanced \nSubject Interview (TESI) \u2013 labeled as Enclosure 3 \u2013 is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to the File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can comment on \nwhether [the] PSI summary accurately reflects the information you provided \nto the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear and \naccurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that the report is \nunauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections are raised in your \nresponse to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider it as evidence in your \ncase. \n\n3 \n \nApplicant did mention the PSI when he responded to the FORM. Concerning \nwhether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of \nwaiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights or protections \nbeyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 \nE3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he \nis responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or \nproven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide \nfor a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of \nhis opportunity to object to the admissibility of the PSI, to comment on the PSI, and to make \nany corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the PSI. Applicant is deemed to \nhave waived any objections to the PSI. Accordingly, FORM enclosures 1 through 5 were \naccepted into the record as Government exhibits (GEs). Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM \nwas admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file Federal (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) and state (SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2016, and 2017, and \nthat, as of January 3, 2020, he owed $67,869 in Federal student-loan debts in collection \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.o). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he answered \u201cI admit\u201d to having \nfailed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for the years alleged. He asserted \nthat his W-2 form arrived too late to timely file his income tax returns for 2013; that when he \nreceived the form, he informed a \u201ctax agent,\u201d who told him to file the next tax year. He cited \nfinancial hardships that apparently led to his failure to timely file tax returns for 2016 and \n2017. Applicant provided documentation of Federal and state income tax payments to show \nthat he had resolved his tax liabilities. Applicant also admitted that he had defaulted on the \nFederal student loans. He explained that he could not keep up with the payments, which \nresulted in penalties and then a delinquency status where he was no longer allowed to \nmake payments. He provided documentation of a loan-rehabilitation program, and indicated \nthat, because he is in graduate school, he is not currently required to make payments. After \nconsidering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (GE 1), and AE A, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old dual citizen of his native Mexico and the United States \nsince his U.S. naturalization in March 2009. He began working as an engineer in the U.S. \ndefense industry in December 2016, and in December 2018, he submitted a Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF 86) seeking his first DOD clearance. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States at age 23 after a difficult childhood and \nyears of personal hardship in Mexico. Applicant was mistreated by his mother, who blamed \nhim for her divorce from his father. After he ran away from her home at age 13 or 14, he \nlived with his father and then an uncle for a few months until he was taken in by a family \nthat owned a factory that manufactured handbags. He stayed with the family for three \n\n4 \n \nyears, and worked in their family business for over two years. In his late teens, he moved to \nMexico City where he resumed his schooling at the junior high level, but he struggled to \nsupport himself and stayed only a year before returning to his previous locale. In \nSeptember 1989, he married his first wife, a native of Mexico. After several years, his visa \nwas approved to immigrate to the United States, and he lawfully emigrated in December \n1989. He became a U.S. permanent resident in December 2000. (GE 1; AE A.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s knowledge of English was limited when he came to the United States. He \nsupported himself over the years through various employments, including as a baker, car \nwasher, salesman, janitor, waiter, taco maker, and gardener (AE A), although the dates for \neach job were not provided. In June 2001, Applicant and his first wife separated, and they \nwere divorced in May 2005. (GE 2.) \n \nIn approximately 2000, Applicant began studies at a community college toward an \nassociate\u2019s degree in liberal arts. Applicant lacked any formal education and had to take \nremedial classes. He demonstrated an interest in and facility with mathematics. (GE 1.) He \nvolunteered at the college\u2019s tutorial center where he became friendly with another student. \nIn May 2003, Applicant began living with this student and his family, and their home served \nas Applicant\u2019s primary residence while in college. (GEs 1-2; AE A.) Applicant supported \nhimself as a math tutor. In the spring of 2004, with the support and assistance of two \nprofessors, he started a Math Club on campus. In the summer of 2004, Applicant \nparticipated in a program at a nearby public university (university X), which introduced him \nto hands-on research in science and engineering. In November 2004, Applicant began a \nteaching internship in mathematics at a local high school under a program sponsored by \nuniversity X. At age 38, in May 2005, he earned an associate\u2019s degree. At graduation, he \nwas given an award for excellence in performance by a student. (AE A.) \n \nIn August 2005, Applicant began studies at university X toward his bachelor\u2019s degree \nin electrical engineering. (GE 1.) Between August 2005 and September 2008, Applicant \nobtained 13 Federal student loans totaling $54,870 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.o). (GEs 3-5.) He also \ntook on three private student loans, of $3,000 in March 2007, $4,000 in July 2007, and \n$2,444 in May 2008. (GE 3.) From February 2006 to June 2009, Applicant worked as a \nresearch intern. In approximately July 2009, Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree. (GE \n2.) \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant married his current wife in Mexico. He adopted her \nson, who was born in June 2003. (GE 2.) His spouse and son remained in Mexico while \nApplicant lived on campus during first three years in college and then with a friend in an \napartment during the school weeks of his final year. (GEs 1-2.) \n \n After he graduated from college, Applicant was unemployed until September 2009, \nwhen he began working under a staffing contract as a sustaining engineer for a commercial \nelectronics company. In November 2011, he converted to a full-time employee. (GE 2.) \n \nIn June 2011, Applicant\u2019s spouse and son joined him in the United States. He rented \nan apartment for his family, and over the next few years, he furnished their home on credit. \n\n5 \n \nHe bought a leather sofa, flat televisions, and other items, including musical instruments. \n(GE 2.) Applicant paid his consumer credit-card and car-loan obligations according to their \naccount terms. His Federal student loans were current through April 2012. (GE 4.) \nApplicant obtained car loans for $21,505 in July 2012 and for $32,269 in August 2012. (GE \n1.) \n \n \nAround 2013, Applicant began to struggle financially. He made minimum payments \non some accounts and skipped payments on some accounts, which led to increased \nbalances due to penalties. (GE 1.) Applicant was 120 days past due on his Federal student \nloans as of June 2013. (GE 4.) \n \n \nAfter his Federal student loans (then totaling approximately $75,361 due to interest \nand collection fees) were placed for collection, Applicant entered into a student-loan \nrehabilitation program in February 2015. His $170 monthly payments were automatically \ndeducted from his pay for eight months. He successfully completed the rehabilitation \nprogram, but then could not keep up with the payments and again defaulted. (GE 1.) \n \n \nIn approximately May 2016, Applicant was laid off when his division was closed \ndown. (GE 1.) He found a job as a product development engineer for another commercial \ncompany but left that employment under mutual agreement in July 2016 over an issue \ninvolving certification of a unit\u2019s performance. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed for the next four to five months except for part-time \njanitorial work. He primarily supported the family by running up debt on his credit cards. \n(GEs 2-3.) His and his spouse\u2019s rent at that time was $1,365 per month. In December \n2016, Applicant moved to a Midwestern state without his spouse and son for a job as an \napplication engineer with a defense contractor. He continued to pay his spouse\u2019s rent while \nincurring his own expenses in his new locale. Applicant indicates that he paid rent and \nutilities for two apartments for about seven or eight months until the lease for his spouse\u2019s \napartment ended and she and their son joined him in his new locale. Available lease \ndocumentation shows that their lease ran from November 1, 2015, through October 31, \n2016, when it became a month-to-month tenancy. (GE 1.)  Applicant has been living at his \ncurrent address since February 2017. (GE 2.) \n  \nApplicant demonstrated an \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d to learn about new concepts and \nimmediately apply it to his work. Before long, he outgrew his position for which he was hired \nand became a design engineer in an engineering services group. (GE 1.) In November \n2017, Applicant began working for his current employer. The job promised more complexity \nand paid him 30% more than his salary with his previous employer. (GE 2.) \n \nIn June 2018, a collection entity billed him $83,315 for his defaulted Federal student \nloans. Some $16,309 of the debt was for collection fees. Applicant requested the \nopportunity to rehabilitate his student loans, but he objected to the repayment amount. He \nrequested an alternative repayment based on reported joint income with his spouse of \n$3,300 per month but $3,305 in monthly expenses, which included $900 in housing costs. \n(GE 2.) \n\n6 \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant was offered a position with a defense contractor that \nrequired him to obtain a security clearance. On December 17, 2018, Applicant completed \nand certified to the accuracy of an SF 86. Although a report of his February 2019 subject \ninterview indicates that he was employed by the defense contractor sponsoring him for a \nsecurity clearance, his W-2 form for 2019 and other evidence indicate that he still works for \nthe company that hired him in November 2017. (GE 2; AE A.) On his SF 86, Applicant \nresponded affirmatively to an inquiry into whether, in the last seven years, he had failed to \nfile or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. He indicated \nthat he filed his returns, but with respect to tax year 2013, he filed his returns \u201cvery close\u201d to \nthe due date for that tax year, but that he received his W-2 form late from a part-time job. \nHe indicated that he filed an update the following year. He reported that he had owed \n$1,476 in Federal income taxes for 2013; $4,012 in Federal and $324 in state income taxes \nfor 2016; and $4,464 in Federal and $594 state income taxes for 2017. He explained that \nhis Federal and state tax delinquencies for 2016 resulted from his failure to timely pay \nincome taxes on his part-time income from his janitorial business, and that he had failed to \nmake timely payments on an installment agreement with the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS). He cited the cost of maintaining separate residences for himself and his spouse \nwhile he was working in the Midwest as the reason for his tax delinquencies for tax year \n2017. However, he explained that all of his delinquent income taxes had been paid by \nOctober 2018. (GE 1.) \n \nTax documents in the record show that Applicant entered into an installment \nagreement with the IRS in early 2016 to repay his tax liability for 2013. He made a $180 \npayment on March 20, 2016, and a $300 payment on June 6, 2016. On June 8, 2016, the \nIRS billed his installment of $300 on a balance of $1,562 for tax year 2013. Applicant \ndefaulted on that agreement. In 2018, he entered into an installment agreement with the \nIRS to address his tax debt for tax year 2017 at $150 a month. He provided evidence of \nFederal tax payments of $150 on June 6, 2018, $150 on September 15, 2018, and $735 on \nSeptember 25, 2018, under his installment agreement. On September 25, 2018, Applicant \nmade separate lump-sum credit-card payments, inclusive of service fees, of $1,505 for tax \nyear 2013, $4,091 for tax year 2016, and $4,552 for tax year 2017, which resolved his \nFederal tax debts. (GE 1.) \n \nSometime before February 27, 2018, Applicant requested an installment agreement \nto repay his state income tax liabilities (tax year not specified) at $100 a month. He \nsubmitted the paperwork on March 14, 2018, and he made a $100 payment on June 20, \n2018, although it is unclear whether he was under an established installment agreement. \nOn September 25, 2018, he made lump-sum credit-card payments of $330 for tax year \n2016 and $607 for 2017, which resolved his state tax debts. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant also responded affirmatively on his SF 86 to an inquiry concerning any \ncurrent delinquency on a Federal debt, and he listed $83,463 in student-loan debts that \nwere in a loan-rehabilitation program that was close to being completed. He explained that \nhe was responsible for the \u201cbad organization\u201d of his income between 2013 and 2017, but \nthat after rehabilitating his student loans, he planned to pay off his accounts, reduce his \nfamily\u2019s living expenses, and diligently manage his family\u2019s budget. He added that he was \n\n7 \n \nworking hard toward possibly being promoted for the income that would bring to enable him \nto repay his student loans faster. He expressed his understanding that that his student-loan \ndelinquencies could be seen as carelessness or a failure to commit to resolving them on his \npart. He requested the opportunity to solve the matter, and mentioned some of the \nhardships over the years that he endured to obtain his education. (GE 2.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on January 17, 2019, revealed that Applicant was \nmaking timely payments on his three private student loans with balances totaling $4,528, \nalthough the loans had been 90 days past due in April 2017. He was also making timely \nmonthly payments of $380 and $591 respectively on two joint car loans obtained in May \n2016 for $21,738 (balance $10,645) and $33,850 (balance $17,964). His had three active \ncredit-card accounts with outstanding balances totaling $2,442 that he was repaying on \ntime. His Federal student loans were in collection status. (GE 3.) \n \nOn February 20, 2019, Applicant had a telephone interview with an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The investigator\u2019s report of \nthat interview indicates that Applicant responded affirmatively when asked whether, in the \nlast seven years, he had failed to file Federal and state income tax returns, and that he \nstated he did not file his taxes in 2013, 2016, and 2017 because he was worried he was \ngoing to owe a big tax bill and would not have enough money to survive. However, he had \npaid all his tax bills in full as of October 25, 2018. He admitted owing student-loan debts, \nbut indicated that he had started repaying them at $500 [sic] per month in December 2018. \nHe characterized his financial situation as \u201cgetting better.\u201d (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant rehabilitated his student loans, and they were transferred to a Federal \nstudent-loan servicer in late January 2019. At that time, he owed principal balances totaling \n$54,870 and $13,068 in interest. In February 2019, he paid $60 toward his Federal student \nloans. He made $350 payments in March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, and July 2019. \nThere is no evidence that he made a payment in June 2019. In August 2019, Applicant paid \n$175, and in September 2019, he paid $100 to bring his balance to $67,954. Some $1,735 \nof his payments went to interest in 2019. His student loans are currently deferred with a \ntotal balance of approximately $69,402. (GE 1.)  \n \nIn the summer of 2018, Applicant began graduate studies in electrical engineering to \nimprove his earnings potential and to better contribute to the nation\u2019s technical \nadvancement in communications. He was admitted to the program conditioned on him \ncompleting nine or more hours of graduate work with a cumulative grade point average of \nat least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. He completed an independent study for two credit hours that \nsummer. During the fall term 2018, he earned six hours credit. He took and passed four \nhours in the summer of 2019, so by the fall of 2019, he was considered to be in good \nstanding. That fall, he enrolled in two graduate-level courses with two labs but withdrew \nfrom one of the courses and its associated lab because of his commitments at his full-time \njob. (GE 1; AE A.) For the spring semester 2020, he is presently taking one graduate level \ncourse, a related lab, and thesis work. He plans to resume his student-loan payments in \nSeptember 2020 when he finishes graduate school, which is being paid for by his current \nemployer. (GE 1.) \n\n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s April 2019 credit report shows that his Federal student loans are deferred \nuntil May 2022. He continued to make timely payments on his three open revolving charge \naccounts with balances totaling $4,981; his three private student loans with balances \ntotaling $3,891; and his joint car loans with balances of $5,902 and $10,004. He had no \nnew credit accounts. (GE 5.)  \n \nApplicant and his spouse filed their joint Federal income tax return on time for tax \nyear 2019. Applicant\u2019s W-2 shows earned wages of $83,451, but social security wages of \n$86,600. He and his spouse\u2019s earned wages totaled $105,749. They overpaid their Federal \nincome taxes by approximately $6,750. (GE 1.) There is no evidence of what they did with \ntheir refund. In April 2020, Applicant indicated that he and his spouse are taking steps to \nsave money by cooking at home and purchasing only items they need. (AE A.) \n \nA co-worker who has worked alongside Applicant on multiple projects over the last \ntwo years attests that Applicant has always been willing to go the extra mile to ensure \nsuccessful outcomes at work. Applicant provides support to advance the technical \nunderstanding for manufacturing technicians as designs move into the manufacturing \nphase. This co-worker considers Applicant to be a crucial team member. As Applicant \ncontinues his engineering studies, he has shared his knowledge across their division. (GE \n1.) \n                                                                                                                                              \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n9 \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances in \na way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a nexus \nbetween proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. \n\n10 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2013, 2016, and 2017. Guideline F security concerns are established \nwhen an individual fails to comply with his tax-filing or tax-payment obligations. The \nevidence shows that Applicant owed delinquent Federal income taxes for tax years 2013, \n2016, and 2017, and state income taxes for tax years 2016 and 2017. However, there is \nconflicting evidence as to whether Applicant failed to file timely tax returns for those tax \nyears. On his SF 86, Applicant checked off \u201cPay\u201d in response to the question \u201cDid you fail \nto file, pay as required, or both?\u201d with respect to 2013, 2016, and 2017. He stated, \u201cI have \nnot failed to file for federal taxes,\u201d but added that he had filed for tax year 2013 very close \nto the due date, which could be taken as an admission that he filed late. The OPM \ninvestigator\u2019s summary of Applicant\u2019s February 2019 PSI includes an admission by \nApplicant that he failed to timely file Federal and state taxes \u201cin 2013, 2016, and 2017\u201d for \nthe stated reason that he was running low on money and did not file because he was \nworried he was going to owe a big tax bill. Applicant entered into an installment agreement \nwith the IRS in June 2018 to repay his Federal income taxes for tax year 2017. His efforts \nto resolve his tax liabilities for 2013 and 2016 were not so timely. The timing of his \npayments and his admissions during his PSI and in response to the SOR to having failed to \nfile timely Federal and state income tax returns support a finding that Applicant failed to \ntimely file his tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2016, and likely also 2017. Disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d \napplies. \n \nThe evidence implicating AG \u00b6 19(f) with respect to the failure to timely pay taxes is \nclearly documented and not subject to reasonable dispute. While the Government argued in \nthe FORM that Applicant did not adequately explain his failure to pay his taxes on time, the \nfailure to timely pay (as opposed to timely failure to file returns) was not alleged in the SOR, \nand thus it is not considered as a basis for disqualification purposes. \n \nApplicant\u2019s default of 13 Federal student loans with principal balances totaling \n$54,870 establishes disqualifying conditions AGs \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  The evidence shows that Applicant \nmade no payments on his Federal student loans after April 2012, and they were referred for \ncollection. He apparently made $170 payments for nine months in 2015 to rehabilitate the \nloans only to again default, albeit he was unemployed during part of that time. As of June \n2018, his Federal student loans were again in collection status. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his late tax filings and delinquent student loans. Application of the \naforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20. One or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in \npart: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n11 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \n \n \nAs noted by the Government in the FORM, the Appeal Board has held that the \nfailure to timely file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying \nwith well-established rules and regulations. This is so particularly when an individual \nrepeatedly fails to fulfill his legal obligation. See ISCR 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 2016). AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply because of the repetitive nature and recency of his tax problems and \nstudent-loan defaults. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that Applicant\u2019s late tax filing for tax year 2013 \nwas caused by his untimely receipt of his W-2 for part-time janitorial work, which was \noutside of his control. His late tax filings for 2016 and 2017 were due to the financial \ndistress brought on by his unemployment for five months in 2016 and his relocation to the \nMidwest for employment in December 2016. In addition to moving costs, he incurred \nexpenses for two households in 2017 for several months until his spouse and son joined \nhim in his new locale. However, financial problems do not justify his failure to timely comply \nwith his tax-filing obligations, which exist independent of whether he could pay the taxes \nowed. Concerning his student loans, he initially defaulted in 2012, which predated his \nunemployment and relocation in 2016. He gave priority to decorating his house with \u201cnice \nfurniture, such as [a] leather couch, flat TVs, and other items including musical \ninstruments,\u201d and to buying a nice car. His credit report shows that he obtained car loans \nfor $21,505 in July 2012 and for $32,269 in August 2012 while his student loans went \nunpaid. After he rehabilitated his Federal student loans in 2015, he and his spouse took on \nnew car loans of $21,738 and $33,850 in May 2016. With car payments totaling $971 each \nmonth and his unemployment in the fall of 2016, it is perhaps not surprising that he could \n\n12 \n \nnot afford his student-loan payments. For full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant is \nrequired to demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, and in that \nregard his evidence falls short. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are established in whole or in part with respect to \nresolution of his tax issues. Applicant did not provide the dates for when his returns were \nfiled, but payment records show that he made efforts to pay his tax liabilities starting in \n2016 when he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS for his 2013 taxes. While \nsome concern arises because of his failure to make consistent payments toward his tax \ndebts, he resolved all of his past-due taxes in late September 2018, before he applied for a \nsecurity clearance in December 2018 and well before the SOR was issued in January \n2020. His Federal income tax return for tax year 2019 was prepared by a tax service in \nJanuary 2020, so his late tax filings, while not condoned, appear to have been situational \nand not reflective of an unwillingness to comply with that important obligation. He is likely to \nfile his tax returns on time in the future.  \n \n \nAs to whether AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are satisfied with respect to his student loans, \nApplicant\u2019s disregard of the loans from April 2012 until February 2015 weighs against him. \nWhile his rehabilitation of his student loans in 2015 is viewed favorably, his case for \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) is undermined somewhat because he allowed the loans to go \ninto collection status before taking action in 2015 and because he defaulted on the loans \nafter they had been rehabilitated. He has a stronger case under AG \u00b6 20(c). He followed \nthrough with a second opportunity at rehabilitating the loans by making the payments \nrequired between June 2018 and January 2019, and then making $350 monthly payments \non his rehabilitated loans from March 2019 through May 2019 and in July 2019. He \nprovided no explanation for why he did not make a payment in June 2019, but his credit \nreport shows that the loans are currently deferred until May 2022. Applicant explained that \nafter being told that had a grace period on his loans because of his graduate studies, he \nmade some payments on his loan through the year. His graduate school transcript shows \nthat he returned to school in the summer of 2019 after taking off the spring semester of \n2019, so the loans were likely deferred around that time. A recent credit report of March \n2020 shows that his Federal student loans totaling $69,396 are rated as current.  \n \n \nThe salient issue going forward is whether Applicant can be counted on to make his \nstudent-loan payments in the future. His Federal student-loan indebtedness is substantial in \nrelation to his household income of $105,749, but when he was making payments, he did \nnot fall behind on his other financial obligations, including his joint car loans and credit \ncards. He now manages his day-to-day financial obligations responsibly. He credibly \nexpressed an intent to resume repaying his student loans as soon as he finishes his \nmaster\u2019s program in September 2020. His March 2020 credit report and the evidence \nsubmitted in response to the SOR show that he has his financial issues under control. \n\n13 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nIn many ways, Applicant is an American success story. As detailed in his response \nto the FORM and in letters from former professors, he endured several hardships over the \nyears. While they reflect strength of character and certainly a willingness to work hard to \nachieve his goals, they do not excuse or extenuate a failure to meet tax deadlines or default \nof Federal debts. Even in instances where an applicant has corrected his tax and financial \nissues and is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, I have to consider an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of his prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-00221 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016) citing ISCR Case No. 14-01894 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant raised considerable security concerns by his failures to timely \ncomply with his income tax and Federal student loan obligations. \n \n \nThat being said, Applicant has never denied his responsibility for \u201call of [his] failures.\u201d \nHis candor and cooperation with the security clearance process, coupled with his steps to \naddress his tax and student loan issues well before the SOR was issued, reflect positively \non his security clearance eligibility. He has been a valuable contributor to his employer and \nis pursuing his master\u2019s degree to better contribute to the nation\u2019s technical advancements \nin communications. He and his spouse have taken steps to improve their financial situation \nby monitoring their spending. After considering all of the evidence of record, I conclude that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n\n14 \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 18, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 16, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On January 30, 2020, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 8. He was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \n\n \n2 \n \nFebruary 3, 2020, and timely submitted his response on February 29, 2020, to which \nthe Government did not object. Applicant did not object to any of the Items included in \nthe FORM. Items 1 through 3 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 4 through 8 are \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s FORM response included documents that I admitted \ninto evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through M. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 11, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Matter \n \nItem 5 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 5. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 5 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise any objection to Item 5 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nthat Item 5 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not raise an \nobjection to Item 5 in his FORM response or otherwise. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He has two adult children from his first marriage. He \nand his second wife have been married since 2003. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1984. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1984 through 1986 and from \n1990 through 2004. Since 2004, he has worked intermittently for a government \ncontracting company owned by his wife (Company A). He was granted a DOD security \nclearance in 2008. He has worked full time for Company A since 2018. Another \ncompany, for whom he has not begun working, sponsored this pending security \nclearance application. (FORM response; Items 4, 5) \n  \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts totaling $67,772, which were \nconfirmed by the credit reports. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the \nalleged debts, but disputed that any of them remained unresolved. However, the record \nevidence established that only three SOR debts had been resolved. (Items 3, 6-8) \n \nApplicant initiated contact with the creditor of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \n($33,297 unsecured-loan account) in November and December 2019. He proffered that, \nbecause the account was \u201cclosed,\u201d the creditor did not require an official payment plan \nand would accept a monthly payment of \u201cany amount,\u201d which could only be scheduled \nthree months at a time. In December 2019, he scheduled a $25 monthly payment to be \ndebited in January, February, and March 2020. His February 2020 credit report \nreflected that he made one $26 payment. This debt remains unresolved. (AE A; AE J; \nAE M at 3) \n \nApplicant negotiated a settlement with the creditor of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b ($9,969 secured-loan account) in February 2020. He agreed to pay a total of $6,604 \nvia monthly payments of $660 for 10 months beginning in March 2020. He provided \n\n \n3 \n \nproof of the settlement agreement, but not of any payments. This debt remains \nunresolved. (AE F) \n \nApplicant initiated contact with the creditor of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \n($8,664 unsecured-loan account) in December 2019 and February 2020. He proffered \nthat the creditor would not accept any payments pursuant to a statute of limitations \nunder state law. This debt remains unresolved. (AE A, L) \n \nApplicant negotiated a settlement with the creditor of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d ($5,871 credit-card account) in November 2019 and February 2020. He agreed to \npay $143 per month from November 2019 through February 2020. He increased the \npayment to $172 per month beginning March 2020 in order to have the account paid off \nby December 2020. Applicant provided proof of a $143 payment made in January 2020. \nHis January 2020 statement and February 2020 credit report reflected balances of \n$4,290 and $4,146, respectively. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 8 at 1; AE C; AE \nM at 5) \n \nApplicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,369 unsecured-loan \naccount), SOR \u00b6 1.f ($2,540 credit-card account), and SOR \u00b6 1.g ($935 credit-card \naccount) in January 2020, March 2019, and September 2019, respectively. (AE G, K; \nAE M at 3, 8; Item 8 at 3) \n \nApplicant paid $100 per month to the creditor of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h \n($3,127 credit-card account) between June 2019 and September 2019. As of February \n2020, Applicant asserted that the creditor stopped accepting payments due to a statute \nof limitations under state law. This debt remains unresolved. (AE H) \n \nIn November 2019 and February 2020, Applicant initiated contact with the \ncreditor of a $1,230 credit-card debt not alleged in the SOR. He negotiated a settlement \nto pay $52 in February 2020, $77 per month between March and November 2020, and \none payment of $69 in December 2020. He provided proof of the $52 payment. This \ndebt remains unresolved. (AE A, B) \n \nIn November 2019, he initiated contact with the creditor of a $15,082 loan \naccount not alleged in the SOR. He negotiated a settlement to pay $8,353 via monthly \npayments of $232 beginning in October 2019. He provided proof of a $232 payment \nmade in February 2020. This debt remains unresolved. I will consider any unalleged \ndebts only for the purposes of evaluating mitigation and the whole person concept. (AE \nA, I; Item 5 at 4) \n \nThe SOR debts became delinquent between 2016 and 2017. Without providing \nspecific details or corroborating documents, Applicant attributed those debts to income \nlosses that he and his wife suffered between 2014 and 2017. Following a 2014 work \ninjury, his wife has struggled with chronic health issues that have affected her ability to \nwork. She was initially rendered unable to work for approximately eight months. Since \nthen, she has only been able to resume part-time work, which does not provide \u201cany \nsignificant income to the household.\u201d Additionally, Applicant spent several months in \n\n \n4 \n \n2016 working remotely to help his mother care for his ill father and, once he passed \naway, settle the estate. During that time, he provided unspecified financial assistance to \nhis mother. Finally, Applicant was laid off by his employer of five years in July 2017. \nWhile he regained employment in October 2017, he did so at a lesser salary. (Items 3, \n4; FORM response) \n \nApplicant previously experienced financial problems due to Company A\u2019s \nfinancial instability following the 2008 global recession and 2013 federal government \nsequestration. A steady decline in contract awards beginning in 2009 eventually led to a \ncomplete loss in 2013. In order to try to keep Company A afloat in the interim, he and \nhis wife incurred significant debts. Without providing specific details or corroborating \ndocuments, he averred that he was able to manage and eventually resolve those debts \nwith the assistance of a debt consolidation company. Applicant has chosen to manage \nthe SOR debts on his own with his family\u2019s increased income. (Item 5 at 6; FORM \nresponse at 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife received a worker\u2019s compensation settlement of an unspecified \namount, which \u201chelped bridge [them] in 2016.\u201d Without providing a specific breakdown \nor corroborating documents, he asserted that he and his wife settled or paid off \napproximately $870,000 of debt between 2009 and 2019 (prioritizing his wife\u2019s debts \nfirst and then their joint debts), including short-selling their home, paying non-delinquent \nfederal income taxes to the IRS pursuant to an installment agreement, and \u201cmany other\u201d \nunspecified secured and unsecured debts. He declared that, as of at least January 2020 \n(and for a prior period not specified in the record), his wife has been receiving monthly \ndisability compensation \u201cin excess of $3,000\u201d after qualifying for a 100% disability rating \nfrom the U.S. Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs for an injury sustained while she served in \nthe Army. In February 2020, Applicant described his income from Company A as \u201cmore \nincome\u201d than he had been receiving from previous employers for whom he worked \nbetween 2012 and 2018. He provided no more specific details about his and his wife\u2019s \nrelevant income history. The record evidence also contained scant corroborating details \nand documents concerning his family\u2019s relevant expense history. (Item 3; FORM \nResponse) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current repayment strategy has been influenced by a nationally \nrecognized financial counseling program. He explained that the goal of the program\u2019s \nsnowball plan is to establish a small savings first, and then tackle each debt from \nsmallest to largest. He attributed his delay in resolving the SOR debts primarily to a lack \nof sufficient income and his creditors\u2019 unwillingness to accept partial payments. He \ndeclared that he had enough income to begin addressing his SOR debts as of October \n2019 and that, as of February 2020, he had budgeted $1,142 per month to pay off his \nSOR debts. (FORM Response; Item 3) \n \n \nIn his FORM response, Applicant maintained that he had \u201cnot felt this confident in \n[his] career or financial future in ten years.\u201d He anticipated that Company A\u2019s income \nopportunities will continue growing. He wished to remain eligible for a security clearance \nso that he can \u201ccontribute at an even greater level to our nation\u2019s success and security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nHe volunteers in a leadership position with an organization involved with national policy \nand infrastructure resilience readiness. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \n\n \n6 \n \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). \n \n \nThe following are potentially applicable factors that could mitigate the security \nconcerns raised in the SOR: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n7 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g \u2013 the latter two \nbefore the SOR was issued. Thus, I find those allegations in his favor. However, he did \nnot meet his burden to establish mitigation as to the remaining SOR debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has a significant amount of debt that \nremains unresolved, including SOR debts totaling $60,928 and unalleged debts totaling \n$16,312. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant proffered compelling circumstances that \nhave undoubtedly had both a monetary and nonmonetary impact on his family. \nHowever, he did not meet his burden to establish that the SOR debts were accrued \n(and have persisted) largely due to those circumstances, or that he acted responsibly to \naddress them.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant is commended for working with a \ndebt consolidation company to address a prior period of financial difficulty and for \nutilizing a nationally recognized financial counseling program to develop a debt \nresolution plan to address his SOR debts. However, he did not establish that his \nfinances are under control at this time.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. While reliance on the running of his state\u2019s \nstatute of limitations could be a legally permissible option for Applicant to avoid repaying \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h, it would not demonstrate a good-faith effort \nwithin the meaning of AG \u00b6 20(d). However, he is credited with his efforts to resolve \ndebts both before and after issuance of the SOR. In March 2019, Applicant resolved a \n$2,540 credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f). From June 2019 through September 2019, he paid \n$400 toward resolving a $3,217 credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). In September 2019, he \nresolved a $935 credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Between November and December 2019, \nhe initiated contact with the creditors of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. In \nJanuary 2020, he paid $26 toward resolving the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In February \n2020, he paid $232 toward resolving the unalleged $15,082 loan debt. From November \n2019 through February 2020, he paid at least $572 toward resolving a $5,871 credit-\ncard debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and documents in the record suggest that he may have made \nadditional payments totaling $1,143. Due to the lack of specific information and \ncorroborating documents, I am unable to fully consider the $870,000 of debts that he \n\n \n8 \n \npurportedly resolved between 2009 and 2019 and how it may have impacted his ability \nto repay his SOR debts. \n \nEven if the evidence was sufficient for me to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation did, in fact, preclude him from repaying his SOR debts until October 2019, the \nrecord evidence falls short of establishing a meaningful track record of regular and \ntimely payments or otherwise demonstrating that he is able to follow through with his \nplan for repaying the remaining SOR debts; and that his indebtedness is not likely to \nrecur. Given that the SOR debts became delinquent between 2016 and 2017, \nApplicant\u2019s delay in addressing his debts raises questions, about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment not sufficiently answered in the record, that I must \nresolve in the Government\u2019s favor. \n \nI have considered the progress that Applicant has made in tackling his delinquent \ndebts and the fact that he is not required to be debt-free in order to qualify for a security \nclearance. However, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant \nhas mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 42 years old and employed by a DOD contractor as an electrician since March 2007. He earned his associate\u2019s degree in 2002. He was married in 2007, and his divorce was finalized in 2018. Applicant listed a daughter, age 15, on the 2018 SCA. He is requesting national security eligibility to perform specific employment duties. (Item 5) Under Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was charged with criminal offenses, primarily of a violent nature, on eight different occasions between 1997 and 2018. (Items 1, 4) SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was charged with assault and brandishing a firearm in approximately October 1997. Applicant told the investigator during his July 2018 background interview that he was at a restaurant and was approached by a male accusing Applicant of sleeping with his girlfriend. The man tackled Applicant to the ground and a fight ensued between the men. Applicant claimed he fought the man in self-defense. Based on the arrest records in evidence, Applicant was arrested for these offenses in September 1997. Both charges were subsequently dismissed in October 1997. This is the only allegation he denied in his SOR response.

He \nhas a history of violent criminal conduct, and he provided no evidence of mitigation, to \ninclude participation in an anger-management program or successful rehabilitation. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 12, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On January 23, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) [or DCSA CAF] issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal \nconduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 2, 2020. He admitted seven out of eight \nSOR allegations alleged under Guideline J. SOR \u00b6 1.a was denied because Applicant \nclaimed this criminal offense was confused with the offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He \n\n \n2 \n \n \ndid not provide any additional documentation with his SOR response. Applicant \nrequested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing. (Item 4) On April 13, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM), containing 14 Items, was mailed to Applicant on April 13, 2020. The \nFORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant did not provide any documentation. Applicant did not object to Items 1 \nthrough 14, and I admitted all of the Government's exhibits into the record. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Office assigned the case to me on July 28, \n2020.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact:  Applicant is 42 years old and \nemployed by a DOD contractor as an electrician since March 2007. He earned his \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2002. He was married in 2007, and his divorce was finalized in \n2018. Applicant listed a daughter, age 15, on the 2018 SCA. He is requesting national \nsecurity eligibility to perform specific employment duties. (Item 5) \n \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was charged with criminal \noffenses, primarily of a violent nature, on eight different occasions between 1997 and \n2018. (Items 1, 4)\n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was charged with assault and brandishing a \nfirearm in approximately October 1997. Applicant told the investigator during his July \n2018 background interview that he was at a restaurant and was approached by a male \naccusing Applicant of sleeping with his girlfriend. The man tackled Applicant to the \nground and a fight ensued between the men. Applicant claimed he fought the man in \nself-defense. Based on the arrest records in evidence, Applicant was arrested for these \noffenses in September 1997. Both charges were subsequently dismissed in October \n1997. This is the only allegation he denied in his SOR response. The adverse \ninformation is verified by Applicant\u2019s notarized response to interrogatories, criminal \nrecords from the sheriff, and his Federal Bureau of Information (FBI) record. (Items 6, 7, \n14) There is sufficient evidence to support this allegation, and due to the dissimilar \nfacts, I do not find this criminal offense was confused with the offense set forth below.  \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for the criminal conduct concerning his arrest in \nAugust 1998 for assault and battery and brandishing a firearm. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He said that \nhe was dropping off his girlfriend at her job when two unknown males walked up to his \nvehicle and started harassing him and his girlfriend. Applicant grabbed his gun, but \nclaimed that he never pointed it at anyone. The two males contacted the police who \ntook Applicant into custody. He was convicted of both charges, sentenced to ten days in \njail, and fined. (Items 4, 6, 14) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that in December 2005, Applicant was charged with \nintimidation and a weapons offense. His wife reported to police that they had been \ninvolved in an argument around 1:30 a.m. when Applicant pulled out a semi-automatic \npistol. Although his wife denied that he had pointed the gun at her, she stated that he \nchambered a round in the gun and threatened to kill her. Applicant was arrested, but the \ncharges against him were subsequently nolle prossed. (Items 4, 8, 14) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was charged with simple assault in January \n2008. He was riding in his truck with a woman he had been dating for about one month. \nThey got into an argument over politics. Applicant became furious and ordered the \nwoman out of his truck. When she refused, he pulled over and attempted to push the \nwoman out of the truck. He eventually dropped her off at a convenience store with a \nswollen lip, and she reported the incident to police. Applicant was charged with simple \nassault, but the charge was later dropped due to the victim\u2019s failure to cooperate with \nthe prosecution. (Items 4, 9) \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for the criminal conduct concerning his charge \nin July 2014 for assault and battery on a family member. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) He and his wife \nreported to police that they were arguing when he pushed her in the back and caused \nher to hit a wall and injure her hand. Applicant drove his wife to the emergency room \nwhere she reported the incident to the medical staff and advised that she was afraid of \nher husband. Police were called to the hospital, and Applicant admitted he had pushed \nhis wife to get her off of him. He was charged with simple assault, but the charge was \nsubsequently nolle prossed. (Items 4, 6, 10) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that in approximately August 2015, Applicant was charged with \ndestruction of property (value less than $1,000). Applicant went to his mother-in-law\u2019s \nhouse to pick up his daughter. He honked the horn, but no one came out of the house. \nAs he drove out of the driveway, he spun his tires and rocks from the gravel driveway \ncaused damage to his mother-in-law\u2019s property. He was charged with destruction of \nproperty (value less than $1,000), but the charge was later dismissed. (Items 4, 5, 6, 11) \n \nThe SOR alleges that in about July 2017, Applicant was charged with felony \ncriminal history false statement. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) He ordered an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle \nfrom an online store. As part of the purchase process, Applicant was required to fill out \na form wherein he was asked about his criminal history. At the time, his wife had an \nactive protective order against him that he failed to disclose. He claimed that he thought \nthe protective order had already expired. He was charged with felony criminal history \nfalse statement, and the charge was subsequently dismissed. (Items 4, 5, 6, 12)  \n \nIn approximately January 2018, Applicant\u2019s wife was at his home, although they \nwere in the process of getting a divorce. He arrived home around 2:30 a.m. and became \nphysically violent with his wife because he suspected she had communicated with \nanother man on the phone. He jumped on her, punched in the back of the head, and \npushed her head into a pillow (making it difficult for her to breathe), punched her in the \nstomach, and threatened to kill her. His wife could not call police because Applicant had \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntaken her phone away. The next morning Applicant was still threatening her, so she \nsent a note with their daughter going to school which requested the police be called and \nsent to the house. The police report identified bruises on his wife\u2019s wrist, abrasions on \nher right forearm, scratches on the back of her neck, and a bruise on her right cheek \nbone. All injuries were photographed. Applicant was charged with assault and battery \nand an emergency protective order was issued. Prosecution was deferred until April \n2020, and if there were no further incidents, the charge would be dismissed. (Items 4, 6, \n13) \n \nApplicant noted in his SOR response that there were several criminal offenses \nthat did not result in a final conviction. He did not provide any information about \ncounseling or participation in an anger-management program. He has presented no \nfavorable evidence of his employment record or community involvement. (Item 4) \n \n                                                    Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:   \n  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nBetween 1997 and 2018, Applicant was charged on eight occasions with criminal \noffenses, predominantly of a violent nature. AG\u00b6 31(b) is established.   \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant:   \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and   \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s eight criminal offenses occurred between 1997 and 2018. Although \nhe is now divorced from his wife, the evidence does not justify a conclusion that \nrecurrence of the violence with his now ex-wife or any other individual is unlikely. \nApplicant\u2019s history shows that he has a vehement nature, and he has not provided any \nevidence of treatment or successful rehabilitation. He was on probation for his 2018 \noffense until earlier this year. Too little time has passed since the latest criminal \nconduct. I find that the behavior which resulted in his criminal charges is likely to recur \nand casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) was \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and employed by a DOD contractor as an electrician \nsince March 2007. He has a 15-year-old daughter and was divorced from his wife in \n2018. He has a history of violent criminal conduct. Applicant chose not to submit any \nmitigating evidence with his FORM response.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude he failed to mitigate the security concerns alleged under Guideline J, criminal \nconduct. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 11, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nThe DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines implemented on June 8, 2017 \n(AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 28, 2020, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 28, 2020. The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 (Items 1-3 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on May 26, \n2020. Applicant submitted documents (AE A-D) in response to the FORM. Both the \nGovernment\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s documents are admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 21, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted his 2013 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and \nresulting discharge, but denied the three charged-off debts and one collection account \nalleged in the SOR. The four delinquent debts totaled approximately $31,000. His \nadmission is adopted here as a finding of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. He has worked for federal contractors since September \n2014. He had periods of unemployment from August to November 2013 and from \nJanuary to July 2012. He served in both the Navy and Army for approximately 10 years \nand received honorable discharges. He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1985. He \nwas married for the fifth time in February 2018. The dates of his earlier marriages are: \n1979-1981; 1982-1987; 1989-1992; and 1992-2018. He has five adult children. (Item 4) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began when he was laid off from a senior \nexecutive position, which led to his filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013. The largest debt \nincluded in the bankruptcy was his mortgage. He was unable to pay his mortgage as a \nresult of his job loss. Applicant claims that the remaining SOR debts were incurred by \nhis fourth ex-wife. She revealed a drug addiction to opiates and several of the accounts \nwere opened to fund her drug usage. Applicant was unaware of the accounts until he \nwas made aware of these debts during his background investigation. This ex-wife faced \nseveral felony charges for criminal behavior. Applicant sought a divorce, which was \nfinalized in 2018. All the debts appear on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. (Items 3, 6, 8-10; \nAE A) \n \n \nApplicant documented that he enrolled into a debt resolution program (DRP) in \nDecember 2017 to address his delinquent debts. Under the DRP, Applicant began \npaying $542 monthly into a fund held by the DRP, which then would negotiate \nsettlements with Applicant\u2019s creditors. Applicant has paid into this account monthly \nsince February 2018. An account activity statement shows that the DRP has made \nregular payments on three of the SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d). All these payments \npredated the SOR. Additionally, payments were made on an account not listed in the \nSOR. Applicant\u2019s credit report documents that he disputed the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nHis credit report also shows that he is current on his student loan payments. (Item 3; AE \nA-D) \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had delinquent debts that were unpaid or unresolved. He also had \ndebts discharged through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013. I find both disqualifying \nconditions are raised.   \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy filing resulted from a loss of a job, which was a condition \nbeyond his control. Additionally, he divorced his fourth wife in 2018 when he discovered \nshe had become addicted to opioids and had opened and charged several credit cards \nto fund her addiction. This was also a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control. He acted \nresponsibly by hiring a DRP to arrange settlements for his delinquent accounts. Since \nFebruary 2018, he has made continuous monthly payments into the DRP, which have \nbeen used to make payments on three of his SOR debts. Applicant acted responsibly by \nseeking out the DRP to address his delinquent debts. He continues to make good-faith \nefforts to pay his delinquent debts. Applicant has formally disputed the fourth SOR debt \nwith his credit reporting service. Even if he loses this dispute, he can include this debt \ninto his DRP payment plan. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) all apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service, his job loss that led to bankruptcy, and his ex-wife\u2019s actions, which \nresulted in the SOR debts. Applicant established a reliable track record of financial \nstability by making his DRP payments since February 2018 and staying current on his \nstudent loan payments.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/22/2020 \nDecision \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns generated by his delinquent finances. Clearance \nis denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, and explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \nsecurity to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive);  and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made \non or after June 8, 2017. On December 27, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations except subparagraphs 1.d and 1.f. He requested a decision without a hearing. On March 25, \n2020, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) setting forth the Government\u2019s \nargument in support of the SOR, together with supporting documentation. Applicant received a copy of the \nFORM on March \n1 \n\n27, 2020, and was instructed to file any objections to this information, or to supplement the file within 30 days of \nreceipt. Applicant did not do so, whereupon the case was assigned to me on May 22, 2020.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old man with one child, age 18. He was married from 2000 to 2006. The marriage ended \nin divorce. (Item 1 at 15) He currently lives with his girlfriend in a legally-recognized domestic partnership. He has a \nhigh school diploma. He has been working for a defense contractor as a mechanical installer since 1998. (Item 1 at \n10) \nPer credit reports of December 2019 and May 2019, Applicant has approximately $24,000 of delinquent debt. \n(Items 4 and 5) Applicant is aware of these debts, but either contends that they were fraudulent, turned over to \ncollection agencies before he had an opportunity to satisfy them, or that his ex-wife incurred them, using credit cards \nthat she opened in his name without his knowledge or consent. (Item 1 at 4) He provided no documented proof \nsubstantiating the basis of these contentions. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive Branch has in regulating \naccess to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are required to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n2 \n\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality of an applicant's conduct \nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG 112(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG 1118, as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially overextended \nis at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nApplicant's history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG 1119(a), \"inability to satisfy \ndebts,\" and AG 11 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations.\" \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG 11 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, \ndivorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG 11 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant provided no evidence supporting his contention that the debts of concern to the \nDOD were fraudulent or incurred by his ex-wife, nor did he provide evidence of any steps that he \nplans to take to pay or otherwise resolve them. Under these circumstances, none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors when I evaluated the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n4 \n",

He did not provide copies of \nperformance evaluations or character references.    \n  \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling $32,717 as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment entered against Applicant in August 2018 for $13,849. In \nhis SOR response, he said he is paying $150 monthly to address this debt. In the \nsummary of Applicant\u2019s June 20, 2019 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal \nsubject interview (PSI), he said the vehicle was repossessed, and he will be making $150 \nmonthly payments until August 2024. (Item 5 at 2) Applicant\u2019s April 2, 2020 credit report, \nthe most recent credit report of record, indicates the current balance is $11,128. (Item 7 \nat 2) He is credited with mitigating this debt because he has an established payment plan \naddressing this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a judgment entered against Applicant in June 2019 for $7,161. \nApplicant and his spouse co-signed for this debt, which relates to purchase of a vehicle. \n(Item 3) In Applicant\u2019s June 20, 2019 OPM PSI, Applicant said the debt resulted from a \nrepossessed vehicle in 2017. (Item 5 at 3) Applicant and his spouse were divorced in \n2017, and she did not make payments. (Item 3) Applicant discussed payment \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \narrangements with the creditor; however, no payment arrangements have been \nestablished. (Id.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a child support debt for $5,266, and SOR \u00b6 1.e is a child support debt \nfor $864. As for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant \u201cwaited a year for DNA testing.\u201d (Item 3) \nChild support accrued beginning the date his third child was born. (Id.) After parentage \nwas established, an arrearage payment was added to his monthly child support payment, \nand the payment is made directly from his monthly income. (Id.) In Applicant\u2019s June 20, \n2019 OPM PSI, he said that he was paying child support for three children. (Item 5 at 2) \nAround September 2017, he fell behind on payments for two of his children while he was \nchanging jobs. (Id.) Applicant was unsure about the amount of his child support arrearage. \n(Id.) Applicant\u2019s April 2, 2020 credit report, the most recent credit report of record, \nindicates three child support accounts, and only one of them was delinquent for $4,758. \n(Item 7 at 4-5) Applicant is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($864) because \nhis credit report indicates it is not delinquent.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $3,109, and SOR \n\u00b6 1.g is a debt placed for collection for $679. Applicant said he had not made any \narrangements for these debts because of paying off other debts. He promised to take \ncare of these debts. (Item 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a debt placed for collection for $435. In Applicant\u2019s June 20, 2019 \nOPM PSI, Applicant said this credit card debt went to collections in 2014. (Item 5 at 3) \nApplicant discussed payment arrangements with the creditor; however, no payment \narrangements have been established. (Item 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a debt placed for collection for $632. Applicant discussed payment \narrangements with the creditor, and the creditor said he could establish payment \narrangements when he could afford to do so. (Item 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a debt placed for collection for $425. This debt resulted from a broken \nlease when Applicant was traveling for work. (Item 3) Applicant discussed payment \narrangements with the creditor, and he said he would make payment arrangements when \nhe could afford to do so. (Id.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a debt placed for collection for $297. In Applicant\u2019s June 20, 2019 \nOPM PSI, Applicant said the debt resulted when his vehicle was towed during \nrepossession. (Item 5 at 5) Applicant said he would make payment arrangements to pay \nthis debt when he can afford to do so. (Item 3)  \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant concluded, \u201cI believe I am trying my best, to [the \nextent] which my funds will allow [and] to take care of all [of] my debt. All the debt will be \ntaken care of, it just takes time.\u201d (Item 3) \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel noted the absence of corroborating or \nsupporting documentation of resolution of the SOR debts. Aside from Applicant\u2019s \nuncorroborated statements and the most recent credit report, there is no documentary \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nevidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise \nresolved any of the SOR debts. The record lacks corroborating or substantiating \ndocumentation and detailed explanations of the causes for his financial problems and \nother mitigating information. The FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the \nreceipt of the FORM \u201cin which to submit a documentary response setting forth \nobjections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you \ndo not file any objections or submit any additional information . . . your case will be \nassigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination based solely\u201d on the evidence \nset forth in this FORM. (FORM at 6 (emphasis added)) He did not respond to the FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \n \n Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling $32,717. Circumstances beyond \nhis control adversely affected his finances including divorce, failure of his former spouse \nto make payments on some debts, and concern about whether he was responsible for \nchild support for one child. However, he did not show that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, \ndue to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether \nApplicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial \ndifficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. \n1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. Applicant did not provide documentary evidence that he \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment entered against Applicant in August 2018 for $13,849. \nThis debt resulted from repossession of a vehicle. He made $150 monthly payments, and \nhe will be making $150 monthly payments until August 2024. According to his April 2, \n2020 credit report, the current balance is $11,128. His April 2, 2020 credit report shows \nhis resolution of his SOR \u00b6 1.e child support debt for $864. He is credited with mitigating \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. He has reduced his delinquent child support debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c from \n$5,266 to $4,758; however, he has not mitigated this debt because he did not establish a \ngood reason for the delinquency. The prudent, responsible approach would have been to \nset aside funds in the event the DNA test showed Applicant was the parent of his third \nchild, or to expedite the DNA test or both. He did not prove he acted prudently and \nresponsibly in regard to his child support responsibilities because he did not prove he was \nunable to more rapidly reduce his child-support arrearage.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts may have been either charged off or \ndropped from his credit report or both. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit \nreport is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The \nFair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit \nreport seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection \nbarred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act \nUpdates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-\nreporting-act.pdf. Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors \nbelieve the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit \nreporting company\u2019s request for information or when the debt has been charged off.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007) (internal citation omitted) \n(mitigating security concerns despite garnishment to pay debt because of other financial \nefforts), the Appeal Board explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [this mitigating condition] an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s \ndebts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d However, the \nBoard has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a showing that \na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more \nthat show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or the statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of \n[these mitigating conditions]. \n \nApplicant did not provide a personal financial statement or budget. He did not \nprove that he was unable to address or make greater progress on his eight unmitigated \nSOR debts. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation relating to eight SOR debts \nsuch as: (1) proof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies \nof checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the \ncreditor; (2) correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; \n(3) copies of credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies \nindicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a \nbelief; (4) evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers \nor agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of \nprogress or resolution.  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to \nmake greater documented progress resolving any of the eight debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.d and 1.f through 1.j totaling $18,004. There is insufficient assurance that his \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nfinancial problems are being resolved. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish \nmitigation of financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, and he has been employed as a truck driver since August \n2007. There is no evidence of workplace misconduct, abuse of alcohol, use of illegal \ndrugs, or criminal conduct. He did not provide copies of performance evaluations or \ncharacter references.  \n \nApplicant provided important mitigating information. His finances were harmed by \nseveral circumstances beyond his control. He has an established $150 monthly payment \nplan addressing the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and he brought his child support account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e to current status. He mitigated the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e.      \n \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial. Applicant \ndid not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater documented \nprogress resolving eight delinquent SOR debts totaling $18,004. There is no evidence of \nprogress (payments or payment plans) in the last two years on seven delinquent SOR \ndebts, and he did not show good faith in his handling of his child support responsibilities \nfor his youngest child. His lack of responsible financial action raises unmitigated questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSee AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to \nmitigate financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On February 3, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec.

He has never been married, and he has no children. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86, dated June 19, 2019); GE 2 (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated July 9, 2020); GE 3 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 25, 2019); \nand Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated November 11, 2019). \nIn his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having two delinquent accounts that he \nattributed to his unemployment. He contended that he was making monthly payments to \none creditor, and that he would reach out to the other creditor to seek an \u201camicable \nsolution to catch up on payments.\u201d (GE 1, at 33-35) \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $29,454, set \nforth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to an automobile loan opened in December 2015 that became \ndelinquent in June 2018, and $21,944 was charged off. The account was closed by the \ncreditor. (GE 3, at 1; Tr. at 35-36) In October 2018, with funds derived from an inheritance, \nApplicant made a $3,240 payment to the creditor. (AE E; Tr. at 36-37) That was the most \nrecent payment made by him, and the current unpaid balance is approximately $19,053. \n(GE 2, at 2; Tr. at 40) In June 2019, he declared that he would reach out to the creditor \nto reach the \u201camicable solution.\u201d (GE 1, at 35) In March 2020, he indicated that he hoped \nto be able to resolve the account within the next three years. (Answer to the SOR, at 4) \nHowever, he was contacted by a collection agent in April 2020, and he agreed to make a \n$500 payment in May 2020. (AE B) That payment was never made. (Tr. at 41) Despite \nthe fact that the account was closed, Applicant has retained the vehicle, and currently \nuses it. (Tr. at 35, 38) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a credit-card account opened in April 2015 that became \ndelinquent in September 2017, and approximately $10,393 was charged off. (GE 1, at 34; \nGE 2, at 2) In May 2019, a Garnishment Summons was issued in the amount of $10,524, \nand another such summons was issued in January 2020 in the amount of $5,567. (AE A) \nIn June 2019, Applicant claimed to be making $500 per paycheck. (GE 1, at 34) In March \n2020, he stated that the account would be paid in full by the end of July 2020. (Answer to \nthe SOR, at 5) He submitted some documentation supporting eight payments, totaling \napproximately $3,637 made on July 15, 2020, but he denied that he had made payments \nin the amounts reported. (AE C; GE 5; Tr. at 45) As of a week before the August hearing, \nthe remaining unpaid balance was $1,718. (AE G) He claimed that he attempted to call \nthe collection agent, but has been unsuccessful. He has not written the creditor or the \ncollection agent. (Tr. at 48) The account was seemingly in the process of being resolved, \nbut Applicant has failed to furnish documentation reflecting his actual undisputed \npayments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a jewelry store charge account opened in August 2016 with a \n$7,000 credit limit that became delinquent with a past due balance of $358 in September \n2018, and was eventually sold to a credit purchaser of delinquent debt. (GE 2, at 2; GE \n3, at 2) In March 2020, Applicant stated he would pay one-half of the account by March \n13, 2020, with the remainder to be paid by March 27, 2020. (Answer to the SOR, at 6) He \nactually made his first payment, for $180 in September 3, 2020, and a second payment, \nfor $178, on September 8, 2020, both of which took place after the Notice of Hearing was \nalready issued. (AE F) The account has been resolved. \nAfter his period of unemployment ended in September 2018, Applicant\u2019s new \nemployer started him out at $63,000 per year, and by the time he left that employer in \nMay 2020, he was making $70,000 per year. He reported his current annual salary to be \n$92,000. (Tr. at 35) Although Applicant was furnished a blank Personal Financial \nStatement to be completed and submitted by September 2020, he failed to do so. (Tr. at \n67) Therefore, it is not known what his current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income or monthly expenses. He reported a monthly \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nremainder of $1,800 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. He \nestimated that he currently has $3,000 in savings. (Tr. at 51-53) There is no evidence of \na budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional \nfinancial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially than he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $29,454, claiming \nthat because of a period of unemployment, he did not have sufficient funds to maintain \nthem in a current status. When the SOR was issued in February 2020, all three accounts \nwere still delinquent, and Applicant had only made one voluntary payment to one creditor \nin October 2018, and a number of involuntary garnishment payments to another creditor. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has \nbeen unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has \nnot been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). Applicant attributed his financial problems to only one factor: \nunemployment from September 2017 until September 2018. \nOne of the accounts, for $21,944, was charged off in June 2018, and he made only \none $3,240 payment to the creditor in October 2018. Following the charge-off, and since \nthat time, he has made no other payments, despite promising to do so, while continuing \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto use the vehicle for which the loan was opened. Another account for approximately \n$10,393 was also charged off, but despite securing employment in September 2018, he \noffered no evidence of any voluntary payments to the creditor. Instead, in May 2019, a \nGarnishment Summons was issued in the amount of $10,524, and another such \nsummons was issued in January 2020 in the amount of $5,567. Involuntary (garnishment) \npayments were made, but the documentary evidence of the dates and amounts of those \npayments were disputed by Applicant. He finally addressed the third delinquent account, \nthe one for $358, but only did so after the Notice of Hearing had been issued. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously; nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant failed to furnish \nevidence of a reasonable plan and concomitant timely conduct. \nApplicant managed to resolve only one of his three delinquent accounts \u2013 starting \nto do so only after the SOR was issued, and after the Notice of Hearing had been issued. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice \nthat his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-\ndiscipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, \n2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)). \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve them until his wages were garnished (in \none instance), or until the SOR was issued (in another instance), or not at all (in another \ninstance), is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent and \nthey are likely to remain unchanged. Applicant completed his SF 86 in June 2019; \npromised to resolve his delinquent debts within self-created timeframes; the SOR was \nissued in February 2020; and he was subsequently offered the opportunity to submit \ndocumentation regarding his delinquent accounts\u2019 status. Each step of the security \nclearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the financial issues \nconfronting him. \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)). In this instance, Applicant\u2019s repeated promises to make payments were \nnot timely fulfilled. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nIn the absence of substantial positive activity by Applicant, of financial counseling, \nand a budget, it remains difficult to determine if he is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case \nNo. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the \nvarious aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not \nmerely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. \n1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \nacquisition management analyst with his current employer since May 2020. He previously \nworked as a business analyst for another contractor from September 2018 until May \n2020. He was laid off and unemployed from September 2017 until September 2018. A \n2009 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He finally paid off \none of his three creditors. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant had three delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $29,454. His failure to voluntarily and timely resolve them until his wages \nwere garnished in one instance associated with the vehicle for which he stopped making \npayments, while continuing to use it; or until the SOR was issued in another instance \nassociated with a credit card; and not at all until after the Notice of Hearing was issued in \nanother instance related to a jewelry store account, is sufficient to conclude that his \nfinancial difficulties were not infrequent and they are likely to remain unchanged. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best, delaying significant resolution \nefforts, supported by documentation, well after he obtained employment with a reported \nannual salary of $92,000. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations.

His response to the Government\u2019s security concerns did not resolve the \ndoubts raised by his conduct about his judgment and reliability. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 27, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor his employment with a federal contractor. On July 20, 2018, Applicant completed a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) by a government investigator as part of the background \ninvestigation initiated when Applicant submitted his e-QIP. Based on the results of that \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security clearance. \nOn January 23, 2020, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on July 21, 2020, and convened the requested hearing on September \n17, 2020. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 30, 2020. At the \nhearing, Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3, which I admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and presented Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 E, which \nI admitted without objection. Also included in the record are Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1 (Index \nof Government Exhibits), HX 2 (List of Applicant\u2019s Exhibits), and HX 3 (Brief of Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel). At the end of the hearing, I held the record open to give Applicant time to submit \nadditional relevant information. The record closed on October 16, 2020, when I received \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, AX F, and Department Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection \nthereto. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not file his federal \nincome tax returns as required for the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax years (SOR 1.a). \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation and requested a hearing. In \naddition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admission, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old and has been employed by the defense contractor \ncurrently sponsoring his request for clearance since August 2016. After graduating from \ncollege in 2005 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering, he received an officer\u2019s \ncommission in the United States Navy. Between 2005 and 2011, Applicant was stationed \naboard ship and in shore assignments at various locations in the United States. Applicant \nwas raised in State A and lived there until he graduated from college and entered the \nNavy. He maintained State A as his home of record throughout his military career and \nuntil he returned from overseas in 2018. While stationed in State B between 2005 and \n2008, he bought a house in which to live during that assignment. When he left State B for \nhis next assignment, he kept the house as a rental property. Between October 2011 and \nhis honorable discharge from active duty in September 2014, Applicant was stationed in \na foreign country. After leaving active duty, he remained in that country, affiliating with a \nNavy Reserve unit there while studying for a master\u2019s degree in business administration \n(MBA), which he received in June 2017. Applicant remained overseas for his first job with \nhis current employer until August 2018, when he relocated to his current residence in the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnited States. Applicant and his wife were married in November 2016 and have a three-\nyear-old child. (GX 1; Tr. 29 \u2013 34) \nApplicant has held a security clearance since he began his military career in 2005. \nHis eligibility for access was last renewed in 2011. In his most recent clearance \napplication in November 2017, he disclosed that he had not timely filed his federal income \ntaxes for the 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax years. He also stated that in November \n2017, he had filed his 2012, 2013, and 2015 returns, but was still waiting for information \nhe needed to complete his 2014 return. Available information shows that his 2012, 2013, \nand 2014 returns were received by the IRS in March and April 2018. Despite Applicant\u2019s \nclaim that he also submitted his 2015 return in 2017, available information shows that the \nIRS did not receive his 2015 return until January 27, 2020. In his testimony on this issue, \nApplicant reiterated his claim that he filed his 2015 return in 2017, further asserting that \nthere was some confusion in IRS processing of the 2015 return. In advance of his hearing, \nhe resubmitted that return by registered mail on September 6, 2020. Applicant also \ntestified that he filed all state and federal returns as required through the 2011 tax year \nand that he has timely filed his returns for the tax years 2016 through 2020. At hearing, \nApplicant submitted copies of his federal returns for 2012 \u2013 2015; however, those \ndocuments are unsigned and undated products of an electronic filing system. After the \nhearing, Applicant submitted an IRS transcript of Applicant\u2019s 2015 tax filing activity that \nreflects the aforementioned January 2020 filing date. Applicant testified that he has been \nable to file his returns electronically through the IRS website without assistance. (GX 1 \u2013 \n3; AX E; AX F; Tr. 22 \u2013 23, 40 \u2013 43) \nApplicant claims he did not file the returns in question for three reasons. First, while \nliving and working overseas, he had difficulty receiving tax documents pertaining to his \nState B rental property and could not complete his 2012 return. Second, Applicant \nbelieved that because he knew he would be receiving refunds for excess taxes paid in \n2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, and because he was living outside the United States, he did \nnot have to file returns for those years. Finally, Applicant believed that because his home-\nof-record State A no longer taxed military income, he did not have to file a federal return. \nApplicant was mistaken on all three counts. He further has claimed that when he \nsubmitted his November 2017 e-QIP, he realized that he was delinquent in his tax \nreporting obligations and acted to compile and submit his past-due returns. When he \nsubmitted his e-QIP, he also notified his company\u2019s security manager of his tax filing \ndiscrepancies. (GX 1; GX 3; AX C; Tr. 17 \u2013 22) \nAs to his understanding of State A\u2019s tax laws, Applicant testified that State A \nchanged its tax laws regarding military income in 2010. Nonetheless, Applicant filed his \nfederal income tax returns as required for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with his 2012 tax \nreturn, the first return he should have filed after transferring overseas from State B, \nApplicant stated he had difficulty receiving tax documents about his State B rental \nproperty and could not complete his return. He did not indicate when or if he has since \nreceived that information, but at the time he was able to determine based on previous \nyears\u2019 returns that he would receive a refund for the 2012 tax year. Applicant\u2019s only known \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreason for not filing the other returns at issue here was a combination of his beliefs that if \nhe did not owe any taxes (or was due a tax refund), and if State B did not tax military \nincome, and if he was living outside the United States, he did not have to file returns. He \ndid not base those beliefs on any professional tax advice and he has not sought any such \nadvice or assistance in filing his past-due returns despite the fact such assistance was \nreadily available to him, at least while he was on active duty. Applicant also did not explain \nwhy or how the act of submitting his most recent e-QIP caused him to realize his failure \nto file his returns was incorrect. (AX C; Tr. 26 \u2013 27, 34 \u2013 40) \nApplicant owes no unpaid taxes and his personal finances are sound. He recently \nengaged the services of a financial counselor who assisted him in establishing a monthly \nbudget. There is no indication from the available information that Applicant owes unpaid \ntaxes to the IRS or any other tax authority. (AX E; Tr. 27) \nApplicant provided four letters of support for his request for a clearance. Each of \nhis references stated they were familiar with the SOR allegation, but none had any direct \nknowledge of Applicant\u2019s conduct regarding his taxes. Despite the government\u2019s \nconcerns about his failure to file his tax returns, each reference endorsed and supported \nApplicant\u2019s request for clearance. They each cited their experience with Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, professionalism, integrity, and hard work as the reasons they had no concerns \nrecommending Applicant for access to classified information. (AX D) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government presented sufficient reliable information to support the SOR \nallegation that Applicant did not timely file his federal tax returns for the 2012, 2013, 2014, \nand 2015 tax years. This information reasonably raises a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is expressed, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nI also have considered the potential application of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 \nmitigating conditions: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies because all of Applicant\u2019s past-due tax returns at issue have \nbeen filed. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies because Applicant sought financial counseling to improve \nmanagement of his personal finances; however, there is no issue of debt or poor financial \nhealth raised by the Government\u2019s information. \nApplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) is more problematic. Applicant did not fulfill \na fundamental obligation of most U.S. citizens in similar circumstances. Accordingly, the \nfocus of this case is squarely on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. In response to the \nGovernment\u2019s information, his position appears, in part, to be that his failure to file his \nreturns was due to circumstances beyond his control; namely, his belief that that he was \nnot required to file if he expected to receive a refund, and his belief that because State A \ndid not tax military income and because he was living and working overseas, he did not \nhave to file. \nA person may not avoid his or her income tax reporting responsibility simply \nbecause he expects to receive a tax refund. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s confusion about his \ntax reporting obligations was not a circumstance beyond his control. He could easily have \nresolved those concerns at any time by consulting tax preparation resources readily \navailable both in the United States and abroad. His explanation regarding the impact of \nState A tax law changes is also inconsistent with his actions. According to Applicant, \nthose laws changed in 2010, yet he filed his 2010 and 2011 federal returns as required. \nApplicant did not provide a credible explanation about why he then became confused \nabout his filing obligations. Finally, his conduct is not remote in time because he did not \nact to resolve his filing discrepancies until late 2017 or early 2018, between three and five \nyears after they were due. It also may be that his 2015 return was not filed until September \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                     \n \n2015 or January 2020. I conclude from all of the foregoing that the record does not support \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b). \nThe security concerns about raised under AG \u00b6 18 have not been mitigated. I also \nevaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nInformation about Applicant\u2019s character and military service is significant. Nonetheless, \nthe value of the recommendations in this case is limited. While each of his references had \nreviewed the SOR, they were not fully informed of Applicant\u2019s conduct so as to render \nincomplete their opinions of Applicant\u2019s suitability for a position of trust. Having \nconsidered all of the information presented, I conclude that doubts about Appellant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability remain. Because protection of the interest of national security is \nthe principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against \ncontinuation of his access. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is \ndenied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Item 3.) On April 10, 2020, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on April 30, 2020, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2.) In his \nAnswer he admitted all the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. On June 16, \n2020, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. A complete copy \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nof the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 5, was provided to \nApplicant, who received the file on July 24, 2020.  \n \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant submitted additional \nmaterial on August 22, 2020. Department Counsel had no objection, and the \ndocumentation is identified as Applicant Exhibit A and admitted into evidence.  \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 22, 2020. Based upon a review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 66 and married to his second wife. Applicant was employed by the \nDefense Department from 1971 until 2010, when he retired. Since that time he has \nbeen employed by the Defense Department as a contractor. He has held a security \nclearance almost continuously since 1971, and seeks to retain national security \neligibility for access to classified information in connection with his employment. (Item 3 \nat Sections 13A and 25, Item 4.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted both allegations under \nthis paragraph. \n \n \n 1.a. Applicant used marijuana at least ten times from January 1975 to January \n1982. During all that time Applicant held a security clearance. (Item 2, Item 3 at Section \n23, Item 5; Applicant Exhibit A.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant again used marijuana from approximately December 2016 to \nDecember 2019. He smoked marijuana approximately 60 times during that period. \nApplicant held a security clearance for the entire period. (Item 2, Item 3 at Section 23, \nItem 4, Item 5; Applicant Exhibit A.) \n \n \nApplicant self-reported his drug use during an interview with an investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on December 29, 2017. According to the \ninvestigator, \u201cHe [Applicant] decided to answer positively during the interview since he \nregretted not disclosing it on the case papers.\u201d (Item 4.) \n \n \nIn response to a set of interrogatories, Applicant admitted to continuing to use \nmarijuana until December 2019. This means he continued to use marijuana for two \nyears after admitting his use to the OPM investigator. He also admitted to purchasing \nmarijuana (Item 4.) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \nIn his Answer (Item 2), Applicant stated, \u201cI know that I did not have a medical \nprescription for it [marijuana use] and that it was not the right thing to do, but because I \ncould not drink any alcohol, I used marijuana on occasion to help me relax.\u201d \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he has engaged in conduct that shows questionable judgment, lack \nof candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph. \n \n \nApplicant filled out an e-QIP on October 20, 2017. (Item 3.) Section 26 of that \nquestionnaire concerned Applicant\u2019s drug use history. Specifically, Applicant was asked \nif he had used any illegal drugs, including marijuana, within the last seven years. \nApplicant was also asked if he had \u201cEVER\u201d illegally used drugs while holding a security \nclearance. [Emphasis in original.] He answered both of these questions, \u201cNo.\u201d These \nwere false answers to relevant questions concerning his drug abuse history. \n \n \nOther than his own general description, Applicant did not submit any evidence \nconcerning the quality of his job performance. He submitted no character references or \nother evidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was \nunable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to \nhave his case decided without a hearing. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information.  \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of purchasing and using illegal drugs. This occurred \nbetween 1975 and 1982, and again from 2016 and 2019. Applicant held a security \nclearance during both times in question. All three of the stated disqualifying conditions \napply. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant had not used illegal drugs for about eight months when the record \nclosed. Applicant is a smart, capable, and mature individual. He has been working for \nthe Defense Department for many years, has had a security clearance since 1971, and \nhas been investigated to renew his security clearance several times. He knew illegal \ndrug use was wrong, and yet he continued to use marijuana for two years after \nadmitting his drug involvement to an OPM investigator in 2017. Neither of the mitigating \nconditions apply. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe following mitigating condition is arguably applicable under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \n \nApplicant admitted his recent drug use, and his falsification, to an OPM \ninvestigator two months after filling out his e-QIP. I weighed this fact together with \nApplicant\u2019s over forty-year history of holding a Department of Defense security \nclearance, which included filling out at least three prior security clearance \nquestionnaires. He knew the obligation to tell the truth and blatantly ignored it. Under \nthe particular circumstances of this case, his subsequent admission of the falsification is \nnot sufficiently mitigating. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant illegally used marijuana over \n70 times during the almost 50 year period in which he held a security clearance. He \nfalsely denied his drug involvement on his 2017 e-QIP. He understood the wrongfulness \nof his conduct, yet continued to use marijuana for two years after revealing it to the \nOPM investigator. Insufficient time has passed, since his recent misconduct, to \ndemonstrate rehabilitation or reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record \nevidence as described above leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to \nApplicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines \nfor Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Personal Conduct. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n            \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n            \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

When Applicant responded to the allegations, he admitted the use of marijuana, but clarified that most of his marijuana use occurred during his 20s and 30s; that he used marijuana occasionally, perhaps once every six months, during his 40s and 50s; and that he \u201conly started using marijuana in the last few years right before bed to help [him] sleep.\u201d He admitted that he held a security clearance but claimed that he never worked on sensitive information.

He asserts that he stopped using marijuana more than six months ago, but it is \nnot enough to overcome the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal \nconduct security concerns. Clearance eligibility is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn January 31, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing a security concern under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR explained why the DCSA CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DSCA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all adjudications for national security \neligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 19, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) administrative judge. On April 22, 2020, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), including three items consisting of its documentary evidence. \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, and instructed him that any response \nwas due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on May 26, 2020. He \nsubmitted a response dated June 17, 2020, which was received by DOHA on June 22, \n2020, without any objection.  \n \nOn July 7, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on July 10, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 3 to the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on February 20, 2019. The \nsummary report was included in the DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In a footnote to the FORM, \nApplicant\u2019s attention was directed to the following important notice: \n  \nThe attached summary of your Personal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 3) is \nbeing provided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as part of the \nrecord evidence in this case. In your response to this File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM), you can comment on whether the PSI summary accurately \nreflects the information you provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) \nand you may make any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates \nnecessary to make the summary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can \nobject on the ground that the report is unauthenticated by a Government \nwitness and the documents may not be considered as evidence. If no \nobjections are raised in your response to the FORM, or if you do not respond \nto the FORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived \nany objections to the admissibility of the summary and may consider the \nsummary as evidence in your case. \n \n\n3 \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe PSI summary, to comment on it, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to \nthe information in the PSI summary. Applicant did not file any objections in his response to \nthe FORM. In the absence of any comment or objections, it is reasonable to infer that he \ndid not object to consideration of the summary or the other documents relied on by the \nGovernment. Accordingly, items 1-3 are accepted into evidence as Government exhibits \n(GEs). Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR is admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and cross-alleges under Guideline \nE (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about January \n1972 to at least February 2019, including while holding a security clearance. When \nApplicant responded to the allegations, he admitted the use of marijuana, but clarified that \nmost of his marijuana use occurred during his 20s and 30s; that he used marijuana \noccasionally, perhaps once every six months, during his 40s and 50s; and that he \u201conly \nstarted using marijuana in the last few years right before bed to help [him] sleep.\u201d He \nadmitted that he held a security clearance but claimed that he never worked on sensitive \ninformation. He asserted that he stopped using marijuana with no intention of future use \nand is willing to undergo drug testing to prove his abstention. Applicant denied the personal \nconduct security concerns, indicating that he did not attempt to conceal his marijuana use \nin any way and that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. (GE 1.) \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR \nallegations (GE 1), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old information technology specialist, who has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since August 2018. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin June 1995 and a master\u2019s degree in June 2002. He has been married to his current wife \nsince May 1993, and they have a son age 25 and a daughter age 22. Applicant also has a \n42-year-old son from his first marriage and a 30-year-old daughter from another \nrelationship that did not result in marriage. As of December 2018, Applicant and his current \nspouse\u2019s two children were still living at home. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant worked as an information technology specialist for a large defense \ncontractor from January 1974 to April 2014. He held a DOD security clearance at the \nsecret level from about January 1976 while in that job. (GE 2.) Applicant, who had begun \nusing marijuana in January 1972, continued to use the drug at a frequency not specifically \ndelineated in the evidentiary record other than that most of his marijuana use occurred \nduring his 20s and 30s. He naively believed that marijuana was harmless and did not affect \nanyone else. (GEs 2-3; AE A.) Applicant asserts that the sensitive work for which he held a \nsecurity clearance \u201cnever materialized.\u201d (GE 1.) During his 40s and 50s (from about late \n\n4 \n \n1993 through 2013), Applicant asserts that he used marijuana occasionally, \u201cmaybe once \nevery 6 months,\u201d at times with a friend. (GE 3; AE A.) \n \nWhen medical marijuana became available in his state, Applicant \u201cdeemed it \nacceptable to use [marijuana] to relax before sleep,\u201d and he began using marijuana on \noccasion for that purpose. (AE A.) A review of pertinent state law shows that medical \nmarijuana use was decriminalized in 1996. See California\u2019s Health and Safety Code \u00a7 \n11362.5. With the passage of Proposition 64 at the November 8, 2016 statewide general \nelection, adults age 21 and over could legally consume and possess up to one ounce (28.5 \ngrams) of marijuana for recreational purposes. See California\u2019s Civil Code \u00a7 1550.5. \nApplicant did not provide a specific date for when he began using marijuana as a sleep aid. \nHe indicated in response to the SOR that he \u201conly started using marijuana in the last few \nyears right before bed to help [him] sleep.\u201d There is no evidence that he ever held a \nmedical marijuana card.  \n \nApplicant worked as an information technology manager for a satellite television \ncompany from September 2014 to March 2016; was unemployed from March 2016 to \nFebruary 2017; and worked as a systems and programming manager for a candy \nmanufacturer from February 2017 to February 2018, when he was fired for work-related \nissues. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant asserts, albeit without corroboration, that he had stopped using marijuana \nafter he left his job of 40 years in 2014, but resumed his occasional use after he was hired \nby his current employer in August 2018. During the job application process, Applicant was \ninformed that he would need a security clearance for the position and asked whether that \nwould be a problem for him. Applicant asked his future managers what type of behavior \ncould pose a problem and was given no guidance. His employer did not require that he \ntake a drug test, which he thought was \u201cvery odd\u201d since drug tests were required for other \njobs that did not require a security clearance. He \u201cwrongly thought that marijuana usage \nwas not a concern, and felt comfortable with resuming [his] occasional marijuana use.\u201d  \n(AE A.)  \n \nOn December 6, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant disclosed on his SF 86 \nthat he had used marijuana in the last seven years; that he first used it in approximately \nJanuary 1972 and most recently in November 2018. As to the nature, frequency, and \nextent of his marijuana use, Applicant stated, \u201cI use it socially and as a sleep aid. I used it \non and off and most recently 2 or 3 times a week.\u201d Applicant responded affirmatively to \nwhether he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. He answered \u201cYes\u201d to \nwhether he intends to use the drug in the future and explained, \u201cA proper night\u2019s sleep is \nvery important to [his] health.\u201d (GE 2.) \n \n On February 20, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant explained that he was currently \nusing marijuana by pipe a couple of times per week on average to help him sleep and that \nhe purchases marijuana legally from a dispensary, spending less than $100 per quarter for \n\n5 \n \nthe drug. He added that since the 1970s, he has used marijuana once every couple \nmonths to every few months socially with a friend. Applicant denied any use of marijuana \nbefore work or during the daytime, any dependency on the drug, and ever testing positive \nfor the drug. Applicant expressed his intention to continue to use marijuana, but also his \nwillingness to stop \u201cif asked by federal law in order to maintain a security clearance.\u201d He \nindicated that he would resume using marijuana after he retires. (GE 3.) \n \nOn January 31, 2020, the DCSA issued an SOR to Applicant because of his history \nof marijuana use, including while holding a security clearance. Applicant explained in \nresponse that most of his marijuana use occurred some 35 to 45 years ago and was \u201cat \nbest occasional (maybe once every 6 months) in [his] 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s; that he only started \nusing marijuana in the last few years before bed to help him sleep; that while he held a \nclearance many years ago, he never worked on any project that required a clearance; and \nthat he had ceased using marijuana and had no plan to use the drug in the future. He \nindicated that he was using over-the-counter medications to regulate his sleep and \nexpressed willingness to undergo drug testing to prove his abstention. In response to \npersonal conduct security concerns raised by his use of marijuana, Applicant admitted that \nhe knew his marijuana use might cause a problem, but he did not conceal his involvement. \n(GE 1.) \n \nApplicant denies that he was ever a habitual user of marijuana. He asserts that he \nstopped using marijuana more than six months ago and plans not to use marijuana in the \nfuture. (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n6 \n \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant began using marijuana in approximately January 1972, and he continued \nto use the drug with varying frequency while working for a defense contractor for some 40 \nyears and holding a DOD secret clearance granted to him around January 1976. During his \nFebruary 2019 PSI, he did not report a significant period of abstention from drug \ninvolvement. He now asserts that he stopped using marijuana in April 2014 but resumed \nhis marijuana use when he returned to work in the defense industry in August 2018. He \nwas using marijuana two to three times a week as of his December 2018 SF 86 and \nFebruary 2019 PSI. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and possession of \nmarijuana is a federal criminal offense. His drug involvement clearly establishes \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition),\u201d and \u00b6 \n\n7 \n \n25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d warrants some \ndiscussion. Applicant indicated on his December 2018 SF 86 that he intended to continue \nto use marijuana in the future as a sleep aid. As of his February 2019 PSI, he planned to \ncontinue using marijuana, but expressed a willingness to stop \u201cif asked by federal law in \norder to maintain a security clearance.\u201d He asserted in March 2020 that he had stopped \nusing marijuana. In June 2020, he stated that he had not used any marijuana in more than \nsix months and did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Applicant did not explain what \nled to his decision to forego future drug involvement. The SOR may well have been a \nsignificant factor in his decision to cease using marijuana, but I cannot speculate in that \nregard. In any event, his candid disclosures on his SF 86 and during his PSI of his \nmarijuana involvement and intention of future use against self-interest allow me to find \ncredible his change of heart with respect to future marijuana consumption. AG \u00b6 25(g) no \nlonger applies. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia,\u201d Applicant purchased marijuana in recent years from a dispensary and used \nmarijuana in a pipe. His state\u2019s decriminalization of medical marijuana in 1996, and \nlegalization in 2016 of recreational use and possession of up to once ounce of marijuana \nby adults 21 and over, does not alter existing federal laws and regulations prohibiting the \nuse and possession of marijuana. However, Applicant\u2019s possession of marijuana and drug \nparaphernalia (pipe) and his purchases cannot provide separate bases for disqualification \nbecause they were not alleged in the SOR. However, I cannot ignore the circumstances of \nhis marijuana use, including his reliance on marijuana regularly as a sleep aid in 2019, \nwhen evaluating the risk of future drug involvement. \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply, and given \nhis decades of marijuana use, he bears a heavy burden. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation as \nfollows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n\n8 \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility;  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s recreational use of marijuana \nmay well have declined since the 1970s, and been occasional in recent years, but his \nregular use of marijuana as a sleep aid in 2018 and 2019 is too recent and recurrent to \nfavorably consider AG \u00b6 26(a). \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(b), the extent to which security concerns may have been \nattenuated by the passage of time is a question resolved in light of the evidence as a \nwhole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01847 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9. 2015). Applicant has not \nestablished a sufficient period of abstinence when considering his decades of marijuana \nuse and his reliance on the drug as a medication to bring about sleep two or three times a \nweek in 2018 and 2019 while working for a DOD contractor. Moreover, it is unclear whether \nhe continues to associate with the friend with whom he used marijuana socially over the \nyears. During his February 2019 PSI, he indicated that he had used marijuana every \ncouple of months to every few months with the same friend since the 1970s. Marijuana was \na significant part of Applicant\u2019s lifestyle within the past year or so. The drug involvement \nand substance misuse security concerns are not yet mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nConcerning the Government\u2019s case for disqualification under the personal conduct \nguideline because of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use while he held an active security clearance \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a), the Appeal Board has held that security-related conduct can be considered \nunder more than one guideline, and in an appropriate case, be given independent weight \n\n9 \n \nunder each. See ISCR Case No. 13-01281 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2014). Applicant \nexercised \u201cquestionable judgment\u201d within the general security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 15 \nwhen he repeatedly used marijuana while holding a secret clearance. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in approximately January 1976 for his work with a defense contractor, and \nthere is no evidence that his clearance was administratively terminated, suspended, or \nrevoked over the next 38 years of his employment with the company. Applicant had an \nobligation as a clearance holder to comply with the federal law and DOD policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use, whether or not he handled sensitive matters.  \n  \nIt may reasonably be inferred from the limited evidence of record that Applicant \nknew marijuana use was inconsistent with his security clearance and federal drug laws, \neven while he \u201cdeemed it acceptable\u201d to use marijuana as a sleep aid after his state \ndecriminalized medical marijuana use. He indicated during his PSI that he would be willing \nto stop using marijuana \u201cif asked to by federal law in order to maintain a security \nclearance.\u201d Moreover, when he responded to the SOR allegations, he stated in response to \nthe personal conduct concerns \u201cI knew that my marijuana usage may cause a problem.\u201d  \n \nApplicant exhibited some reform under AG \u00b6 17(d) by admitting his marijuana use, \nincluding  in the past while holding a DOD clearance and by resolving not to use any illegal \ndrug in the future. AG \u00b6 17(d) provides: \n  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nHowever, it is difficult to find adequate reform in this case. Applicant has yet to \nexpress remorse for his years of disregard of the federal drug laws and policies prohibiting \nmarijuana possession and use. Applicant either does not understand or is unwilling to \nacknowledge that his obligation to comply with federal restrictions on marijuana possession \nand use did not depend on whether he was given classified work when he had a clearance \nor whether he had to take a pre-employment drug test for his current job. The personal \nconduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \n\n10 \n \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past \ntransgressions, and Applicant\u2019s candor about his drug involvement weighs in his favor. Yet, \nit is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The Government \nmust be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to fulfill their \nresponsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without regard to their \npersonal interests. Applicant\u2019s long history of marijuana use, including for many years while \nholding a secret clearance, raises enough doubt in that regard to where I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant responded to the SOR on an indeterminate date, and \nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on March 25, 2020. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on April 21, 2020. As of \nJune 2, 2020, he had not responded. The case was assigned to me on June 12, 2020. \nThe Government exhibits included in the FORM are admitted in evidence.  \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Applicant admitted \nowing all the debts. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he cosigned with his mother for the $28,464 vehicle loan \nand for her rent, and she did not pay the accounts. He asserted that his mother\u2019s car \nwas stolen and \u201cinsurance didn\u2019t want to pay out.\u201d None of the credit reports in evidence \nlist the debts as joint accounts. The $6,464 vehicle loan resulted from a motorcycle \naccident. Insurance did not pay the full amount of the loan, and Applicant chose not to \npay the deficiency balance because he felt that his credit was already ruined by his \nmother\u2019s failure to pay the auto loan. The medical debt was incurred when he did not \nhave health insurance. (Items 2-6) \n \n \nApplicant indicated during his background interview in March 2019 that he did not \nhave the means to pay the debts at that time, but he planned to consolidate the debts in \nthe following year to pay the debts. He also stated that he will not cosign any more \nloans. He asserted that he was living within his means, that he planned to rebuild his \ncredit, and that he will pay all his future debts. There is no evidence of any payments \ntoward the debts alleged in the SOR. (Items 2-6) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n\n \n3 \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including two charged-off vehicle \nloans, a delinquent medical debt, and unpaid rent. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he cosigned with his mother for the $28,464 vehicle loan \nand for her rent, and she did not pay the accounts. He asserted that his mother\u2019s car \nwas stolen and \u201cinsurance didn\u2019t want to pay out.\u201d None of the credit reports in evidence \nlist the debts as joint accounts. The $6,464 vehicle loan resulted from a motorcycle \naccident. Insurance did not pay the full amount of the loan, and Applicant chose not to \npay the remainder because he felt that his credit was already ruined by his mother\u2019s \nfailure to pay the auto loan. The medical debt was incurred when he did not have health \ninsurance. Some of those conditions were beyond his control. Notwithstanding, the \nevidence is insufficient for the applicability of the above mitigating conditions. \n \n \nApplicant has not made any payments toward the debts alleged in the SOR. He \nasserted he planned to consolidate the debts and pay them. However, intentions to \nresolve debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or \n\n \n5 \n \nother responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2009, and his debts \nwere discharged the same year. He was denied a security clearance in 2015 for failing \nto report his domestic violence charges on a January 2012 security clearance \napplication. He reported his criminal history, the denial of his security clearance, and his \nfinancial problems on a January 2019 security clearance application. He submitted \ndocuments and letters attesting to his excellent work performance and moral character. \n(Tr. at 23, 35, 54; GE 1, 4-6; AE D-H) \nThe SOR as amended alleges four delinquent debts. The debts include a \ncharged-off vehicle loan ($28,572), a charged-off credit card from a home improvement \nstore ($5,623), a collection account to a telecommunications company ($945), and a \ncollection account for a warehouse store credit card ($6,286). \nApplicant worked in the auto industry for a number of years. From about 2014 to \n2018, he was the owner of a part-time business in which he bought and sold \naftermarket parts for cars. In about July 2015, he bought a performance truck for about \n$75,000. He paid about $20,000 as a down payment, and financed the remainder. A \ncredit report shows the high balance on the loan as $50,054. (Tr. at 23, 34-35; GE 1-3, \n6, 7) \nAbout two weeks after he bought it, the truck was in an accident. The frame was \ndamaged, and the car dealer told Applicant that the truck should be totaled. The \ninsurance company wanted to repair the truck. Applicant is not a mechanic, but he has \nextensive mechanical experience, and he did not feel the truck would be safe to drive \nhis family with a repaired frame. Applicant never reclaimed possession of the truck and \nstopped making payments. It is not completely clear, but the truck was apparently \nrepaired and sold at auction. Credit reports show that $24,381 was charged off.

There is no evidence that the finance company has actively pursued collection \nof the debt. (Tr. at 23-27, 35, 39-48, 54, 56-58; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A, I \nApplicant denied owing the three remaining debts. His wife handles most of their \nfinancial matters. She credibly testified that she lost one of her wallets with several \ncredit cards in about 2015. She was an authorized user on some credit cards. They \ncontinued to pay the accounts for a period before she realized what had happened. She \nbelieves the two credit card debts and possibly the telecommunications debt resulted \nfrom the lost wallet. (Tr. at 27-30, 39, 48-53, 56, 58-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 6) \nThe $5,623 charged-off home improvement store credit card debt became \ndelinquent in April 2016. The creditor issued an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) \nin July 2019, which cancelled $4,821 in debt. The income from the cancellation was \naddressed in Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s income tax returns. The most recent credit \nreports show the account with a $0 balance. The September 2020 Equifax credit report \nindicates, \u201cConsumer disputes \u2013 reinvestigation in progress.\u201d (Tr.at 27-28; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE I, J, L) \nThe two remaining debts are reported on the August 2020 TransUnion report that \nwas provided by Applicant and introduced as GE 7. The warehouse store credit card \naccount became delinquent in about August 2015. Applicant and his wife denied ever \nhaving an account with the telecommunications company. The August 2020 TransUnion \ncredit report indicates that it was placed for collection in January 2020. It does not show \nwhen the debt became delinquent, but it indicates that the debt is estimated to be \nremoved in September 2021, which would appear to indicate the debt is about six years \nold. (Tr. at 28, 49-50, 63-64; GE 2, 3, 7) \nApplicant has been disputing debts on his credit report since at least 2016. He \nhas not been successful thus far in having any of the alleged debts deleted. His \nfinances are otherwise stable. He is current on his mortgage loan, child support, and \nincome taxes. He has an auto loan that is almost paid, and he does not have a \nsignificant amount of revolving debt.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s truck was in an accident shortly after he bought it. He got in a dispute \nwith the insurance company over whether the truck should have been a total loss. \nApplicant is not a mechanic, but he has extensive mechanical experience, and he did \nnot feel the truck would be safe to drive his family with a repaired frame. He essentially \nwalked away and let the truck be repossessed. When he did so, he lost the $20,000 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndown payment that he made when he bought the truck about a month before. That was \napparently not enough to cover the deficiency when the truck was sold. \nApplicant\u2019s wife credibly testified that she lost one of her wallets with several \ncredit cards in about 2015. She believes the two credit card debts and possibly the \ntelecommunications debt resulted from the lost wallet. All of the alleged debts became \ndelinquent at least four years ago. Applicant has been disputing debts on his credit \nreport since at least 2016. He has not been successful thus far in having any of the \nalleged debts deleted. His finances are otherwise stable. He is current on his mortgage \nloan, child support, and income taxes. He has an auto loan that is almost paid, and he \ndoes not have a significant amount of revolving debt. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/22/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). His lack of action over the past several years, despite his awareness \nthat his debts were a security issue, does not support a finding of a good-faith effort. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn September 4, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn March 6, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, (Financial Considerations.) The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information; and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines issued by the Director of National Intelligence, effective within the \nDOD on or after June 8, 2017. (GE 1, 2) \n\n2 \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2020. He admitted two of the SOR \nallegations, (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b), and he denied the others, (\u00b6\u00b6 1c., and 1.d) He submitted \ndocuments with his response to the SOR. He requested that his case be decided by an \nadministrative judge on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (GE 1) \nOn April 30, 2029, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six items, \nwas mailed to Applicant on April 30, 2020. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant received the FORM on May 7, \n2020, and he provided a 10-page written explanation in his response to the FORM, and \nhe attached 17 documents. I labeled his documents as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A 1-17, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. He did not object to Items 1 \nthrough 6, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted into \nevidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to \nme on July 6, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nHaving \nthoroughly \nconsidered \nthe \nevidence \nin \nthe \nrecord, \nincluding \nApplicant's admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 67 years old. \nHe earned a master\u2019s degree in 1996. He has been married since 1972 and has two \ngrown children. In 1972, he enlisted into the U.S. Air Force, and he was honorably \ndischarged in 1977. He held a DOD security clearance during his 25-year career as a \nfederal civil service employee. Since September 2018, he has been employed by a \nfederal contractor as a program analyst. (GE 1, 2; AE A) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent accounts totaling approximately $27,000, of \nwhich $15,000 is attributed to delinquent federal taxes. Applicant stated the tax debt \ndeveloped as a result of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax audits of his business \nfor tax years 2008 \u2013 2011. He claimed that all of his federal income taxes are paid \nand current. Applicant retired from civil service, and in 1998, he started his own \nbusiness as a senior management consultant. His business did federal subcontractor \nwork and also partnered with city public schools to provide math and science \neducational support for many underprivileged students. From 2009 to 2014, his \nsmall business struggled financially. He received annual IRS tax audits, for both \npersonal and business tax returns, for tax years 2006 through 2011. The audits \nrevealed several tax issues, and a $15,000 federal tax lien for tax years 2008-2011 \nwas filed against him. In addition, the board of education for the public city schools \nfailed to pay his business $48,000 for services rendered. The city school board\u2019s \nposition was that there was no signed contract on file. His business closed in \nDecember 2015. (GE 1, 2; AE A) \nThe financial allegations are supported by credit reports submitted by the \nGovernment. Applicant did disclose his federal tax issue on the SCA, but he did not \n\n3 \ndisclose any other adverse financial accounts. The credit reports do not show that any \nof the accounts are under dispute. (GE 2, 4-6; AE A) The record establishes the status \nof Applicant\u2019s accounts as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $15,000 federal tax debt that remains unpaid. Applicant \nhired a tax attorney in approximately 2014 to provide the IRS an offer in compromise \n(OIC). He also tried to refinance his home so that he could pay the federal tax debt, but \nhe claimed that he was unable to obtain a new loan after the federal tax lien had been \nfiled. He wanted to make installment payments through the OIC process, but he was \nunable to make any payments within the required five-month time period. He decided \nthat his only option to pay his tax debt was to collect the $48,000 unpaid business \ninvoice pending with the city schools. In April 2016, the IRS determined that his tax debt \nwas uncollectible, and made it clear to Applicant that he remained financially \nresponsible for the federal tax debt. The IRS stated in their letter that it was to his \nadvantage to make voluntary payments towards the amounts he owed to minimize \nadditional interest and penalties. In at least 2016, e-mail communications disclosed that \nthe IRS had garnished his retirement income. Applicant contacted his attorney in an \neffort to stop the garnishment. In his SOR response, the March 2020 documentation \nshowed that the IRS garnished his retirement income from the Office of Personnel \nManagement to pay towards his delinquent federal taxes since he did not submit \npayments to the IRS voluntarily. (GE 1; AE A, A-3, A-6, A-7, A-8, A-13, A-14, A-15, A-\n16) \nApplicant\u2019s documents show that his OIC of $32,395 was accepted by the IRS, \nand he was required to put down 20%, or pay $6,279 by December 2014. The \nremaining 80% balance of $26,348 was due within five months. There is no explanation \nfrom him about this significantly higher federal tax amount that was included in the OIC. \nAccording to his tax attorney, Applicant owed the IRS approximately $75,327 for both \npersonal and business delinquent federal taxes. The OIC amount was about 43% of the \ntotal tax obligation. This adverse information is not alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s tax \nattorney reported that the IRS was fully aware that his home was almost fully paid, and \nthe equity in his home could pay the majority, if not all, of his OIC. Although Applicant \nclaimed he could not refinance his home mortgage with the credit union creditor set \nforth below, it was his attorney\u2019s opinion that Applicant was just \u201cunwilling\u201d to do so. It is \nclear from the e-mail communications that Applicant was not pleased with the OIC. (GE \n1; AE A-6) In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered \nstating:  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to\nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;\n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines\nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under\nDirective Section 6.3.\n\n4 \nIn his SOR response, Applicant stated; \u201cI have agreed and made arrangements \nwith the U.S Department of Treasury to pay the amount owed, and I am in compliance \nwith those arrangements. Please see attached letter from the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, dated 03/02/20.\u201d (Emphasis added) The \nattached letter was the garnishment documentation of his retirement income, which is \nnot considered a voluntary payment. There is no evidence of any voluntary payment \narrangement with the IRS. (GE 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off credit union account for $9,985. Applicant admitted \nthis debt is business-related and stated in his SOR response that the credit union is also \nthe holder of his home mortgage. He claimed the credit union was using his home \nequity to resolve this business-related debt, but he did not provide any supporting \ndocumentation. In the 10-page statement he provided after the Government submitted \ntheir File of Relevant Material (FORM), he does not mention that this debt was paid \nfrom the equity in his house. He made it clear in his statement that the debt is linked to \nthe failed business, and not to him personally. There is insufficient evidence to show \nthat this debt is resolved or being paid voluntarily. (GE 1; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a consumer credit account referred for collection in the \namount of $1,262. Applicant denied this allegation in his SOR response. In his \nbackground interview conducted in February 2019, he stated that this was a business \naccount which was not paid due to the outstanding invoice of $48,000 from the city \nschools. However, in his March 2020 SOR response, he stated that this account was \nthe result of a security breach, and he was currently disputing this account. In the 10-\npage statement he provided after the Government submitted the FORM, Applicant \nclaimed that this account stemmed from a lawsuit filed against him in 2006, which was \nsubsequently dismissed. He claimed that his lawyer told him that it is not uncommon for \na creditor to wait ten years and then make another attempt to collect the debt. He \nbelieved this debt is the result of the creditor pulling old debt from old files. This debt is \nnot resolved. (GE 1, 3; AE A, A-16) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a judgment filed against Applicant in 2018 by a collection \nagency for $998. Applicant denied this allegation in his SOR response. In his February \n2019 background interview, he stated that this account was a business debt that was \nnot paid due to the outstanding invoice of $48,000 from the city schools. His March \n2020 SOR response stated that this account was the result of a security breach, and he \nwas currently disputing the account. In the 10-page statement he provided after receipt \nof the Government\u2019s brief and supporting documentation, Applicant claimed that this \ncollection agency has a poor reputation of making false claims. He did not know why the \ncredit reports did not reflect his dispute, but he planned to file another dispute with the \ncredit reporting agencies. This debt is not resolved.   \nApplicant credits his business and himself for enabling several young individuals \nin the city schools, who were not successful in school and life, to become highly \nrecognized professionals over the years. He has many fond memories of teaching, \nmentoring, and coaching underprivileged students with bright young minds. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has over $27,000 of delinquent debt, to include federal taxes that are \nunpaid and unresolved, as shown on his credit reports. In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to apply any of the mitigating conditions. Although \nhis unsuccessful business was a situation beyond his control that adversely affected his \nfinances, Applicant failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He denied two of the four delinquent accounts, (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.d), and he \nprovided inconsistent information about these disputed accounts. He has not shown a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts, or provide proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute. He did not provide documentation of his \ncommunication with the collection creditor to determine whether a listed account on the \ncredit report was in fact fraudulent.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for the other two debts, (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b), but he \nfailed to provide any evidence to show that he is paying, resolving, or has settled any of \nthose debts, to include any voluntary payments as suggested by the IRS. He had an \nopportunity to resolve his delinquent federal taxes with the OIC, however, he failed to \ntake responsible action to resolve this debt. Garnishment of his retirement income is not \nan agreed-upon payment arrangement and does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to \npay this significant tax debt. There is no evidence he received financial counseling, and \nhe did not provide a monthly budget to illuminate why he was unable to make any \n\n \n8 \n \n \nvoluntary payments to his creditors. Overall, Applicant has not paid any of the \ndelinquent debts or made any plans to pay them. His financial situation is not under \ncontrol. Moreover, his lack of action over the past several years, despite his awareness \nthat his debts were a security issue, does not support a finding of a good-faith effort.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a position of trust with the Government. An applicant is \nnot required to be debt-free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide supporting documentation to mitigate his delinquent \naccounts and he failed to demonstrate that he acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances in dealing with his creditors. There is no showing by Applicant of any \neffort to pay, legitimately dispute, or otherwise resolve any of the financial security \nconcerns. Applicant has not provided a financial plan or a detailed budget of his current \nfinancial circumstances. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment, reliability as well as eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Because \n\n \n9 \n \n \nprotection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any \nunresolved doubts must be resolved against the granting of eligibility to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n            \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old shop foreman who has worked in the same position since March 2018. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2008. Applicant was married from 2007-2011. He is now either married to, or cohabitating with, a different woman. (compare SOR Response at 3 and FORM Items 3-4) He has a 26-year-old child. From November 2017 to March 2018, Applicant was without a job when his employer had no work to assign. During this time, he collected unemployment compensation. Around December 2013, he closed his own business after about 18 months, and was unemployed until April 2014. During this time, he was financially reliant on his personal savings. Applicant\u2019s income was limited from March 2011 to April 2012, as he drew unemployment compensation after an employer let him go because there was no work for him. At that time, Applicant began the business which would ultimately be shuttered in December 2013, noted above. At issue in the February 2020 SOR are three allegations concerning three delinquent debts. Applicant admits all allegations: 1.a - STUDENT LOAN \u2013 Collection account (approximately $19,567) 1.b \u2013 MEDICAL DEBT \u2013 Collection account (approximately $315) 1.c \u2013 STUDENT LOAN \u2013 Collection account (approximately $15,246) With regard to 1.b, Applicant wrote in his March 2020 SOR Response that he would address the debt \u201cimmediately.\u201d No documentation of any efforts or success in addressing this obligation was submitted.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nIn a response notarized on March 12, 2020, Applicant answered the three \nallegations raised in the SOR and requested a decision by a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge based on the written record. The \nGovernment\u2019s written brief with six supporting documents (Items 1-6), known as the \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), was submitted by Department Counsel on April 22, \n2020. A complete copy of the FORM was mailed to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on May 5, 2020, but offered no \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nresponse. I was assigned the case on August 21, 2020. Based on the record before \nme, I find Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old shop foreman who has worked in the same position \nsince March 2018. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2008. Applicant was married \nfrom 2007-2011. He is now either married to, or cohabitating with, a different woman. \n(compare SOR Response at 3 and FORM Items 3-4) He has a 26-year-old child.  \n \n \nFrom November 2017 to March 2018, Applicant was without a job when his \nemployer had no work to assign. During this time, he collected unemployment \ncompensation. Around December 2013, he closed his own business after about 18 \nmonths, and was unemployed until April 2014. During this time, he was financially \nreliant on his personal savings. Applicant\u2019s income was limited from March 2011 to April \n2012, as he drew unemployment compensation after an employer let him go because \nthere was no work for him. At that time, Applicant began the business which would \nultimately be shuttered in December 2013, noted above. \n \n \nAt issue in the February 2020 SOR are three allegations concerning three \ndelinquent debts. Applicant admits all allegations: \n \n \n1.a - STUDENT LOAN \u2013 Collection account (approximately $19,567)  \n \n1.b \u2013 MEDICAL DEBT \u2013 Collection account (approximately $315) \n \n1.c \u2013 STUDENT LOAN \u2013 Collection account (approximately $15,246) \n \nWith regard to 1.b, Applicant wrote in his March 2020 SOR Response that he \nwould address the debt \u201cimmediately.\u201d No documentation of any efforts or success in \naddressing this obligation was submitted. As for 1.a and 1.c, Applicant wrote that he \nhad requested forbearance on the student loans and noted that the balances previously \nowed were financially unwieldy. He reported that the student loans were put into \nforbearance, but Applicant \u201cforgot to contact the lender and resume payments. . . . \n(Today, they) continue in late status.\u201d (SOR Response at 3)  \n \nWhen interviewed between December 2018 and January 2019, Applicant \nconveyed that \u201che was confident that he will not experience financial difficulties in the \nfuture.\u201d (FORM, Item 4, at 3) No documentation was offered reflecting his current \nfinancial condition or showing he has received financial counseling. He attributed the \ndelinquency of the debts to his status as a single father who \u201ccouldn\u2019t make ends meet.\u201d  \n \nApplicant wrote that he no longer knows what entity owns the student loans or \nhow to address them. Those accounts are shown as having credit report assignment \ndates in 2011; the medical debt at 1.b has a date of last activity in 2016. (FORM, Item 5, \nat 2) They are all shown as closed accounts in collection. At the end of his SOR \nResponse, Applicant noted: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nI have no intention to deny my responsibility. I currently support my wife \nand a household, 2 cars, and the day to day expenses of life. I consider \nmyself to be a hardworking, tax paying, responsible citizen and do not feel \nthis delinquency should represent my ability to be a responsible adult.  \n \nApplicant only offered generalities regarding his current expenses and needs.  \nHis present income and holdings are not defined. None of his submissions reflect that \nhe has contacted his creditors. No strategy for addressing the debts was detailed.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence showing, and Applicant \nadmitted, the existence of three delinquent debts, thus raising disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts, and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nUnder these facts, three conditions could mitigate related security concerns:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-\nprofit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or under control; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant experienced periods of unemployment due to lack of work from \nNovember 2017 to March 2018, and from March 2011 to April 2012 for the same \nreason. He received unemployment compensation income during these periods, which \nwere the result of circumstances beyond his control. An intervening period of \nunemployment from December 2013 to April 2014 came about when he closed his own \nbusiness, although it is unclear whether this was the result of a business downturn or \nsomething beyond his control. Regardless, a condition tending to mitigate the creation \nof delinquent debt between March 2011 and March 2018 was existent: AG \u00b6 20(b).   \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. There is no \ndocumentation substantiating any of his purported efforts to get his finances under \ncontrol, or reflecting that he has devised and adhered to a good-faith plan to resolve his \nfinancial obligations.  Consequently, mitigation may exist regarding the creation of the \ndelinquent debts at issue, but not regarding his efforts to address them.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nThe 50-year-old Applicant is the head of the household he shares with his \npartner. It is unclear if his 26-year-old son or any other individuals live with the couple. \nDetails regarding his present income, savings, finances, and routine obligations are not \nwell-defined. While Applicant provided facts regarding periods of unemployment tending \nto help mitigate the creation of his delinquent debts, insufficient information and \ndocumentation was provided to mitigate his failure to devise a workable plan for \naddressing his obligations or for mitigating their continued existence. Indeed, a medical \ndebt for slightly over $300 remains unaddressed, and Applicant provided no \ndocumentation regarding his efforts toward working with his lenders or otherwise \nresolving a combined delinquent student loan debt balance of nearly $35,000. \n \nIt is clear that Applicant genuinely wants to honor his delinquent debts. Based on \nthe scant information offered, therefore, it can only be assumed he does not have the \nability to proceed further financially. This process does not require that an applicant \nsatisfy all his delinquent debts. It does, however, expect an applicant to set forth a \nworkable and reasonable plan for effectively and demonstrably addressing them. \nApplicant has thus far failed to present sufficient documentation to meet that standard.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n                       \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \nArthur E.

On July 23, 2019, Applicant provided an interview (PSI, Item 3) to an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Department of \nDefense (DOD) could not make the necessary affirmative findings to grant or continue \nApplicant's eligibility for a clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on \nFebruary 3, 2020.

He has been steadily employed in the military or in commercial jobs \nsince 2008. (Item 2 at 14-23) \nSOR 1.a \u2013 This is a delinquent credit card account ($19,640) that was opened in \nJune 2013. Applicant claimed that he was paying $100 on the account every month, \nincluding May 2019, but missed a payment in June 2019. He also declared that the \naccount was still active, however the program for this credit card was no longer accepted. \nNo additional information was provided. Credit bureau records show that the last payment \nactivity on the account was in May 2018. Though Applicant did not mention this account \nin Item 2 (July 2019 e-QIP), he explained in Item 3 (July 2019 PSI) that he used the credit \ncard for his motorcycle and accessories. According to the bankruptcy records there were \ntwo motorcycles. When he filed his Chapter 13 petition in February 2020, he noted that \nhe surrendered the motorcycle identified in SOR 1.a. (Item 3 at 4; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at \n2; Item 6 at 2; Item 9, Schedule A/B property at 2) The account listed in the petition, but \nis unresolved. \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This is a landlord-tenant lease ($5,008) that Applicant breached \nbetween April and August 2014. He explained that his wife was pregnant when they \nmoved into the apartment and she was allergic to the marijuana fumes they both regularly \nsmelled within the apartment building. Applicant indicated he complained to the landlord \nseveral times, but no action was taken. He discovered a state law which indicated that if \nthe premises contained a safety hazard, the tenant could vacate the dwelling if the \nlandlord did not fix the hazard within 30 days. In July 2019, Applicant was receiving \nassistance to dispute the debt. However, if it was determined that he owed the rental debt \nhe would pay it. Though the delinquent rental account and the other two accounts are \nlisted in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 petition, there is no evidence indicating that payments \nhave been made under the bankruptcy petition. \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This delinquent account ($1,123) is a lease that was opened in March \n2015; the last payment activity on the account was September 2015. In his July 2019 PSI, \nApplicant disavowed any knowledge of the lease. However, the lease appears in \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 petition. (Item 3 at 4; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 6; Item 9 \nat 9) \nApplicant provided no evidence that he has had financial counseling before his \nrecent bankruptcy-related credit counseling in early 2020. He has never been in a debt \nconsolidation program. He did not explain his financial practices and whether he utilizes \na budget to monitor his finances. Applicant stressed that his current financial status was \ngood and he was able to meet his debts on time. (Item 3 at 5) \nIn the Chapter 13 petition which Applicant filed in February 2020, he posted \n$74,242 in assets and $82,273 in liabilities.

There is no information in the record indicating that he remainder \nwas used to pay off the delinquent debts. (Item 10 at 2) \nCharacter Evidence  \n \nIn an undated and unsigned character reference, Applicant\u2019s technical sergeant \nexplained that she has known Applicant for three years. She considered him to be a team \nplayer who is able to complete his military and civilian job responsibilities in an exemplary \nmanner. Without mentioning what his problems are, she was confident that he would be \nable to fix his predicaments to keep his security clearance. \nOn August 2, 2019, Applicant\u2019s coworker extolled Applicant\u2019s ingenuity for \nmodernizing paint schemes to outsmart the competition. The coworker praised \nApplicant\u2019s hard-work and team player attitude.  \nPolicies   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nAG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis   \nFinancial Considerations   \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and \nthus can be a possible indicator of, other public trust issues such as \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol \nabuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at \ngreater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a trustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from \ncriminal activity, including espionage. \nIf a person who seeks a public trust position does not manage her finances in a \nresponsible manner, then there is a probability they may adopt the same kind of \nirresponsible attitude toward safeguarding classified information. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying conditions relevant in this case are: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has three delinquent debts totaling $25,771. The \ndebts began becoming delinquent in 2013 when Applicant opened and used a credit card \nto purchase a motorcycle and accessories (SOR 1.a). The delinquent debts increased in \n2014 (SOR 1.b) and 2015 (SOR 1.c) when Applicant violated apartment leases. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe Government credit bureau reports, bankruptcy records, Applicant\u2019s July 2019 \nPSI, and Applicant\u2019s March 2020 answer to the SOR, establish the Government\u2019s case \nunder the financial considerations guideline. It is well-settled that negative information \nwithin credit bureau reports can establish allegations of debt delinquencies. Applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion of producing evidence that rebuts or mitigates the \nGovernment\u2019s case and meets his burden of demonstrating he deserves to a security \nclearance. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nWhile Applicant filed a Chapter 13 petition in February 2020, there is no evidence \nshowing that Applicant has made any payments under the petition. It is likely that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems will persist in the future. AG 20(a) provides no mitigation. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) recognizes that an applicant\u2019s financial problems may be caused by \nconditions beyond his control. The condition also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has provided no information to \ndemonstrate that the delinquent debts were caused by matters outside his control. He \nmay argue that his underemployment was beyond his control. However, this reason really \nindicates that he has not been managing his finances in a responsible manner. \nPurchasing at least one motorcycle and accessories in lieu of using that money to pay \nfamily necessities, is an example of financial mismanagement. Waiting until after he \nreceived the SOR in early February 2020 to file his Chapter 13 petition is not acting \nreasonably and responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is unavailable for mitigation. While Applicant has received credit \ncounseling, there is nothing to show that he benefited from the counseling to avoid a \nrecurrence of financial problems in the future. The filing of a Chapter 13 petition does not \ndoes no establish that Applicant\u2019s financial debts are being under resolved or under \ncontrol. \nApplicant is entitled to no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because there is no evidence \nthat he made any payments on the three debts since May 2018. Although Applicant\u2019s \nfiling of the Chapter 13 petition in February 2020 represents a legitimate course of action \nin handling unpaid debts, it does not replace a good-faith track record of payments of \npast-due financial obligations. Applicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e) because \nhis dispute of SOR 1.a and 1.b is unsupported by documentary proof identifying the basis \nof the dispute or resolution. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n6 \n\n    \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n___________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nAt the time of issuance of the SOR in February 2020, Applicant owed $25,771. \nGiven the long period of inaction in addressing his indebtedness, it is reasonable to infer \nthat Applicant\u2019s motive for filing the Chapter 13 petition later in February 2020 was his \nanxiety over potentially losing his security clearance rather than a good-faith effort to \ntackle his delinquent debts. Having balanced all the disqualifying evidence against the \nfavorable character endorsements, Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations guideline. \nFormal Findings  \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST \nAPPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion   \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility to a public trust position. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nPaul J.

Applicant\u2019s negligible \nevidence in mitigation falls far short of overcoming the security concerns raised by the \nguideline for financial considerations.

His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since March 2019. He is currently a trainee, awaiting a decision on \nhis application for a security clearance. (Tr. 20.) He graduated from high school in June \n1991. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1991 to March 1997, and in \nthe Army National Guard from March 1997 to August 1998. He received honorable \ndischarges for both periods of service. \nApplicant held several non-federal jobs, many of them entry-level or minimum \nwage, from August 2004 to January 2010, July 2011 to November 2018, and from January \nto March 2019. He was unemployed from January 2020 to July 2011 and November 2018 \nto January 2019. His SCA reflects that he has never held a security clearance. (GX 1 at \n31.) \nApplicant married in February 1994 and divorced in February 2001. He has two \nchildren, ages 26 and 22. He was required to pay child support of $600 per month starting \naround 1998 or 1999 and ending in 2018. (Tr. 29, 46-47.) \nApplicant\u2019s SCA reflects that he has no college credits. However, he testified that \nhe attended college for about three years, and his credit reports reflect multiple student \nloans opened in December 2006. (Tr. 26, 56; GX 2 at 2-3; GX 3 at 203.) He dropped out \nof college so that he could work full time and pay his child support and living expenses. \n(Tr. 56-57.) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from May 2019 \nand December 2019. (GX 2 and 3.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card account placed for collection of $394, reflected in GX \n3 at 4. When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2019, he told \nthe investigator that he did not recognize this debt. (GX 4 at 1.) In his answer to the SOR, \nhe admitted it, but it appears that he thought it was another credit-card account that was \nnot alleged in the SOR. At the hearing, he testified that his only credit-card account is \ncurrent and has never been delinquent. (Tr. 31.) The credit report from May 2019 reflects \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntwo credit cards with the same generic name but issued by different banks. The first credit-\ncard account is listed as current; the second is listed as referred for collection in April \n2019. (GX 3 at 2, 4.) The second account is alleged in the SOR. The credit report from \nDecember 2019 reflects the first account as current, does not list the second account, \nand reflects that Applicant has no debts in collection status. (GX 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: cellphone account placed for collection of $1,491, reflected in GX \n3 at 5. Applicant admitted that he had an account with this cellphone provider and that he \nfell behind on his payments. The credit reports reflect that the debt became delinquent in \nJune 2013 and was referred for collection in August 2016. (GX 2 at 1; GX 3 at 5.) When \nhe was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2019, he said that he did not \nrecognize the debt. (GX 4 at 1.) He testified that he had never been contacted by the \ncreditor or a collection agency. (Tr. 32.) After the hearing, Applicant submitted evidence \nthat he paid the collection agency $497 on September 9, 2020, to settle this debt. (AX B.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d: delinquent student loans, one placed for collection of \n$45,640 and the other 180 days past due for about $9,436. (GX 3 at 2, 4, and 5.) \nApplicant testified that he believes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is included in the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 35-36.) His belief is supported by the May 2019 credit report \nand the December 2019 credit report, both of which reflect a zero balance for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and recite that the loan was assigned to the government. (GX 2 at \n2-3; GX 3 at 4.) When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2019, \nhe stated that he fell behind on his student loan payments in 1997, during his divorce \nproceedings, and he began making payments of $60 per week in July 2002. (GX 4 at 1.) \nHe submitted no documentary evidence of payments. He testified that his tax refunds \nhave been diverted to pay these debts and his pay has been garnished. He was not sure \nabout the amount of the garnishment. (Tr. 37.) He testified that he has not approached \nthe lenders about a payment plan because he will not have a job if his application for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. (Tr. 39-40.) After the hearing, he submitted evidence that he \nhad applied for a federal direct consolidation loan on September 9, 2020. (AX A.) \nApplicant\u2019s current take-home pay is about $2,400 per month. (Tr. 41.) His net \nmonthly remainder after paying all living expenses is between $800 and $900 per month. \n(Tr. 44.) He has accumulated about $3,000 in his checking account. He does not have a \nsavings account or any investments. (Tr. 45.) He paid off the loan for his 15-year-old car \nin 2017. (Tr. 45.) The December 2019 credit report reflects no delinquent accounts except \nfor the cellphone debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.b and his student loans. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is not established by the evidence. When \nApplicant admitted this debt, he thought it was another account on which he was making \nregular payments. The debt alleged in the SOR is not reflected in the December 2019 \ncredit report, and it was placed for collection in April 2019, making it too recent to have \n\u201caged off\u201d his credit record under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which prohibits credit \nbureaus from listing any accounts placed for collection, charged-off debts, or civil \njudgments that antedate the credit report by more than seven years or until the statute of \nlimitations has run, whichever is longer. The exceptions to this prohibition do not apply to \nthis debt. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. \nThe student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d appears to be included in the student loan \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). \nAccordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record regarding the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are sufficient to establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s debts are not numerous, but they \nare recent and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are not fully established. Applicant\u2019s divorce, periods of \nunemployment, and periods of underemployment were conditions largely beyond his \ncontrol. However, he has not acted responsibly. He took no action to resolve the cellphone \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b until after the hearing. \u201cA person who begins to address \nconcerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her access is in jeopardy \nmay lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019, citing ISCR Case No. \n17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). His approach to his student loans has been \npassive, allowing involuntary diversions of his tax returns and garnishment of his wages \ninstead of actively seeking to resolve them. Payment by involuntary garnishment, \u201cis not \nthe same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-06058 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2009). Applicant has applied for a consolidation loan, but his application is pending \nand not yet approved. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established, Applicant has not submitted evidence of counseling \nand his financial problems are not under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service and his candor and sincerity at the hearing. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On February 6, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F.

I convened the hearing absent the applicant, and continued the \ncase to a date to be determined. (See Transcript (Tr.) for September 29, 2020 hearing; \nExhibit I) On October 6, 2020, DOHA issued a notice of hearing rescheduling the \nhearing for December 2, 2020. The hearing was convened as rescheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 12 were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection. I held the \nrecord open until January 29, 2021, to afford Applicant an opportunity to submit \nadditional evidence. He timely submitted AE B through E, which were admitted without \nobjection. On December 21, 2020, DOHA received the hearing transcript.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged 18 allegations under Guideline F. His admissions and \ndenials are broken down as follows. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, \n1.m, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r., with explanations.

Additional findings of fact follow.  \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old business analyst who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since January 2019. (GE 1; Tr. 12-13) He seeks to retain his secret \nsecurity clearance, which is a requirement of his continued employment. (Tr. 33-34) \nApplicant has held a clearance since he was on active duty in the Navy, discussed \nbelow. (Tr. 33-34)  \n \nApplicant received his high school diploma in 1979. He went on to earn a \nbachelor of science degree in management in 2015, and a master of business \nadministration degree in 2016. (Tr. 14-15, 26-28; AE A) He served in the U.S. Navy \nfrom February 1983 to January 1992, and was honorably discharged as an Operations \nSpecialist First Class (pay grade E-6). Before he was discharged, he had been selected \nfor chief petty officer, was surface warfare qualified, and had earned \u201cseveral ribbons \nand awards.\u201d (Tr. 16-17) After Applicant\u2019s separation from the Navy, he held a number \nof jobs, primarily as a defense contractor at various U.S. locations. (GE 1; Tr. 17-26)  \n \nApplicant was married from 1983 to 1988, and that marriage ended by divorce. \nHe has one adult son from that marriage. Applicant remarried in 1989, and has five \nadult children from his second marriage. All of the children from his second marriage \nare living at home and dependent on him for support. (GE 1; Tr. 16, 28-33, 41) His wife \nis a homemaker and is not employed outside the home. (Tr. 33) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR listed 18 allegations under this concern consisting of 15 debts \ntotaling $43,536, and three bankruptcy filings. The debts are established by his January \n28, 2015 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF-86); his April 24, \n2017 and June 24, 2015 Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interviews \n(OPM PSI); a June 30, 2015 Joint Personnel Adjudications System (JPAS) Incident \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nHistory; his July 10, 2020, October 1, 2019, June 6, 2017,  and February 10, 2015 credit \nreports; his July 26, 2011 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Documents; November 21, 2011 \nChapter 13 Bankruptcy Documents; April 17, 2012 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Documents; \nJuly 11, 2005 Sworn Affidavit; and his March 10, 2020 SOR Answer. (SOR Answer; GE \n1-12)  \n \nApplicant stated that his financial problems began during his first marriage \nbecause of his former spouse\u2019s misuse of credit cards and overspending without \nconsulting him. Some of the debts from his first marriage continued after Applicant \nremarried. He did not become aware of a large credit-card debt his former spouse had \nincurred until 1992, when he attempted to buy a car. In addition, he paid child support \nfor the son born during his first marriage, even though he claims not to be that son\u2019s \nbiological father. Applicant filed his first bankruptcy, which was not alleged in the SOR, \nin the late 1990\u2019s. Applicant stated that he filed that bankruptcy because he had five \nchildren and the \u201cbills were compounding.\u201d (Tr. 34-44; GE 12)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of indebtedness included a number of debts listed in his 2003 \nChapter 13 bankruptcy and not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 43-46; GE 12) Applicant\u2019s June \n30, 2020 JPAS Incident History documents Applicant\u2019s extensive history of \ngarnishments and indebtedness from 2005 to 2019. One of the garnishments came \nabout because he accepted funds from FEMA, discussed below. (Tr. 46-47, 51; GE 4) \nApplicant stated the two 2011 Chapter 13 bankruptcies were \u201cmistakes\u201d that ultimately \nled to his filing a 2012 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He was granted a discharge of his \nnonpriority unsecured debts in 2014. (Tr. 47-48) Department Counsel questioned \nApplicant about a 2012 $15,000 civil judgment against him involving a condominium he \nattempted to purchase from a \u201cshipmate.\u201d Applicant was evicted from the condominium \nwith a $15,000 judgment against him. (Tr. 48-50) \n \nShortly after Applicant was evicted from the condominium in 2012, he relocated \nhis family to a rental home in a coastal community that was struck by a hurricane before \nhe moved in. Applicant applied to FEMA for financial aid to recover from the hurricane. \nApplicant stated that as part of the condition to receive financial aid, he was required to \nmove out of state, which he did. FEMA subsequently determined that he was ineligible \nto receive the aid because he did not lose anything and attempted to recover the funds \npaid to him. FEMA ultimately garnished Applicant\u2019s wages for $9,300. (Tr. 51-54) \n \nAs noted, Applicant\u2019s SOR listed 18 allegations consisting of 15 debts totaling \n$43,536 and three bankruptcies. These debts vary in type of creditor and amount and \nrange from a $52 delinquent medical bill to a $26,530 charged-off automobile loan. \nApplicant explained that he had taken, or was taking, various steps to address these \ndebts. However, he did not produce any documentary evidence to corroborate his \nclaims of settlement, payments made, or attempts to resolve these debts. Nor did \nApplicant\u2019s SOR Answer contain any documentation of debt resolution. Applicant stated \nthat he sent \u201cabout 17 letters\u201d to creditors seeking resolution of his debts, but had not \nreceived any replies. (Tr. 56-70) He did not submit copies of any of the letters as \nexhibits. Applicant submitted an unexecuted mitigation plan to regain financial \nresponsibility. (AE A) \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nApplicant lost his employment through a reduction in force (RIF) and he was \nunemployed from March 2013 to September 2014. During this timeframe, Applicant \ndrew unemployment for six months and withdrew money from his 401K for living \nexpenses. (Tr. 73, 75, 78; GE 1) An investigator with the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) interviewed Applicant on June 24, 2015, and April 24, 2017 \nregarding his financial situation. Applicant explained that he did not send letters to \ncreditors after his 2017 OPM interview because he was RIF\u2019d a second time and \nunemployed from January 2018 to January 2019. However, Applicant did not reinitiate \nhis plan to establish payment plans with his creditors after beginning his current \nemployment in January 2019. After Applicant was RIF\u2019d, he drew unemployment for six \nmonths and used his savings and money from his 401K for living expenses. (Tr. 58-59, \n74, 78) Applicant stated that after beginning his current job his focus was on providing \nfor his family and regaining his financial footing. He added that after the COVID-19 \nlockdown, three of his adult children who were working lost their jobs and moved in with \nhim. (Tr. 59, 74) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant submitted a matrix summary that reflected his debts \nwere pending verification except for two debts that he claimed were current. He did not \nsubmit any documentation that reflected any of his SOR debts were resolved. (AE A) \nThe monthly budget Applicant submitted at his hearing reflected a net monthly income \nof $7,200 with a net monthly remainder of $2,076. However, he orally amended that \nmonthly remainder during his testimony because his expenses had gone up after his \nson and two daughters lost their jobs and were dependent on him for support. He \nestimated his net monthly remainder was \u201cprobably about $200 to $300 a month right \nnow.\u201d (Tr. 70-71; AE A)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he was earning a good income since he began \nworking for his current employer, but had experienced a financial setback. He stated he \nhad \u201csix people that were relying on my income to sustain them and pay their bills, and \npay my bills and also pay the debt that I had with my friends.\u201d Applicant explained that \nhis budget was pre-COVID. (Tr. 72-73, 76-77) He also submitted evidence of a \nbusiness he formed in 2018 to develop a business process for Government \nprocurement and acquisition. (AE A) The record does not contain any evidence that \nApplicant derived any income from this business. He completed an online credit-\ncounseling course, date unknown. (AE A) \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I advised Applicant that he had not mitigated his \ndebts. (Tr. 77) As noted, I held the record open until January 29, 2021, to afford him an \nopportunity to submit additional evidence. I informed him that he needed to produce \ndocumentation for each SOR debt and an updated budget among other things. (Tr. 77-\n83) As noted Applicant timely submitted AE B through E. However, his post-hearings \nsubmissions did not contain any documentation demonstrating that the 15 listed SOR \ndebts had been mitigated or addressed in any meaningful way apart from what appears \nto be a settlement agreement that may be linked to SOR \u00b6 1.i (credit-card collection \naccount for $219). The settlement agreement provided indicates three $72 payments \nremained.

However, Applicant did not provide documentation of debt resolution in his \npost-hearing exhibits except for one debt that may have been listed on his SOR. (AE D-\nE) He stated in his forwarding email, \u201cNote: Creditors were not forthcoming with \nagreement documents.\u201d  \n  \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s resume documents a post-Navy career primarily as a defense \ncontractor. He submitted two work-related professional certificates. (AE A) His company \npresident wrote a favorable reference letter on his behalf, stating that Applicant is \nrequired to maintain a secret security clearance to remain on the company\u2019s current \ncontract. The company president also lauded Applicant\u2019s performance noting that \nApplicant received \u201cgreat reviews\u201d from the Government customer and his peers. He \nadded that the company considers Applicant \u201ca key role in the success of the project.\u201d \nApplicant received a \u201c100/100\u201d for his most recent employee performance review. (AE \nB, AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \n\u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented as noted above. Applicant\u2019s \nSOR lists 15 delinquent debts totaling $43,536. The majority of his debts have been \ndelinquent for more than two years. The Government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions.   \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially mitigating conditions under these facts: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n  \nThe Appeal Board explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility to prove applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. Therefore, \nhis debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in resolving his debts warrants partial application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(b) and 20(c). With regard to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant presented evidence of several \nevents beyond his control to include loss of employment and taking on the unplanned \nadded expense of supporting three of his five adult children. However, he has been \nworking full time and earning a good salary since January 2019. Applicant did not \nestablish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \n[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. \n03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained \ncontact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent. With regard to AG \u00b6 20(c), although Applicant took an online credit-counseling \ncourse, there is no clear indication that his financial status is being resolved or is under \ncontrol. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. The Appeal Board has previously explained what \nconstitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], \nan applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at \nresolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she \nrelied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim \nthe benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nAdditionally, Applicant indicated in his post-hearing submission that the statute of \nlimitation barred a number of his debts. Security clearance decisions are not controlled \nor limited by statutes of limitations. A statute of limitations may limit the legal \ncollectability of a debt; however, an administrative judge is required to consider the \nhistory of the debt\u2019s resolution as well as its current status. A security clearance \nadjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. \nRather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Accordingly, even if a delinquent debt is legally unenforceable under \nstate law, an administrative judge is required to consider the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely \nmanner. ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 17, 2015).  \n \n \nParticularly problematic is Applicant\u2019s lack of reasonably available corroborating \ndocumentation. I informed Applicant at the conclusion of the hearing of documentation \nthat could mitigate his debts. It is well established under DOHA case law that applicants \nhave the burden of presenting reasonably available corroborating documentation, and if \nthey do not, their claims of payments or payment plans are entitled to less weight. ISCR \nCase No. 15-05478 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017) and ISCR Case No. 15-04851 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2017). AG \u00b6 20(e) is not relevant. In sum, Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis section under \nGuideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are \nwarranted. \nAlthough the rationale for continuing Applicant\u2019s security clearance is insufficient \nto support national security eligibility at this time, there are several factors tending to \nsupport potential future approval of his access to classified information. Applicant is a \n59-year-old business analyst, who has the background and experience to understand \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nand comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for his years \nof service working as a defense contractor that were preceded by his ten years of active \nduty Navy service. He was honorably discharged as an Operations Specialist First \nClass and had been selected for chief petty officer, but opted to get out of the Navy and \npursue a career as a defense contractor. He went on to earn a bachelor of science \ndegree and an MBA while raising five children from his second marriage.  \n \nThere is every indication that Applicant is a law abiding citizen and loyal to the \nUnited States and his employer. His post-divorce expenses, two RIFs, periods of \nunemployment, and the added expenses of supporting all five of his adult children \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to his financial woes. His company \npresident lauds his diligence, professionalism, and responsibility. I give Applicant \nsubstantial credit for accepting responsibility for making poor financial choices, and for \nbeing honest to the OPM investigator and during his hearing testimony about his \nfinancial situation. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \n \nThe whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Applicant\u2019s SOR listed 15 delinquent debts totaling \n$43,536. Additionally, his SOR listed two 2011 Chapter 13 bankruptcies that eventually \nmerged into a 2012 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, for which he was granted a discharge in \n2014. His history of indebtedness did not begin with his 2011 Chapter 11 bankruptcies. \nIt goes back even further to his bankruptcy in the late 1990s and a history of \ngarnishments from 2005 to 2019. Although Applicant experienced several events \nbeyond his control, the record does not establish that he acted in a prudent and \nresponsible manner. His extensive history of financial problems, and inability to \nestablish a documented pattern of financial responsibility, preclude a favorable \nadjudication under the Guidelines at this time. Applicant has failed to make sufficient \nprogress in resolving his delinquent SOR debts. Applicant produced an unexecuted \nmitigation plan, which if implemented may very well get him to the point where he \nestablishes a documented track record of financial responsibility. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.r: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Although the record does not mention when or why that clearance lapsed, there is no indication that it was terminated for cause. This is her first application for a public trust position. While she is currently unemployed, her application is being sponsored by a prospective employer. (Items 2, 3; FORM Response) Applicant admitted each of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling $58,960, including a $369 utility account; a $2,199 auto-loan account; nine credit-card accounts totaling $45,748; and delinquent federal taxes totaling $10,644. These debts remain unresolved. She has not sought any financial counseling. After consulting with an attorney in 2015 to discuss her bankruptcy options, she decided not to file. Instead she plans to \u201cchip away\u201d at her SOR debts, which will become a priority, once she becomes gainfully employed again. She expects that she will be \u201cout of debt . . . in no time\u201d with the income she expects to receive from her prospective employer.

On April 10, 2020, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F.

Applicant did not object to any of the Items included in the FORM. Items 1 \nand 2 are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted into evidence. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer included a document that is admitted into evidence as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 55, divorced in 2005. She has two adult children. She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1987. She was granted a DOD security clearance in 2005. Although \nthe record does not mention when or why that clearance lapsed, there is no indication \nthat it was terminated for cause. This is her first application for a public trust position. \nWhile she is currently unemployed, her application is being sponsored by a prospective \nemployer. (Items 2, 3; FORM Response) \nApplicant admitted each of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling \n$58,960, including a $369 utility account; a $2,199 auto-loan account; nine credit-card \naccounts totaling $45,748; and delinquent federal taxes totaling $10,644. These debts \nremain unresolved. She has not sought any financial counseling. After consulting with an \nattorney in 2015 to discuss her bankruptcy options, she decided not to file. Instead she \nplans to \u201cchip away\u201d at her SOR debts, which will become a priority, once she becomes \ngainfully employed again. She expects that she will be \u201cout of debt . . . in no time\u201d with \nthe income she expects to receive from her prospective employer. (Item 2; Item 4 at 9; \nFORM response) \nApplicant attributed her indebtedness to extended periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment that began in about 2014. During these times, she withdrew funds from \nher retirement account and used credit cards to \u201ckeep afloat\u201d and pay bills. She prioritized \npaying her current expenses, resolving her home mortgage debt to avoid foreclosure \ntwice, and financially supporting her children through college, over repaying her SOR \ndebts. (Item 2; Item 4 at 17; FORM Response) \nPrior to a March 2012 layoff, Applicant was gainfully employed in the same position \nfor almost eight years. She was unemployed for two months between March 2012 and \nMay 2012, 11 months between March 2013 and February 2014 (after she was fired for \nperformance issues), and 10 months between March 2018 and January 2019 (after \nanother layoff). She has been unemployed since November 2019 for reasons not \nspecified in the record. Applicant reported that, between February 2014 and June 2017, \nher salary was $25,000 less than what she earned from her two prior employers. Despite \nthe substantial salary differential, she stayed in that position, in part, because she loved \nthe job so much. She did not otherwise detail her income history in the record. (Item 2; \nItem 4 at 8, 14; FORM Response) \nApplicant also did not enumerate her expense history in the record. However, her \ncredit reports revealed that she has neither incurred any new debts nor opened any new \naccounts since 2017, and is managing her current finances responsibly without the use \nof credit cards. She has owned her home since 2005. As of January 2020, both her first \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand second mortgage-loan accounts were in good standing with the help of a \u201clarge sum \nof money\u201d that she borrowed from her father and a lender-approved loan modification. \nHer combined monthly payment was $894, and the remaining balances were $137,335 \nand $29,344, respectively. Applicant opened five federal student-loan accounts between \n2013 and 2017, totaling $21,550, which were in deferment status in January 2020. The \nrecord suggests that the student loans were opened for the benefit of at least one of her \nchildren. In January 2020, Applicant had one auto-loan account (opened in 2014) that \nwas in good standing, with a $284 monthly payment and a $2,142 remaining balance. \n(Item 2 at 4; Item 4 at 12; Items 6-8) \nDuring her unemployment period in 2012, Applicant was financially supported by \nfunds withdrawn from her retirement account. Between March 2013 and February 2014, \nshe was supported by unemployment benefits and retirement funds. Between March \n2019 and December 2018, she was supported by unemployment benefits. From \nSeptember or October 2018 through at least February 2019, Applicant earned income \nworking for a ride-sharing company on the weekends. Since November 2019, she has \nbeen supported by unemployment benefits and \u201ca little bit of help\u201d from her family. When \nshe withdrew funds at various times from her retirement account, she incurred taxes and \nearly withdrawal fees. The record did not specify the amounts of her retirement account \nwithdrawals and associated fees, unemployment benefits, part-time income, or family \nsupport. (Item 2 at 4; Item 4 at 8, 16) \nApplicant is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $10,644 for delinquent federal \nincome taxes for tax years (TY) 2014 through 2016. In her SOR answer, she claimed that \nher TY 2019 refund was applied to reduce the balance to $9,002. In her FORM response, \nshe claimed that the balance had been further reduced to $5,823 for reasons not \nspecified. She did not provide any documents to corroborate her claims. Applicant plans \nto make monthly payments to resolve her tax debts as soon as she begins working again. \n(Item 2; Item 4 at 28-30) \nApplicant experienced issues paying her federal income taxes beginning in TY \n2012 and initiated efforts to resolve her delinquencies at various times since then. She \nestablished an installment agreement with the IRS to repay her TY 2012 debt in August \n2013. She made four payments totaling $1,395 in 2013. She paid $200 in 2014 and $100 \nin 2015. In September 2015, her first agreement lapsed and a tax lien was issued. She \nestablished a second installment agreement in October 2015, which lapsed in November \n2016. After a tax lien was issued, she established a third installment agreement in June \n2017. She made four payments totaling $719 in 2017. She made $200 monthly payments \nbetween January and August 2018. Refunds from federal taxes she paid in TY 2013 and \n2017 totaling $2,755 were applied to her TY 2012 debt, which was resolved in August \n2018. (Item 4 at 18-20, 30-31) \nApplicant established an installment agreement with the IRS to repay her TY 2014 \ndebt in October 2015. She paid $30 to the IRS in July 2016. Her first agreement lapsed \nin November 2016. After a tax lien was issued in May 2017, Applicant established a \nsecond installment agreement in June 2017. Refunds totaling $4,948, from federal taxes \nshe paid in TY 2012, 2017, and 2018, were applied to her TY 2014 debt in April 2018, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 2018, and April 2019. For a period between August 2018 and October 2019, her \nTY 2014 account was in \u201cnot collectible\u201d status. The TY 2014 account has been \nconsidered collectible since October 2019. (Item 4 at 21-22, 30-31) \nNeither direct payments to the IRS nor refunds from other tax years were applied \ntowards Applicant\u2019s TY 2015 and 2016 debts. After a tax lien was issued in May 2017, \nshe established an installment agreement for TY 2015. That agreement lapsed in August \n2018. For a period between August 2018 and October 2019, her TY 2015 account was in \n\u201cnot collectible\u201d status. The TY 2015 account has been considered collectible since \nOctober 2019. She has not established any installment agreements for TY 2016. (Item 4 \nat 23-24). \nApplicant did not timely file her federal or state income tax returns for TY 2016 \nthrough 2018. She did not timely file in TY 2016 because she knew that she would owe \nextra money due to having withdrawn funds from her retirement account. She did not \nspecify the reasons that she failed to timely file in TY 2017 and 2018. She filed her TY \n2017 returns in July 2018, and her TY 2016 and 2018 returns in November 2019. Because \nher failure to timely file her returns was not alleged in the SOR, I will consider it only to \nevaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. (Item 4 at 2-3, 9, 25-27) \nApplicant\u2019s paycheck was garnished by State A in 2015 for delinquent state income \ntaxes for TY 2014. State A also garnished her paycheck in 2017 for delinquent taxes for \nTY 2015 through 2016. As of January 2020, she owed no taxes to State A for TY 2012 \nthrough 2018. The record did not specify the amount of delinquent state taxes that were \npaid by Applicant either directly or via the garnishments. (Item 4 at 10, 15, 32-38) \nApplicant has spent more than half of her career working for various defense \ncontractors in support of the U.S. Navy. She proffered that she is \u201cvery loyal and \ntrustworthy\u201d and has a \u201ctop notch work ethic.\u201d She described herself as \u201cdependable, \ndetermined, passionate, and honest.\u201d She asserted that she is \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d \ncommitted to making a difference by continuing to serve the federal government. (Item 2; \nFORM response) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \n(Directive, \u00a7 3.2) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust to support a DOD \ncontract, an administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nin the AG. (Directive, Enclosure 2). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthe guidelines in a commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable \ninformation, in arriving at a fair and impartial decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the guidelines, the Directive sets forth procedures that must be \nfollowed in trustworthiness adjudications. The Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to establish his or her eligibility for a public trust position. (Directive, Enclosure \n3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15). The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and her credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nfinancial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required). \nThe following are potentially applicable factors that could mitigate the security \nconcerns raised in the SOR: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20 (c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has a significant amount of debt that \nremains unresolved, including unpaid federal taxes. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant did not meet her burden to establish \nthat the SOR debts were accrued (and have persisted) largely due to circumstances \nbeyond her control. Her March 2012 and March 2018 layoffs were circumstances beyond \nher control. However, her March 2013 firing was not. Not only did she fail to proffer a \nreason for her November 2019 job loss, but receipt of unemployment benefits does not \nunequivocally demonstrate that her separation was involuntary. Thus, I am unable to \nconclude that it was a circumstance beyond her control. Since she stayed in the position, \nin part, because she loved the job so much, I am also unable to conclude that her \nFebruary 2014 through June 2017 period of underemployment was a circumstance \nlargely beyond her control. \nEven if the evidence was sufficient for me to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is largely due to circumstances beyond her control, there is a paucity of evidence \nin the record demonstrating that she acted responsibly given her circumstances. She did \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot provide a complete picture of her income and expense history. On one hand, she \ncited her mortgage debt as an issue that prevented her from addressing her debt. On the \nother hand, the record did not specify whether or how much she paid to her mortgage \nlender from her own funds. The amounts of any lingering liability to repay the loans from \nher retirement account, father, and other family are unknown. There was also no evidence \nin the record about how much money she borrowed from her retirement account, and to \nwhat expenses or debts those retirement funds were applied. Although she paid a total \nof $4,044 between 2013 and 2018 towards her unpaid federal taxes, there was no \nevidence in the record of how much she paid to resolve her state taxes either directly or \nvia garnishment. Finally, she admitted to prioritizing supporting her children through \ncollege over paying her delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought any financial counseling. \nEven if she received such counseling during her consultation with the attorney about filing \nbankruptcy (which was not specified in the record), she did not establish that her \nindebtedness is under control at this time. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. The extent to which Applicant\u2019s taxes were \nresolved either via garnishment or the application of refunds from other tax years cannot \nbe considered good-faith effort. However, she is credited with resolving her mortgage \ndebt, the efforts and direct payments she made towards resolving her federal tax debt, \nand managing her current finances responsibly without the use of credit cards. She is \nalso credited with consulting with an attorney to consider whether to file bankruptcy. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant communicated with the IRS about her \nfinancial situation, established installment agreements to repay her federal taxes, and \nmade direct payments to the IRS. While she was required to timely file her tax returns \nregardless of whether she could afford to pay her taxes, she responsibly filed her \ndelinquent tax returns well before the issuance of the SOR. She resolved her TY 2012 \ntax debt similarly. However, significant federal tax debt remains unresolved. The record \ndid not specify why she never established an installment agreement to repay her TY 2016 \nfederal tax debt. Applicant did not prove that her TY 2014 through 2016 federal tax debts \nwere reduced as claimed. \nI considered the progress that Applicant made in addressing her delinquent \nmortgage and tax debts, and the fact that she is not required to be debt-free in order to \nmerit a favorable determination about her eligibility for a position of trust. I also considered \nthat her current unemployment status impacts her ability to make payments towards her \ndebts, particularly amid the economic uncertainties associated with the pandemic. \nHowever, due to the lack of specific information and corroborating documents in several \nkey areas of mitigation, Applicant has failed to meet her burden to overcome the concerns \nsurrounding the substantial debts, including unpaid federal taxes, which remain \nunresolved. \nThere is insufficient evidence for me to conclude that Applicant will be able to follow \nthrough with her plan for repaying her SOR debts once she is gainfully employed; and \nthat her indebtedness is not likely to recur. However sincere she may be in her \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination to resolve her delinquent debts without filing bankruptcy, in light of the \nrecord before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated trustworthiness concerns \nraised by her indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant her eligibility for \na public trust position. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 35 years old. He is divorced and has two daughters with his ex-wife, and a recent son with a girlfriend. He has a high school diploma. Applicant has no prior military service. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR identified seven delinquent debts, totaling approximately $18,464, consisting primarily of consumer debt, under this guideline. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the allegations, except allegation 1.b., asserting that the debt has been settled. A credit report of the Applicant dated October 17, 2018, confirms that at that time the debts were owing. (Government Exhibit 4.) Applicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were due to gambling, marital separation and divorce, medical bills related to the birth of a child, low income, and bad financial decisions. (Government Exhibit 8.) Applicant\u2019s security clearance application dated September 2018, states that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties from September 2013 to June 2018 resulted from gambling related to drin",

(Item 3.)  On March 6, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.)  The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 7, 2020. He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.) On \nJuly 22, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \n\n \n2 \n \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing nine exhibits, was \nsent to the Applicant and received on July 24, 2020. The FORM notified Applicant that \nhe had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  Applicant responded to the FORM \non a date uncertain, and submitted a five page document, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without objection.  DOHA assigned the \ncase to me on September 22, 2020. Items 1 through 9 are admitted into evidence and \nhereinafter referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9.     \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 35 years old.  He is divorced and has two daughters with his ex-wife, \nand a recent son with a girlfriend.  He has a high school diploma.  Applicant has no prior \nmilitary service.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.        \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.   \n  \nThe SOR identified seven delinquent debts, totaling approximately $18,464, \nconsisting primarily of consumer debt, under this guideline.  In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admits all of the allegations, except allegation 1.b., asserting that the debt has \nbeen settled.  A credit report of the Applicant dated October 17, 2018, confirms that at \nthat time the debts were owing.  (Government Exhibit 4.)        \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties were due to gambling, marital separation and divorce, medical bills \nrelated to the birth of a child, low income, and bad financial decisions.  (Government \nExhibit 8.)  Applicant\u2019s security clearance application dated September 2018, states that \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties from September 2013 to June 2018 resulted from \ngambling related to drinking alcohol.  Applicant stated that, \u201cI put all of those things \nbehind me because I decided to make changes in my life for the better.\u201d  (Government \nExhibit 3.)  Applicant also stated that he retained Lexington Law firm to help resolve his \ndebts, but recently confirmed that he stopped using the services in March 2019.  \n(Government Exhibit 8.)   \n \nThe following delinquent debt listed in the SOR is of security significance: \n \n1.a., Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $5,867.   Applicant states that he is working on paying off the \ndebt.  At this time, the debt remains outstanding. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n1.b., Applicant is indebted to the state for child support, an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $4,960.  Applicant claims that the debt has \nbeen settled.  He submitted a copy of a check in the amount of $2,482.92 dated \nJanuary 23, 2020, issued by an Attorney Trust Account to the Treasurer of his state \nregarding Applicant.  Applicant also contends that the balance owed of $2,482.92 was \ngarnished on a bi-weekly basis in the amount of $150 or $300 monthly to resolve the \ndebt.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  This debt is being or has been resolved.  \n \n1.c.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $4,793.  Applicant settled the debt in the amount of $1,438.  His \nlast payment of $312.67 was received by the creditor on June 20, 2020.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A.)  This debt has been resolved.   \n \n1.d.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $1,245.  Applicant has provided a receipt for emergency \nmedical services rendered on May 9, 2018.  The receipt shows that there is a zero \nbalance owed on the account as of August 21, 2020.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  This debt \nhas been resolved.  \n \n1.e.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $717.  Applicant has provided a receipt dated June 22, 2020, \nshowing that Capital One Bank was the original creditor.  The receipt shows that there \nis a zero balance owed on the account as of June 22, 2020.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nThis debt has been resolved. \n \n1.f.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $586.  Applicant has provided a receipt dated May 28, 2020, \nshowing that LVNG Funding is the current owner of the debt and that the account was \nsettled in full on May 13, 2020.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  This debt has been resolved. \n \n1.g.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $296.  Applicant states that he is working on paying off the debt.  \nAt this time, the debt remains outstanding. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n\n \n4 \n \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d  The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are possibly applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nSince Applicant decided to stop gambling and drinking alcohol, he has been \nworking to pay off his delinquent debts and has incurred no new debt.  He has settled or \npaid in full all but two of his seven outstanding debts.  At this point, however, he still \nremains indebted to two creditors owing in excess of $6,000.  He has presented no \nevidence to show that he has done anything to resolve these two debts.  The record is \nalso void of any mitigation concerning his level of trustworthiness and reliability.  Under \nthe circumstances, Applicant has failed to demonstrate that he is eligible for a security \nclearance. \n       \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s history shows that he encountered some circumstances beyond his \ncontrol that contributed to his financial indebtedness, like his marital separation and \n\n \n6 \n \ndivorce.  He also made some poor decisions that exacerbated his financial difficulties \nsuch as gambling and drinking.  Recently, Applicant has been working on resolving his \npast delinquent debts.  He has either paid off or settled five of the seven debts listed in \nthe SOR, and hopefully soon in the future, will begin to work to resolve the remaining \ntwo debts.  At this point, he continues to owe in excess of $6,000 toward the remaining \ntwo debts.  Applicant has not resolved his indebtedness enough to show that he is \nfiscally responsible.  Accordingly, eligibility for a security clearance is denied.    \n     \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.g:    \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b., through 1.f.  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n  \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

H. Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n08/11/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case invokes security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Applicant presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 6, 2020, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that \nraise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed Applicant that, \nbased on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a review based on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2020. \nDepartment Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated April 30, 2020. \nThe Government submitted nine Items for the record. Applicant responded to the FORM \nin a timely fashion with a packet of documents labeled A through F. All documents were \nadmitted into the record. \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 49, is married and has two adult children. He completed \nrequirements for an undergraduate degree in May 2018 and obtained his degree. (Answer \nto FORM, D) He accomplished this while working full time. He served in the United States \nNavy from 1989 until 2009, when he retired honorably. Applicant completed a security \nclearance application on February 9, 2018. (Item 3) He is currently working for a federal \ncontractor, which he began in 2018. He initially held a security clearance in the military \nand maintained his clearance after retirement in the contracting field. (Items 2 and 3) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent debts and two judgments for a \ntotal amount of debt of $87,000. Applicant admits all the SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.g, and provides explanations. (Item 1) \n \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties, his inability to maintain financial \nstability, and pay all his debts to a \u201crough patch\u201d in 2014, 2015, and 2016. His wife was \nnot working; he housed his mother-in-law who had stage-four cancer; and his father-in-\nlaw who was unemployed. In addition, he admits that he overextended himself financially. \n(Answer to FORM) He paid for medical treatments for his mother-in-law that exacerbated \nhis financial difficulties. Applicant admits to making some poor judgments.  \n \nApplicant stated that he did not try to escape from his financial obligations. He \nattempted to reduce expenses by modifying his home mortgage. He failed to do so, \nmoved out, and rented another place. He had rented a small apartment for his wife on the \nmainland because he was to be transferred there by his command. However, the transfer \ndid not take place. He could not maintain the home mortgage loan and the rent. (Item 3) \nBefore the home went to foreclosure, Applicant was able to sell it. Applicant admits that \nhe should have acted sooner. His in-laws do not live with him now. It is not clear when \nthey left Applicant\u2019s home, but it was sometime after 2016. His wife is now working. \n(Answer to FORM) \n \nHe admits being scared and stressed and not able to navigate his way. (Answer \nto FORM) Applicant realizes that this is not an excuse. He also discusses having major \nrepairs with his vehicles and the need to purchase a car in 2016, which also exacerbated \nhis financial difficulties. He regrets not seeking legal help sooner for the vehicle issue. In \n2018, Applicant was unemployed for a short period for health reasons. (Answer to FORM) \n \nApplicant has a budget and provided a bill-paying checklist. The documents shows \nhis creditors and the amounts he is currently paying on the accounts. It also shows a \nmonthly net total income of about $11,000, including military retirement pay and military \ndisability pay. He has a net remainder. (Answer to FORM, E) \n \nApplicant\u2019s combined credit report reflects that he has multiple accounts that were \npaid as agreed. Some of these accounts go back as far as 2003. (Item 4) The delinquent \ndebts originated on his credit report after the 2014, 2015, and 2016, events that are \ndescribed in the finding of facts above. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant had a November 2, 2018 judgment entered against him \nin the approximate amount of $36,353. This judgment is the result of an automobile loan \nthat Applicant obtained in 2016. The account was past due, and the car was repossessed.  \nApplicant has been making payments to the debt collector since August 2018. He \nprovided an account summary reflecting that he has paid a total of $1,600 with consistent \nmonthly payments of $200 since 2018. (Answer to FORM, A) \n \n As to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant admits the 2014 judgment entered against him for \n$7,849 for non-payment of a home owner association debt. He paid the account in full in \nJune 2017 from the proceeds of the sale of the home property. (Item 1) \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant admits that he is indebted for a charged-off account in \nthe amount of $29,268 for a consolidation loan. The consolidation loan was obtained from \nthe same institution as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant has been making $200 monthly \npayments consistently since August 2018 to the debt collector. He provided an account \nsummary reflecting a total of $1,400 paid on the account. (Answer to FORM, A) \n. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant admits he is indebted for an account that is past due in \nthe amount of approximately $406, with a total balance of $4,626. He states that he has \nbeen current on this account for several months and provided a March 2020 account \nsummary to show nothing past due and a record of payments made on the account. (Item \n1) \n \nThe charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.e, for $4,626, is the result of a credit card \naccount. Applicant provided a confirmation of electronic transfers from his bank deposit \naccount. The payment plan shows the payments starting in July 2020 and continuing until \nApril 2023. He provided documentation of one payment of $128.51 made in June, 2020. \n(Answer to FORM) \n \nThe charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.f in the amount of $482.27 is in a repayment \nstatus. Applicant made his first payment of $96.40 on April 2, 2020. (Item 1) He stated \nthat he has eight payments remaining.  \n \nAs to the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.g, for a charged-off account in the amount of \n$9,005, Applicant admits that he initially incurred this debt. However, he contests the \namount owed. He takes responsibility because it is in his name. He explained the cause \nof the debt in his subject interview in great detail. (Item 3) In 2016, he traded in his vehicle \nfor another car. He presented documentation that part of the agreement was a down \npayment of $6,000 cash, and the trade in. (Answer to FORM, C) The car dealer was to \ntake the vehicle that was traded, sell it, and pay off the balance of the loan. (Answer to \nSOR) The agreement was not honored, and Applicant has attempted to resolve this issue \nsince at least 2017. The car dealer wanted another $6,000, which Applicant did not \npossess.  \n \nApplicant has been working with a law firm to resolve the financial issue raised in \nSOR 1.g. (Answer to FORM, C) Since 2017, Applicant has made many efforts to resolve \nthis matter. The law firm contacted the car dealer, who promising to resolve the issue, \n\n \n4 \n \nhas not. The sales contract confirms Applicant\u2019s description of the event. He provided a \nletter from his attorney and the 2016 sales contract. His legal team advises that the \noriginal car dealer is liable for the balance of the car loan and not the Applicant. The letter \nfrom his attorney refers to an unfair and deceptive trade practice. (Answer to FORM, C) \nApplicant intends to resolve the matter with the assistance of the law firm. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgements, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n \n6 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provide \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are the result of a multitude of circumstances beyond \nhis control that began in 2014. He took care of his wife\u2019s parents by housing them and \nproviding medical care for his mother-in-law who had cancer and his father-in-law, who \nwas unemployed. He also was the sole provider for the family. This was an exceptional \ncircumstance. He had to deal financially with a terminally ill family member. He also \nmanaged to sell his house before foreclosure and downsize to a smaller apartment. He \ndid not receive a transfer to the mainland as was expected. This caused more financial \ndifficulties. Applicant had good credit as reflected on his credit reports before 2014. Life \nhappened and he admits that he was not as proactive as he could have been. He also \nhad difficulties with his vehicle and appears to be the victim of a deceptive or unfair car \nsales agreement by a car dealer. He did not ignore creditors and has been paying or \nresolving his debts for years. He took reasonable actions under the circumstances. He \npaid bills that he could. He paid several collection accounts. He did not ignore his \ncreditors. He is using sound judgment and paying his debts. Granted, he has not paid all \nof them, he is not required to do so all at once. He has established a track record with a \ngood payment history.  \n \nApplicant presented recent information about his payment history to the various \naccounts that have been paid. He is gainfully employed and is dedicated to paying his \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(a), is applicable in this case.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. He had several circumstances beyond his control of \nvarying degrees occurring almost simultaneously. He painstakingly listed all information \non his security clearance application and provided documentation to show exactly what \nhe has paid and what his plans are.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. He sought legal advice for one debt. He has a \nbudget.  AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant is adhering to good-faith efforts now to \naddress his financial accounts. He produced sufficient documentation to support this \nmitigating condition. Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set \nout in the SOR.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe debt and has taken appropriate actions to resolve the debt.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including his many challenging conditions beyond his control in recent \nyears, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \nindebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

He has worked for a government contractor as a \ntechnical support specialist since January 2019. He received a certificate from a \ncommunity college in 2011. His military service includes serving in the Air Force on active \nduty from 1991 to 2001. He received an honorable discharge for that service. He also \nserved in the Army National Guard from 2002 to 2005. He was also honorably discharged \nfrom that service. He is divorced and has two adult children. (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling approximately $62,000. \n(Department Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.g. See FORM p. 4.) The debts are comprised of \na foreclosed mortgage account and several collections accounts (medical debt, student \nloans, and an automobile debt). The debts are supported by a credit reports from \nFebruary 2019 and October 2019, and his statement to an investigator in April 2019. \n(Items 5-7) \nApplicant offered no specific reasons for his financial distress; however, he went \nthrough a divorce in 2014 and was unemployed for over two years from January 2009 to \nNovember 2011. At the time he was interviewed by a defense investigator in April 2019, \nhe had not received any financial counseling. (Items 4-5) The status of his debts is as \nfollows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-Foreclosed Mortgage Account-($42,451). Applicant claims that \npursuant to his divorce decree, his ex-wife was responsible for the mortgage payments \nbecause she was awarded the house in their divorce. He did not offer the divorce \nsettlement in evidence. His ex-wife failed to make the required payments and the property \nwas sold through foreclosure in April 2016. Court documents show that Applicant and his \nex-wife were both named defendants in the foreclosure proceedings. There is no \nevidence of a deficiency amount owed by Applicant. This debt does not appear on his \nmost recent credit report in evidence. This debt is resolved. (Items 5, 8, 9; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-Collection Account-Repossessed Car-($12,709).

This debt is being resolved. (Items 3, 5; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d-Student Loans-($4,018; 2,779). Applicant negotiated to have \nhis student loans picked up by another lending service, and his June 2020 credit report \nreflected that he was current on his student loans, having timely made the last three \nmonths payments. These debts are being resolved. (Items 3, 8; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e-Student Loan-($246). Applicant provided documentation showing this \ndebt was paid in April 2020. This debt is resolved. (AE B.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f-Medical Debt-($65). Applicant claims he paid this debt, and it does not \nappear on either his August 2019 or his June 2020 credit reports. This debt is resolved. \n(AE 7-8) \nApplicant also provided documentation related to two other non-SOR financial \nobligations. He demonstrated that he made all his required car payments from February \n2017 through February 2020. That loan is now paid. He also documented that he is \ncurrent on a line of credit he received in 2017. (AE C-D). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19, and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence showed Applicant accrued several delinquent collection debts and \na foreclosure.

I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant claimed his ex-wife was responsible for making the mortgage payments \non the house that she received in the divorce settlement. She did not make the payments \nand a foreclosure sale resulted. This debt no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit report. \nHe also brought his two student loans current using a new creditor service and he \ndocumented his full payment on a smaller student loan. He is disputing a car repossession \ndebt. His credit reports support that he paid the delinquent medical debt. He has shown \nresponsible and reliable behavior by paying off his recent car debt and making his \nrequired payments on his line of credit. There are clear indications that his financial issues \nare either resolved or being resolved, and that recurrence is unlikely. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), \n20(d), and 20(e) all have some applicability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service, \nhis federal contractor service, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness. I am \nconvinced that Applicant will not incur delinquent debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.g:  \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.
