McCormack, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence), based on Applicant\u2019s family connections and property interests in Japan. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 24, 2006. On May \n9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on July 2, 2008; answered it on July 7, 2008; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on July \nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n9, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 24, 2008, and the case \nwas assigned to an administrative judge on October 24, 2008. The case was \nreassigned to another administrative judge on November 17, 2008, when Applicant \nexpressed a desire for a hearing on the east coast even though he lives and works in \nOkinawa, nearer to the west coast. The case was reassigned to me on December 3, \n2008, to consolidate the docket. Scheduling the hearing was delayed by Applicant\u2019s \noverseas location and the availability of his counsel. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non January 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 2, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \neach contained multiple separate documents, which were identified by a number in \naddition to a letter, e.g., AX A-1. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing on \nFebruary 2, 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2009. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request that I take administrative notice of \nrelevant facts about Japan (Tr. 17-19). The request and the documents attached as \nenclosures were not admitted in evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HX) I. The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR, \nexcept for the allegation that his spouse is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Japan. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old senior network installation technician for a defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2000. He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from October 1996 to September 2000 (AX E-1). \nWhile on active duty, he twice received the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal \n(AX E-3). He continued in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve until March 2004, when he \nwas honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay grade E-5) (AX E-2). His last fitness \nreport before his discharge described him as technically competent, exceptionally \ntalented, and a solid leader (AX E-4). He held a clearance in the Marine Corps and \nretained it when he began working for a defense contractor.  \n \nApplicant worked in network security as a Marine. He testified he believed he \ncould do more for the Marine Corps as a civilian contractor, and he began work for his \ncurrent employer while on terminal leave from the Marine Corps.  \n \n \nApplicant has been deployed to Okinawa, Japan, as a civilian contractor \nsupporting Marine Corps communications networks since his release from active duty \n(AX A-1 to A-8). He provides tactical network security for the Marines and trains them \non how to provide tactical network security in the field (Tr. 34-35). He interacts with the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nMarines daily (Tr. 35). While working as a contractor, he completed the requirements for \na bachelor of science degree in computer studies in May 2006 (AX F-3).  \n \nApplicant has no interaction with the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (Tr. 44). He \ndoes not speak Japanese, and his social circle consists of U.S. military personnel and \nfellow contractor employees (Tr. 40).   \n \n \nApplicant submitted 13 letters supporting the continuation of his security \nclearance. His program manager, who has known him for eight years, describes him as \ntrustworthy, loyal, and dedicated, and states that he conducts himself like a Marine \nofficer or senior noncommissioned officer (AX D-2). Two colleagues, one a retired chief \nmaster sergeant in the Air Force, regard him as dependable, highly respected, and \ncontinuing to live the motto of the Marines (\u201cSemper Fidelis\u201d) (AX D-4, D-5). A Marine \ncaptain (AX D-6), three chief warrant officers (AX D-10, D-8, and D-13), two master \nsergeants (AX D-7, D-9), one gunnery sergeant (AX D-12), two staff sergeants (AX D-3, \nD-4), and a sergeant (AX D-1) describe him as highly competent, trustworthy, and \ntotally dedicated to the Marines he supports. He received a certificate of commendation \nfrom the Marine Corps Base commander in August 2003 and a letter of recognition from \nthe network operations officer in March 2008 for his exceptional performance (AX F-1, \nF-13). \n \n \nApplicant married a citizen and resident of Japan in January 2002 (Tr. 26; GX 1 \nat 16). They have two sons, ages six and five, who are dual citizens of the U.S. and \nJapan (Tr. 27). His sons hold both U.S. and Japanese passports (Tr. 52). They attend \nprivate schools in Japan (Tr. 40). Until about two years ago, his spouse taught English \nto Japanese children, but she is not currently employed outside the home (Tr. 27). She \nhas never lived in the U.S., but she spent time in the U.S. as an exchange student and \nvisited once when Applicant\u2019s brother was married (Tr. 48). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Japan. His father-in-law served as a pilot in the Japanese Self-Defense \nForces and retired as a colonel in 1998 after about 36 years of service (Tr. 28). His \nbrother-in-law currently serves as a pilot in the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and \nholds the rank of major. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is employed by a financial institution in Japan that \nprovides commercial loans. His only interaction with the U.S. military is to play golf with \nsenior U.S. military officers on the Marine base (Tr. 28). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is not \ncurrently employed, but she previously worked as a professional chef (Tr. 30). \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are \u201cactive grandparents,\u201d and he and his \nspouse have regular contact with them (Tr. 30-31). Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is \nstationed on mainland Japan, and they only visit with him about every two years (Tr. \n31). As far as Applicant knows, his father-in-law and brother-in-law are not involved with \nJapanese intelligence services (Tr. 43).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law speaks broken English; his mother-in-law speaks \nvirtually no English; and his brother-in-law speaks some English but is not fluent (Tr. \n45). Conversation with his in-laws is mostly limited to \u201ccourtesy\u201d conversation about golf \nand children (Tr. 45). \n \n \nApplicant recently purchased land and built a house in Okinawa. It was \ncompleted in January 2008 at a cost of $515,000. The house was financed through the \nBank of Okinawa, which loaned him about $420,000 (Tr. 25). He was required to \nfinance the house through a Japanese bank, and he deposits funds in a Japanese bank \naccount to make the house payments (Tr. 38). He has no other financial assets in \nJapan. His primary bank account is with a U.S.-based credit union, and his credit cards \nare issued by U.S. institutions (Tr. 39). He has a retirement account worth about \n$80,000 and a savings account worth about $8,000 in U.S. institutions (Tr. 47; AX C-3, \nC-4). \n \n \nApplicant testified that the real estate market in Japan is based on the land, \nbecause there is little interest in buying previously occupied homes. He would lose \nabout 40% of his investment if he sold his home, but he would be financially able to \nhandle the loss (Tr. 46). He is financially secure and earns more than $100,000 per year \nin his current job (AX C-1, C-2). He testified he is \u201cnot very attached\u201d to the house, and \nhe and his family would leave it if relations between the U.S. and Japan made it \nnecessary (Tr. 50). He is aware that the U.S. is transferring forces from Okinawa to \nGuam. He testified he will go wherever his employer asks him to go (Tr. 49).  \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts. Japan is a constitutional \nmonarchy with a parliamentary government. It is one of the U.S.\u2019s most important \neconomic partners. Although Japan has some problems with child abuse, trafficking in \npersons, and discrimination against women, ethnic minorities, and foreigners, it has a \ngenerally good human rights record. The crime rate in Japan is lower than it is in the \nU.S., and there is no significant terrorist activity. The military alliance of the U.S. and \nJapan is the cornerstone of U.S. security interests in Asia and regional stability. U.S. \nand Japanese military forces routinely conduct joint exercises. Japan provides facilities, \nfinancial support, and material support to U.S. forwarded-deployed forces. Japan grants \nbase rights on its territory in return for a U.S. promise to protect Japan\u2019s security. Japan \nhas provided extensive logistical support to U.S. operations in Afghanistan, and it has \nsupported the U.S. operations in Iraq. Over 100 countries, including allies like Japan, \nhave been known to collect sensitive information and technology in the U.S. In its \nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage \nfor 2000, the National Counterintelligence Center included a survey of \u201cnearly a dozen\u201d \nselected Fortune 500 companies, concluding that Japan was among the seven most \nactive collectors of U.S. economic and technological information. Japan has not been \nlisted by name in any subsequent updates by the Office of the National \nCounterintelligence Executive.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse and two children are dual citizens of Japan \nand the U.S. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); his father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Japan \nand retired as a colonel from the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \nhis mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Japan (SOR \u00b6 1.d); his brother-in-law is a \ncitizen and resident of Japan currently serving as a pilot in the Japanese Self-Defense \nForces (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and he owns a house in Okinawa worth about $515,000 that is \nfinanced by the Bank of Okinawa (SOR \u00b6 1.f1). The evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s \nspouse is a citizen only of Japan and not a dual citizen as alleged.  \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nFour disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, \na disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). Third, a security \nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). Fourth, a security \n                                                          \n1 This subparagraph is incorrectly designated as 1.d in the SOR; it should be 1.f. I have made a \nhandwritten correction to the SOR. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconcern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in \na foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(e). \n \n \nThe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003). A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. \n01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).   \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (d), and (e) all require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. \n \n \nA \u201cheightened risk\u201d is not raised by the nature of the government of Japan, \nbecause it is one of our closest allies and it has a good human rights record. Japanese \nindustries have been known to target sensitive information and technology in the U.S., \nbut many other industrialized countries, including allies, also practice economic and \nindustrial espionage. Although Applicant does not appear to have particular feelings of \naffection for his brother-in-law, he has not rebutted the presumption that he has feelings \nof obligation toward his spouse\u2019s immediate family members. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law \nis an officer in the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, but the military forces of the U.S. and \nJapan work closely together and share information on a regular basis. His brother-in-law \n\n \n8 \n \n \nis a pilot, not an intelligence agent. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is retired from the Japanese \nmilitary, but he is in the business of providing commercial loans and thus is connected \nwith Japanese economic interests. The crime rate in Japan is much lower than in the \nU.S., and there is no evidence of significant terrorism in Okinawa or mainland Japan. \nApplicant has a significant financial investment in his home, but Japan does not have a \nrecord of taking property or using any other coercive measures to obtain information. \n \nNevertheless, after considering the relatively low level risk involved in the term \n\u201cheightened risk,\u201d and the relatively low level of proof required to raise a disqualifying \ncondition, i.e., more than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance, I \nconclude the government has met its burden of raising the concerns based on \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (d), and (e). The \u201cheightened risk\u201d also raises the \npotential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b), shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). In light of the nature of the Japanese government and its \nrelationships with the U.S., I am satisfied it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of having to chose between the interests of the U.S. government and the \nJapanese government, but I am not satisfied of the unlikelihood that he might be placed \nin the position of having to chose between the interests of the U.S. and his spouse or in-\nlaws. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to his spouse and her family is not \u201cminimal,\u201d but his loyalties to the \nU.S. and the U.S. Marines he supports are deep and longstanding. His entire world, \nexcept for his immediate family, is centered on the Marines in Okinawa. His social life is \namong the military community, and he has virtually no social or professional life outside \nof his relationship with the Marines. I conclude this mitigating condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nThis presumption does not apply to Applicant\u2019s in-laws, because they are not immediate \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfamily members as the term is used in the adjudicative guidelines. Applicant\u2019s contacts \nwith his brother-in-law are infrequent and limited to exchange of pleasantries. On the \nother hand, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his mother-in-law and father-in-law are not \ninfrequent. As he described it, they are active grandparents. Even though there is a \nlanguage barrier, contacts are mutually motivated by familial affection. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n8(c) is applicable to Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, but not to his father-in-law and mother-in-\nlaw.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from financial interests can be mitigated if \u201cthe value or \nroutine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they \nare unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(f). Applicant\u2019s investment in his home is \nsubstantial, and its loss would cause him and his family considerable hardship, even \nthough he is satisfied he could absorb such a loss. The likelihood that Japan would use \nhis home to manipulate or pressure him is virtually nil, but the substantial value of his \nproperty makes this mitigating condition inapplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant took off his Marine uniform more than eight years ago, but he has \nnever left the Marine Corps. He is mentally and emotionally still a Marine. He is totally \ndedicated to his mission and the interests of the U.S. He has held a clearance \ncontinuously for more than 12 years without incident. He was sincere, candid, and \npersuasive at the hearing. He has thoughtfully considered the financial impact of leaving \nJapan if it were necessary, and he knows that redeployment of U.S. forces could require \nhim and his family to leave Japan. His spouse and in-laws are not involved in politics or \n\n \n10 \n \n \nassociated with Japanese intelligence agencies or directly involved in high technology \nbusinesses. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on December 6, 2006. On \nJuly 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines E and J. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 3, 2009; answered it on August 17, 2009; \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nAugust 24, 2009. On September 10, 2009, DOHA sent Applicant a supplemental \nstatement of reasons (captioned as an amendment), citing security concerns under \nGuideline F. Applicant responded by facsimile transmission on September 29, 2009. \n \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on October 16, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on October 20, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October \n27, 2009, scheduling the hearing for November 17, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until December 4, 2009, to \npermit Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX C, \nD, and E, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX \nC, D, and E is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on November 25, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 3.b. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old drawing clerk employed by a defense contractor since \nJuly 2006. He is responsible for handling ship drawings. He graduated from high school \nin June 1998, and then attended college from August 1998 until December 2004 on a \nfootball scholarship. He did not receive a degree. After four years his scholarship \nended, and he could not afford to complete his degree requirements (Tr. 45). He \nrecently was accepted at a local university, where he intends to earn the 18 credit hours \nhe needs to obtain a degree (Tr. 42-43). He underwent a background check as a \ncondition of employment in an airport mailroom in June 2000, but he has never held a \nsecurity clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in July 2009, and he has a son who was born in August \n2009 (Tr. 40-41). His spouse is an industrial engineer working at a naval base (Tr. 41).  \n \n \nIn July 2002, while in college, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nmaintaining a dwelling place for the sale of marijuana, possession of marijuana, and \nselling or delivering marijuana, all felonies (GX 8 at 4). Applicant told a security \ninvestigator that his arrest occurred as a result of sharing an apartment with two \nroommates, one of whom was selling marijuana. The apartment lease was in \nApplicant\u2019s name, but his roommates contributed to the rent (Tr. 89-91). His arrest \noccurred after his two roommates moved out of the apartment and was based on \ninformation from an undercover police officer who had purchased marijuana from \nApplicant\u2019s roommate. Applicant admitted to a security investigator that he was present \nin the apartment when his roommate sold the marijuana to the undercover police officer \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(GX 4 at 4). At the hearing, he testified that he witnessed two or three other marijuana \nsales (Tr. 86). He has had no contact with his marijuana-selling former roommate since \n2002 (Tr. 94). \n \nApplicant pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of selling marijuana, on the \nadvice of his attorney, and in accordance with a plea agreement. The other charges \nwere dismissed. He was placed on unsupervised probation for six months, fined about \n$300, required to perform 75 hours of community service, and required to attend alcohol \nand drug awareness classes. He paid the fine, served his community service, attended \nthe classes, and completed his probation (GX 2 at 5). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant insisted that he was not guilty of selling marijuana. He \ntestified he trusted his lawyer, who assured him that if he pleaded guilty to a \nmisdemeanor the conviction would be stricken from his record after he completed his \ncommunity service (Tr. 95-96).  \n \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed \nweapon and possession of marijuana. He told a security investigator he was driving his \nroommate\u2019s car when he was stopped by police while leaving a known drug-trafficking \narea. When he was stopped, he removed his pistol from the glove box and placed it in \nplain view. The police found a small quantity of marijuana in the trunk. Applicant told the \ninvestigator that all charges were dismissed and his pistol was returned to him (GX 2 at \n6). The court records reflect that Applicant appeared in court pro se, pleaded not guilty \nto the marijuana charge and was acquitted. The court records also reflect that he \npleaded guilty to the weapon offense. Two \u201cfindings\u201d boxes are checked, one indicating \nhe was convicted of the weapon offense and one indicating he was acquitted. His pistol, \nwhich was properly registered, was returned to him (GX 7). \n \nAlthough the court records reflect that Applicant pleaded guilty to the weapon \noffense in 2004, he testified at the hearing that he did not plead guilty. He testified he \ndid not understand why his weapon would have been returned to him if he had pleaded \nguilty and had been convicted (Tr. 102, 104, 109). \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application in December 2006, \nhe disclosed an arrest for carrying a concealed weapon in August 2000, but he did not \ndisclose his arrest for carrying a concealed weapon in June 2004. At the hearing, he \ntestified he had only one weapon-related arrest and that it occurred in 2004. He testified \nthat the date of his arrest reflected on his security clearance application was incorrect, \nas a result of his negligence (Tr. 97, 101).  \n \nOn the same security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question \n23d, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to \nalcohol or drugs. He did not disclose the marijuana-related charges in 2002 and 2004. \nHe testified he did not disclose the charges and conviction in 2002 because his lawyer \ninformed him that they would not be on his record (Tr. 97-98), but he offered no \n\n \n4 \n \n \nexplanation for not disclosing that he was charged with possession of marijuana in \n2004. \n \nApplicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24a, asking if he had ever illegally used \nany controlled substance since the age of 16 or in the last seven years. On October 30, \n2008, he executed a sworn affidavit containing the substance of an interview with a \nsecurity investigator (GX 4 at 6-8). The affidavit was handwritten by the investigator (Tr. \n114). Applicant initialed each page, and he signed and swore to its contents on the last \npage. The affidavit includes the following description of his previous marijuana use: \n \nSince I was 15 or 16 years old I smoked marijuana on the \nweekends or at parties socially. I would spend about $40.00/month for my \nmarijuana social usage. I have never sold, transported or distributed \nmarijuana or any other illegal drug. Since the visit & finger printing at the \n[redacted] Police States in 2002 I have not used marijuana, bought \nmarijuana or any other illegal substance. I had stopped smoking marijuana \neven before going to court in 2002 and pleading guilty. I have not and will \nnot smoke marijuana or any other drug in the present or future. \n.     .     . \nSince 2002 I realized my immaturity with smoking marijuana and \nthe type of friends, roommates and company I kept. I have since grown \nup, went on the play football, professionally and surrounded myself with \nbetter people and friends. There is no drug usage or selling in my current \nor future life.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s affidavit was the basis for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c that he falsified \nhis security clearance application by deliberately failing to disclose marijuana use within \nthe last seven years of submitting the application. At the hearing, he testified the \naffidavit summarized the results of several interviews. He denied telling the investigators \nthat he used marijuana until 2002. He testified that he stopped using marijuana while he \nwas in middle school. He stated that he did not use it in high school and college, \nbecause it was inconsistent with being a good athlete and he was subject to random \ndrug tests (Tr. 125-28). \n \n \nApplicant also disputed the implication in the affidavit that he used marijuana \nregularly. He testified he meant to say only that he used marijuana more than once (Tr. \n124-25). \n \nIn response to questions on his security clearance application about financial \ndelinquencies, Applicant disclosed a $600 student loan that had been more than 180 \ndays delinquent, but he stated on his application that the loan was satisfied. His credit \nreport dated September 10, 2009, reflected an unpaid medical bill for $143, with last \nactivity in July 2006, and numerous student loans referred for collection and totaling \nabout $40,134 (GX 10). He admitted he owed the medical bill. In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories in May 2008, he responded that he had called the doctor\u2019s office and set \na date to pay the bill in full. He testified that the bill is from his regular doctor, but as of \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe date of the hearing the bill remained unpaid, because he had not had an occasion to \nvisit his doctor (Tr. 57).  \n \n \nApplicant testified the student loans were obtained by his parents on his behalf. \nInitially, he did not make any payments on the loans because he thought it was unfair \nfor his parents to expect him to make payments on a loan they obtained for him (Tr. 33). \nHe testified he eventually made a $50 payment because his mother was \u201con [his] back.\u201d \nAfter the hearing, he presented documentary evidence of a $40.19 payment in May \n2008, followed by regular payments from December 2008 through August 2009. As of \nOctober 31, 2009, his balance was $36,095 (Tr. 64; AX D at 2). He testified his monthly \npayments on the student loans are deducted automatically from his checking account \n(Tr. 62). His student loan payments are now current. He testified he has requested that \npayments be deferred for two months, and he will then continue making payments of \n$175 per month (Tr. 34). His employer will reimburse him for his college expenses when \nhe returns to school (Tr. 71-72). \n \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant was working aboard an aircraft carrier and had an \ninterim confidential clearance. His supervisor instructed him to retrieve ship\u2019s drawings \nfrom a classified vault, not realizing that he was not cleared to enter that vault. Applicant \nretrieved the drawings as ordered. A subsequent investigation determined that no \nclassified material was lost or unaccounted for, but the possibility of compromise could \nnot be ruled out. Applicant was required to undergo additional security training, but he \nwas not otherwise disciplined. The record does not reflect what action, if any, was taken \nagainst his supervisor (GX 9). \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse recently bought a house for about $205,000, on which \nthe monthly payments are about $1,500 (Tr. 42). According to a budget he submitted \nafter the hearing, he and his spouse have a total net monthly income of about $4,400 \nand expenses of $3,628, leaving a net remainder of about $872 (AX E). The budget \ndoes not specifically reflect any payments on the student loans.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s two arrests in July 2002 and June 2004 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b). It also alleges he falsified his security clearance application by deliberately \nfailing to disclose a firearms offense, drug-related charges in July 2002 and June 2004,  \nmarijuana use, and a conviction of selling marijuana in 2002 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f). Finally, it \n\n \n7 \n \n \nalleges that he entered a restricted area in February 2007 without the requisite security \nclearance (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe disqualifying condition relevant to the allegations of falsification is AG \u00b6 16(a) \n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire). When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, \nthe government has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not \nprove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant was a mature, well-educated adult when he submitted his security \nclearance application, but he had no previous experience with the security clearance \nprocess. He admitted that he was negligent in completing the form, but negligence does \nnot constitute deliberate falsification. I am satisfied that his response to question 23b, \nasking about firearms offenses, was the product of negligence. The court records reflect \nonly one firearms offense, and it occurred in 2004, not 2000 as reported by Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to his answer to question 23b. \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23d, asking about drug-related charges, and \nhe did not disclose his arrests in July 2002 and June 2004. His explanation for not \ndisclosing the arrest and conviction in 2002 was that he relied on his attorney\u2019s \nassurance that they would be stricken from his record. He did not explain why he did not \ndisclose that he had been charged with possession of marijuana in 2004. He did not \nexplain why he did not follow the guidance on the application to report charges as well \nas convictions and to \u201creport information regardless of whether the record in your case \nhas been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record.\u201d I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nraised by his answer to question 23d. \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24, asking if he had illegally used any \ncontrolled substance during the seven years preceding his application. He disputed the \naccuracy of an affidavit suggesting that he continued to use marijuana until 2002, even \nthough he initialed, signed, and swore to the accuracy of the affidavit. After considering \nall the evidence and observing Applicant\u2019s demeanor at the hearing, I am satisfied that \nhe did not intend to admit regularly using marijuana until 2002. I am also satisfied that \nhe refrained from using it while playing college football and thereafter. His failure to \nchallenge the accuracy of the affidavit when he swore to it is consistent with his \n\n \n8 \n \n \nnegligent execution of his security clearance application, as demonstrated by his \nincorrect response to question 23b and inaccurate reporting of his student loans. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to his answer to question 24. \n \n \nThe disqualifying conditions relevant to Applicant\u2019s arrests and convictions in July \n2002 and June 2004 and his security violation in February 2007 are as follows: \nAG 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; \nAG 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as  . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and \nAG 16(g): association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \nThe evidence reflects that Applicant used marijuana in high school, that he \ntolerated his college roommate\u2019s drug dealing in his house, that he pleaded guilty to \nselling marijuana in July 2002, that he was convicted of a concealed weapon offense in \nJune 2004, and that he was involved in a security violation in February 2007. I am \nsatisfied that the security violation was inadvertent and the product of Applicant\u2019s \ncompliant personality and his supervisor\u2019s negligence. However, the remaining conduct \nis sufficient to raise all the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s association with persons involved in criminal activity, i.e., his drug-\ndealing roommate, was not specifically alleged in the SOR. I have considered this \nconduct for the limited purpose of deciding which adjudicative guidelines are applicable; \nto evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider \nwhether Applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and as part of my whole-\n\n \n9 \n \n \nperson analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations \nomitted). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), (c), (d), (e), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nAn applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns raised by falsification of a security clearance questionnaire \nmay be mitigated if \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(a). Applicant submitted the questionnaire in December 2006. He did not disclose his \nJuly 2002 arrest and conviction or correct the date of his concealed weapon offense \nuntil he was interviewed by a security investigator and confronted with the evidence in \nAugust 2007. This mitigating condition is not established. \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Several of \nApplicant\u2019s offenses were serious. He was arrested for felonies in 2002 and 2004, and \nhis falsification of his security questionnaire was a felony, as discussed below under \nGuideline J. His misconduct was not infrequent, and it did not occur under unique \ncircumstances.  \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on \nwhether the conduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when \nconduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the evidence. If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest was in June 2004. The security violation in February 2007 \nwas inadvertent and largely the fault of his supervisor. Since his arrest for carrying a \nconcealed weapon, he has married, become a father, and bought a home. He is \nfinancially secure. On the other hand, he has allowed his student loans to become \ndelinquent, falsified his security clearance questionnaire, and ignored a financial \nobligation to his doctor. After considering all the evidence, I am not satisfied that he has \ndemonstrated reform or rehabilitation. Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not \nestablished. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). This mitigating condition is established for \nApplicant\u2019s drug-related conduct, but not the weapon offense or his falsifications. He \ncompleted the court-ordered counseling, no longer associates with drug dealers, and \ndoes not use illegal drugs. \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). \nThe record does not reflect the extent to which Applicant has disclosed his criminal \nrecord to supervisors, coworkers, and family. His failure to fully disclose it on his \nsecurity clearance application suggests less than full disclosure. I conclude this \nmitigating condition is not established. \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cassociation with persons involved \nin criminal activity has ceased.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). This mitigating condition is established \nbecause Applicant has no contact with his former roommate who sold drugs. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nParagraph 2.a of the SOR cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as \ncriminal conduct. Paragraph 2.b cross-alleges the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c-1.f \nas felonies in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J. Applicant\u2019s arrests and convictions in July 2002 \nand June 2004, and his false answer to question 23d on his security questionnaire are \nsufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c), shifting the burden \nto Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Security concerns also may \nbe mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). For the reasons set out above in my discussion of Guideline \nE, I conclude that neither of these mitigating conditions is established. None of the other \nenumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are applicable. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges unresolved student loans totaling about $40,134 (SOR \u00b6 3.a) \nand a delinquent medical bill for $143 (SOR \u00b6 3.b). The concern under this guideline is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant allowed his student loans to become \ndelinquent because he disagreed with his family about his obligation to pay them. It also \nshows that he owes his doctor $143 and has repeatedly promised to pay the debt, but \nhe had not done so by the time the record closed.  \n \nApplicant apparently is financially secure. He was unwilling to repay his student \nloans until he was cajoled into paying them by his mother in May 2008. He has simply \nneglected to pay his doctor bill. His conduct raises two disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s debts are \nrecent and one remains unresolved. Only two debts are involved. They did not arise \nunder circumstances making them unlikely to recur. The student loans apparently are \ncurrent, thereby reducing Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or the temptation to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. The small amount involved in the medical bill \n($143) is not likely to make him vulnerable to pressure or to engage in illegal acts, but \n\n \n12 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s disregard of his obligation to pay it casts doubt on his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). This mitigating condition is not applicable \nbecause there is no evidence that the debts arose because of conditions lbeyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not applicable because there is no evidence of financial \ncounseling and the medical debt is not resolved. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). This mitigating condition is established for \nApplicant\u2019s student loans but not for the medical debt. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). This \nmitigating condition is not applicable because Applicant has admitted the debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, J, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is a mature, well-educated \nadult. He made some bad decisions in college and early adulthood. He pleaded guilty in \nJuly 2002 because he was concerned about his criminal record, and his concern carried \nover to his falsification of his security clearance application. He demonstrated a lack of a \nsense of obligation regarding his student loans and the medical bill. He may have \nturned the corner with his recent marriage and fatherhood, but it is too soon to \ndetermine whether he has left his irresponsible lifestyle behind. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, J, \nand F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct, criminal \nconduct, and financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

No payment has been made on these obligations nor has a \nrepayment plan been established. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMay 26, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on December 31, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn February 2, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated March 10, 2009. The FORM \ncontained 10 attachments. On March 17, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, \nalong with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nResponses to the FORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on April 16, 2009. As of May 15, 2009, no response had been \nreceived. On May 15, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the factual allegations of the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough \nreview of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old security guard who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since November 2005, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nIn June 2001, Applicant was laid off by his employer of seven years where he \nhad worked as a manufacturing technician, engineering technician, manufacturing \nsupervisor, purchasing agent and systems administrator. (Item 5) From July 2001 until \nDecember 2001, Applicant was unemployed. His yearly income decreased from \n$40,000 to $20,000 when he obtained a job as a software technician during tax season. \nFrom April 2002 until August 2004, Applicant was again unemployed. (Item 5) \n \nApplicant moved from his two bedroom apartment to a friend\u2019s couch. His Ford \npick-up, which he had purchased just prior being laid off, was repossessed. His goods \nwere placed in storage and later sold to pay past due rent on the storage unit. \nApplicant\u2019s depression, which was first diagnosed when Applicant was in his 20\u2019s, \nintensified during this period. Applicant returned to school which increased his financial \nobligations. (Item 6, 7) In August 2004, Applicant started working at a temporary \nemployment agency until November 2005 when he started at his current job. (Item 5)  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 20, 2006 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), Applicant lists an October 2003 vehicle repossession with a debt of \n$8,550 remaining to be paid. As of August 2008, when Applicant completed the written \ninterrogatories (Item 6), he stated his monthly disposable income (gross income less \nexpenses) was $350. Applicant pays approximately $250 per month on his student \nloans. (Item 6)  \n \n\n \n \n \n3\nBeing a student and unemployed caused Applicant\u2019s debts to become \ndelinquent. (Item 7) Applicant admits to owing the six past due obligations, which have \nbeen placed for collection, listed in SOR. (Item 4) None of the debts, which total \napproximately $21,000, have been paid nor is there evidence of payments being made \non these debts. The first debt of $14525 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was the repossessed pick-up truck \npreviously discussed. In April 2001, Applicant had obtained the approximately $31,000 \nauto loan. (Item 9, page C-1) The $340 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) is a collection agency \nattempting to collect a past due telephone bill. \n \n \nThe $2,954 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was a national credit card account opened in \nFebruary 1995, which has been charged off. The $330 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) is a collection \nagency attempting to collect a different past due telephone bill. The last two accounts \nare the same collection agency attempting to collect for two different national \ndepartment store accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.e, $2,044 and SOR \u00b6 1.f, $1,190). \n  \n \nIn March 2008, when Applicant completed an affidavit (Item 7), he stated he \nwould contact his creditors and start paying back his past due debts. He also stated he \nwould set up a payment schedule for some of the debt. Applicant referenced six of the \nseven SOR debts in his affidavit. No evidence of payment has been received. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n \n \n4\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his \ninterview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR \nresponse, and his response to interrogatories. Throughout this process, he had \nadmitted responsibility for his delinquent debs, totaling about $21,000. He has provided \ninsufficient documentation to show significant progress towards resolving his debts. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the debts were incurred a while ago, but because they remain \nunpaid, the debts are recent and numerous. He was laid off from an employer he had \nbeen with for seven years. It is difficult to say if being laid off is an event which occurred \nunder such a circumstance that it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) has limited \napplicability.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by his \nperiods of unemployment. In June 2001, he was laid off from his job of seven years. \nFrom July 2001 until December 2001, Applicant was unemployed. His yearly income \ndecreased from $40,000 to $20,000. From April 2002 until August 2004, Applicant was \nagain unemployed. A couple of short-term jobs followed. In November 2005, he \nobtained his current job. AG & 20(b) has some applicability since his financial problems \nwere largely beyond his control. Applicant must act responsibility under the \n\n \n \n \n6\ncircumstances and since being employed with his current job, there is no showing of \npayments being made.  \n \nAG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not apply. There is no indication there has been \nfinancial counseling or the financial problems are under control. None of the SOR debts \nhave been paid nor is there a repayment plan in place. Applicant has initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay his student loans, but his student loans are not debts of concern \nlisted in the SOR.  \n \n \nAG & 20(e) does not apply because there is no evidence Applicant disputes the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debts or has provided documented proof to substantiate a \ndispute.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were \ncontributed to by his unemployment and educational expenses. However, he has been \ngainfully employed for three and a half years and no payment on the debts has been \nshown. It is noted that two of the debts each total less than $350 and even these debts \nhave not been paid.  \n \nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am \nunable to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or form a positive determination as to his \ntruthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and \nhonest. Even if I found for him in these matters, there is no evidence of payment on the \ndelinquent debts.  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. However, a clearance at \nthis time is not warranted.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Consideration: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Borgstrom, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 14, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on May 25, 2007.  On October 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 5, 2008, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on January 8, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\n\n2\nFORM on January 12, 2009, and he submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on March 24, 2009.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 45 years old and married with two adult children.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Technician D, and is applying for a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph1 (Guideline I - Psychological Conditions).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his emotional, mental\nand personality conditions can impair his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness and his\nability to properly protect classified information.  \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  Applicant served in the United States Navy from May 1983 until September\n1989.  From December 1986 until February 1987, Applicant attended training in Air\nTraffic Control Radar Maintenance, and received a certification of completion.  Since\nFebruary 1993, he has been employed by a defense contractor.  Applicant was granted\na Secret security clearance by the Department of Defense in December 1999, however\nthis clearance was suspended in January 2007 due to the mental heath condition\ndescribed below.  \nOn January 14, 2007, the Applicant\u2019s wife called the police because her husband\nwho was threatening to harm himself and who exhibited an altered state of mind.  The\nApplicant was at home consuming a couple of alcoholic drinks, when he went to the\nbathroom and learned that his wife had taken the prescription drug Ambien with her to\ntheir daughter\u2019s house in Syracuse, where she was visiting at the time.  Hospital\nmedical records indicate that the Applicant became upset with his wife for taking the\nAmbien, that he telephoned her and told her that he just \u201cbled to death\u201d.  His wife had\ntaken the Ambien with her due to her fear that the Applicant would overdose on the\ndrug.  \nThe Applicant was taken to the a Hospital Emergency Room in the custody of the\nlocal police department.  Applicant was admitted for a physical and psychiatric\nevaluation, and initially refused a CT scan ordered by a physician in the Emergency\nRoom.  (Government Exhibit 5). \nThe Psychiatric Discharge Summary from the hospital states that according to\nthe Applicant\u2019s wife, since June 2006, the Applicant had been increasingly paranoid with\nthe belief that people were following him in his town and that he was being investigated\n\n3\nby the Government.  He referred to people in the community as puppets and started e-\nmailing his time sheets to himself out of paranoid belief that people at his job were trying\nto get rid of him.  In addition, he believed people at his place of work and his neighbors\nwere making an inordinate amount of noise.  He was also afraid that people were trying\nto steal his identity.  His wife stated that he had gone so far as to hit people in the\nmarket with his shopping cart out of the belief that they pose him some harm.  Other\nparanoid beliefs of the Applicant are described in the medical records.  (Government\nExhibit 5).  \nThe psychiatrist who conducted the mental health examination of the Applicant at\nthe hospital concluded that the Applicant had experienced multiple delusions in his\nhistory and that he exhibited poor insight and judgment.  Applicant was prescribed the\npsychiatric medication, Risperdal, to target Applicant\u2019s psychoses.  The doctor\ndiagnosed the Applicant with Delusional Disorder and Psychosis Not Otherwise\nSpecified.  Applicant was discharged from the hospital on January 16, 2007, with the\nrecommendation that he take his prescribed medication on a daily basis and that he\nfollow up with mental health counseling.  (Government Exhibit 5).  Shortly after being\ndischarged, the Applicant dispensed with using his Risperdal.  (Government Exhibit 4).  \nOn September 23, 2008, Applicant received a psychological evaluation from a\nClinical and Neuropsychologist.  The Applicant was given the Minnesota Multiphasic\nPersonality Inventory (MMPI) examination which demonstrated that the Applicant\nexhibited, \u201cstrong paranoia\u201d with a score of 95.  The psychologist noted that any score\nabove 65 is considered in the \u201cpathological range.\u201d  The Applicant was diagnosed with\nsuffering from DSM-IV-TR Axis II 301, \u201dParanoid Personality Disorder.\u201d  This is a\npervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are interpreted\nas malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.  He\nfurther states that, \u201cIt is unfortunately of a continuing nature.  It has been going on for a\nnumber of years.  It seems to get worse and the client is clearly entrenched in his\nbeliefs that he is a target in a conspiracy by his family, his friends, and his fellow\nemployees.  He also believes that the government is watching him and tracking his\nmovements and they are out to destroy him\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 4).      \nAs to whether the Applicant\u2019s illness affects his work: The doctor noted that the\nApplicant\u2019s psychological condition is affecting him both at home and at work.\n\u201cApplicant continued to suffer anxiety attacks, and he believed that his sister, wife and\nson are now all involved in the plots against him.  It was also noted that the Applicant\nquickly dispensed of the psychiatric medication that was prescribed to him for daily\nuse\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 4).\nAs to whether the Applicant is in remission: The evaluation noted that the illness\nand paranoia are by no means in remission and are active and full-blown at the present\ntime.  \u201cHe is not taking any medication that is deconfusional and would be considered\nan anti-psychotic.  He is not utilizing the mental health center as suggested when he\nwas released from the hospital\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 4).\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nGuideline I - (Psychological Conditions)\n27. The Concern.  Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.  A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not\nrequired for there to be a concern under this guideline.  A duly qualified mental health\nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to\nand approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially\ndisqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline.  No negative inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raise solely on the basis of seeking\nmental health counseling.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n28(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to\nemotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior.\n28(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual\nhas a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness;\n28(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a diagnosed\nemotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g. failure to take prescribed medication.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n\n5\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline I (Psychological\nConditions) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between\nApplicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\n\n6\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's questionable psychological conditions has a\ndirect and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  \nIn 2007, the Applicant was diagnosed with Delusional Disorder and a Psychosis\nNot Otherwise Specified, and most recently in 2008, less than a year ago, with Paranoid\nPersonality Disorder.  Two competent mental health professionals have evaluated the\nApplicant\u2019s mental condition and have diagnosed a mental disorder.  The question to be\naddressed now is whether the Applicant has emotional, mental or personality disorders\nwhich can cause a significant defect in the individual\u2019s psychological, social, and\noccupational functioning that may adversely affect the individual\u2019s ability to properly\nsafeguard classified information.  Clearly the Applicant\u2019s mental condition poses a\nsecurity risk.  A psychiatrist and psychologist indicate that the nature of the Applicant\u2019s\nillness is one that exhibits distorted judgment and an altered mental state.  Applicant\u2019s\nillness and paranoia are not in remission, but are full blown.  Furthermore, he is not\ntaking any medication to help his mental state nor is he utilizing the recommended\nmental heath counseling.  The nature of the illness is continuing and there is no positive\noutlook at this time.  Considering this evidence in totality, the Applicant\u2019s mental\ncondition demonstrates an emotional, mental, and personality condition that can impair\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness and can adversely affect his ability to protect\nclassified information.  \nUnder Guideline I, Psychological Conditions, Disqualifying Conditions 28(a)\nbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness that\nis not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to emotionally\nunstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior, 28(b) an\nopinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition\nnot covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness and, 28(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to\na diagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g. failure to take prescribed\nmedication apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nThere has been no evidence presented in mitigation significant to override the\nApplicant\u2019s heavy burden in this case.  Applicant has not met his burden of\n\n7\ndemonstrating that his psychological condition does not raise a security concern, and\nGuideline I is found against the Applicant.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his psychological condition and the impact that it can have on his\nability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn June 4, 2008, applicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 17, 2008. Applicant did not submit a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2008. Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\nApplicant\u2019s security questionnaire identifies one child. However, in his response to the SOR, he referred\n1\nto his \u201cchildren.\u201d\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born in South Korea. When he was still a minor, his parents\nseparated and he moved to the United States with his father. Applicant, his father, and\nhis sister became United States citizens in 1990 or 1991.\nApplicant served in the United States Army for approximately six years. He has\nworked for the same defense contractor since he received his honorable discharge in\n2002. He has been working in South Korea for an unknown period of time.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, to whom he has been married since 2004, was born in South\nKorea. She lives in the United States, but is a citizen of Korea. They have at least one\nchild who was born in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s mother, mother-in-law and father-\n1\nin-law are Korean citizens residing in Korea. In his response to the SOR, applicant\nstated he \u201ckeep[s] in touch\u201d with his mother.\nThe Government offered a number of official United States publications with the\nFORM that provide relevant facts about South Korea. The Government requested that\nthese documents be admitted into evidence. I have admitted the documents into\nevidence, and I take administrative notice of the following facts found therein:\nSouth Korea is a highly developed, stable, democratic republic with powers\nshared between the president and the legislature. Despite the friendly relations between\nthe two countries, South Korea intelligence agencies are some of the most active\ncollectors of sensitive U.S. information and technology. In 1997, a civilian employee of\nthe U.S. Navy pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to Obtain National Defense Information after\nhe was caught providing U.S. classified information to a South Korean military attache.\nCivil penalties have been imposed on numerous U.S. companies for illegal exporting\nmilitary-related products to South Korea.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\n\n3\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Lastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct,\n\n4\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country\u201d\nmay be disqualifying.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of South Korea. There is a rebuttable\npresumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, immediate family\nmembers such as a mother. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother, and his residence\nin South Korea, leaves applicant potentially vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or\ncoercion by the South Korean government. These facts raise concerns under all three\ndisqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. As noted above,\napplicant has the burden to provide evidence that supports application of mitigating\nfactors. In this case, applicant failed to provide sufficient credible evidence that it is\nunlikely he would be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of\nSouth Korea and the interests of the United States, or that he is not vulnerable to a\nconflict of interest.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2.a:\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2.c., the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\n\n5\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born in South Korea. After his parents separated, he moved to the\nUnited States with his father, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1991. He served honorably in\nthe United States military and has worked for his defense contractor employer since\n2002. These are facts in his favor. Working against applicant are the facts that his\nmother, to whom he has ties of affection, is a citizen and resident of South Korea; his\nwife is a citizen of South Korea; his mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of South Korea; and he is currently living in South Korea. These facts create a\nheightened risk of pressure, coercion, or exploitation.\nApplicant may very well have been able to overcome the Government\u2019s evidence\nand establish that it is clearly consistent with the national interest for him to retain his\nsecurity clearance if he had been able to clear up some basic matters, such as (1) why\nhis wife did not apply for U.S. citizenship, (2) what is the exact relationship with his\nmother, and (3) how long has he been working in South Korea and when is he due to\nreturn, if ever. Unfortunately, by requesting a decision without a hearing, and then failing\nto offer documentary evidence that cleared up these and other issues, I have no choice\nbut to conclude applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under Guideline B.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nGuideline B:AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c: Against applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 28, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

He separated with an honorable discharge at the grade of E-4. \n(Tr at 74; Gov 1, sections 11, 16.) After his separation from active duty, Applicant joined \nthe National Guard. He and a friend from the Air Force opened a landscaping business \nin March 2001. The business closed down in late 2002. At around the same time, \nApplicant was recalled to active duty full-time by the Guard. He served on active duty  \nfrom January 2003 to May 2005.  His business partner disappeared, leaving Applicant \nresponsible for much of the business expenses since the accounts were in his name. \n(Tr at 21-22, 73-76.)  Applicant states the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.l, 1.j, 1.k, \n1.l, and 1.n were related to his failed landscaping business. (Tr at 24-25, 40-42, 46-47; \nGov 2.) \n  \nApplicant entered into a loan rehabilitation plan for the student loan accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He agreed to pay $146 per month beginning in \nJune 2008. After he makes seven payments, they will discuss consolidation with him. \n(Tr at 23-24, 48.) \n \nApplicant disputes the debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.q. The debt was for on-line college \ncourses that Applicant took in 2006. He claims the university is charging him for two \nsemesters as opposed to one semester. Applicant only attended one semester and \nclaims he notified the university. He has not paid the university the money owed for the \nsemester that he attended. (Tr at 26-27, 55.)  \n \nApplicant states the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.j, 1.l, 1.n and 1.r are no \nlonger on his credit report. (Tr at 17, 22, 23, 25 -27, 58-59; Gov 2; AE A.) He may have \npaid some of them but thinks they were charged off. He paid taxes related to the \ncharged off accounts. (Tr at 33; 58-59.) He is not sure what the account alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g is but will pay if it is his debt. (Tr at 24; 60.) He states the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h is the next debt to be settled. (Tr at 24, 60.) He claims the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.i, 1.k and 1.m are the same. (Tr at 25, 28.)  \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant attended some financial counseling through the \nVeteran\u2019s Administration. He also learned about credit on the Equifax web-site. He and \nhis wife are in the process of working out a payment plan. She has good credit. (Tr at \n68.) He admits his financial problems are also the result of having a lack of funds to \ncover all of his debts. (Tr at 70-71.)  \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a current budget. His monthly income is \n$5,854.  After expenses, approximately $373 is left over each month. Of the amount, \n$200 is put in savings. (AE D at 4.) Aside from the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, none of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR are included in the \nbudget.    \n \nThe numerous reference letters submitted by Applicant\u2019s current and former co-\nworkers and family friends indicate that he is held in high esteem. (AE C; AE D at 2-3.) \nThe letters describe Applicant as \u201cextremely honest\u201d, \u201cforthright\u201d, \u201creliable\u201d, \n\n \n4 \n \n \n\u201cconscientious,\u201d \u201cprofessional\u201d, and \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d His supervisor indicates that Applicant \ndemonstrates a strong work ethic and has met or exceeded all implementation \ndeadlines imposed upon him by his superiors. He gained the respect and trust of his \npeers as well his supervisor and senior leadership. (AE C at 4.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information.An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) & 19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC & 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since 2002, Applicant has incurred \napproximately $61,721 in delinquent debt. \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems continue. Most of the delinquent debts remain \nunresolved. Aside from the delinquent accounts, Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is \ntight. After monthly expenses, he has only $373 left over each month.     \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to the failure of \nApplicant\u2019s landscaping business in 2002. The next question to be asked is whether the \nApplicant acted responsibly since that time. The record evidence indicates Applicant \ntook little action towards resolving the delinquent accounts which resulted from the \nlandscaping business.  He notes that many of the accounts no longer appear on his \ncredit report but cannot confirm that he resolved any of the accounts. It cannot be \nconcluded that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with regards to resolving \nhis delinquent accounts.     \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant attended financial counseling through the Veteran\u2019s \nAdministration in 2008.  He is starting to take steps to assess his financial situation. \nHowever, his financial problems are not likely to be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, in part, with respect to the student loan \nrehabilitation payment plan Applicant recently entered into pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. However, the first payment was not due until June 2008. He has not \ndeveloped a track record of timely payments towards this debt. In addition, he has not \nmet his burden of proof pertaining to the resolution of the other debts in the SOR.  \nAlthough some of the debts are no longer listed on his credit report, Applicant did not \nprovide proof that he paid off these debts.  \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nreferences, his military service, and his efforts to resolve some of the accounts. \nHowever, a person\u2019s outstanding work history does not mitigate financial irresponsibility. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s business failed in 2002, he took no action to resolve his delinquent \naccounts until recently.  It is too soon to conclude Applicant has mitigated the concerns \nraised under financial considerations. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines B and C\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 3, 2008. She answered the\nSOR in writing on April 3, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nJuly 11, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Security clearance application, dated August 30, 2006) at 1, 8-9.\n1\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 1, 6, 15-20; Tr. 14, 34, 36.\n2\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request on April 8, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on April 22, 2008. DOHA initially assigned this case to another\nadministrative judge on April 29, 2008. For case load management, this case was\nreassigned to me on May 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 9, 2008,\nwhich Applicant received on May 14, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nJune 5, 2008. The government offered two exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received\nand admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness testified on her\nbehalf. She did not submit any exhibits at the hearing. However, I held the record open\nuntil June 16, 2008, for the submission of additional matters.  Applicant timely submitted\nthe evidence, which I marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, without\nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2008, and the\nrecord closed on the same day.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Nigeria. (Tr. at 10-12.) The request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record as\nAdministrative Exhibits I through V. Administrative notice will be limited to matters of\ngeneral knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 28, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, and 2.a-2.d of the SOR, with explanation. She also provided\nadditional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 25 years old, works as an electrical engineer for a Department\nof Defense contractor. She began her employment in July 2006 and completed her\nrequest for a security clearance less than two months later.1\nApplicant was born in the United States (U.S.), while her parents were students\nat a U.S. university. When she was 18 months old, her parents returned to Nigeria, the\nplace of their birth. Applicant indicated on her SF-86 she is also a citizen of Nigeria. She\nremained in Nigeria until 1999 when she returned to the U.S. with her older sister, who\nwas attending college. She completed her high school education in 2000. She\ngraduated from a major U.S. university with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical\nengineering in 2006. She has lived in the U.S. since 1999 and intends to continue living\nin the U.S. She is single with no children.2\n\nTr. 15-18, 45-49.\n3\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 18; Tr.19, 35-37.\n4\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 18-19; Tr.18, 37-42.\n5\nTr. 38-40, 42-44, 48-49.\n6\n3\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Nigeria. They live in\nsouthern Nigeria and are not politically active. Her father works as an electrical engineer\nwith an electric company in Nigeria. Applicant does not know if his employer is a private\ncompany or a government owned company. Her father owns several rental properties,\nand her mother manages the business for him because she is an accountant. Her\nmother worked as a principal for a number of years in her grandfather\u2019s school. In 2005,\nApplicant\u2019s mother decided to open a private high school, which she now operates and\nmanages. Like most schools in Nigeria, the school is funded through tuition and not by\nthe government. The school complies with general educational guidelines and curricula\ndeveloped by the Nigerian government. However, the government is not involved in the\ndat-to-day operations of the school.3\nApplicant and her older sister, who is also a U.S. citizen by birth, came to the\nU.S. in 1999 to attend school. Her older sister continues to reside in the U.S. and they\nlive together. Applicant\u2019s sister attends college part-time while working towards her\nsecond bachelor\u2019s degree and works in the medical profession. Although she also\nclaims dual citizenship, her older sister intends to remain in the U.S. Their father has\nencouraged both to remain in the U.S.4\nApplicant\u2019s brother, who is 23-years-old, is a citizen of and resides in Nigeria. He\nrecently graduated from college with a degree in accounting. He plans to return to\nschool to obtain a masters degree. Her two younger sisters are ages 22 and 17 and are\ncitizens of and reside in Nigeria. Her 22-year-old sister is a  college student, majoring in\naccounting, and her 17-year-old sister just graduated from high school. None of her\nsiblings are married or have children.5\nApplicant generally communicates with her family in Nigeria by telephone. She\noccasionally sends her dad information on cars by e-mail, but does not otherwise use e-\nmail to communicate with her family. She talks with her mother one to two times a\nmonth and her father whenever he is at home. She talks with her brother and 22-year-\nold sister two or three times a year. She talks with her youngest sister about once a\nmonth. To her knowledge, her siblings in Nigeria do not plan to emigrate to the U.S. Her\nparents have not visited the U.S. since their return to Nigeria more than 20 years ago\nand her siblings in Nigeria have never visited the U.S.6\nApplicant obtained her current U.S. passport in 2001, and used this passport and\na Nigerian visa when she traveled to Nigeria for the Christmas holiday in December\n2001. During this trip, Applicant learned that her mother had applied for a Nigerian\npassport on Applicant\u2019s behalf to ease her entry into Nigeria in the future. Applicant\n\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and answers) at I-12, I-16; Tr. 21-22, 26-29, 33, 57-61. \n7\nGE 2, supra note 7, at I-19, I-41; App Ex A (Documents on passport destruction); Tr. 27-30, 61, 63-65.\n8\nTr. 20, 52-59, 68, 70.\n9\nTr. 30.\n10\nTr. 72-74.\n11\n4\nreceived the Nigerian passport before she left Nigeria sometime in January 2002.\nApplicant used her U.S. passport to exit and enter the U.S. and her Nigerian passport to\nenter and exit Nigeria when she traveled for the Christmas holiday in December 2002\nand in the summer of 2006.7\nApplicant\u2019s Nigerian passport expired in January 2007. When she traveled to\nNigeria for the 2007 Christmas holiday, Applicant obtained a single-entry Nigerian visa\nwhich she used along with her U.S. passport for exit from the U.S. and entry into Nigeria\nand return to the U.S. While in Nigeria, her family took a vacation to a neighboring\ncountry, a trip she did not learn about until she arrived in Nigeria. Nigeria allowed her to\nre-enter Nigeria on her expired Nigerian passport, but not on her single entry visa. At\nthe hearing, Applicant expressed a willingness to give up her Nigerian passport, and\nhas done so. She has expressed a willingness to give up her Nigerian citizenship. The\nrecord contains no evidence that by giving up her passport, she renounced her Nigerian\ncitizenship. She does not know how to renounce her Nigerian citizenship, nor does she\nknow when she will travel next to Nigeria.8\nApplicant visits her maternal grandfather when she is in Nigeria, but not her\npaternal grandmother, who lives some distance from the family. She stays with her\nparents when in Nigeria and her siblings are at home during this time. She has one\nuncle and cousins who are citizens and residents of the U. S. She spends all her time\nwith her family when in Nigeria, but not with anyone else as she has no friends in\nNigeria. The Nigerian government has not approached her during her visits, nor has any\nmember of  her family had any problems with the Nigerian government. She does not\ndiscuss her job with her family.9\nApplicant has never voted in a Nigerian election. She does not own property or\nhold any bank accounts in Nigeria. She does not receive any money from the Nigerian\ngovernment for any reason, including education.10\nApplicant\u2019s former first-line supervisor and current section head testified on her\nbehalf. He described her as a hard worker, intelligent, highly motivated, reliable, and a\nperson of integrity. She is an asset to his organization and a person in whom he has\nconfidence and great respect personally. While holding her interim clearance, she did\nnot violate security rules.11\n\nAdministrative Exhibit I (U.S. Department of State, Bureau of African Affairs, Background Note: Nigeria,\n12\ndated April 2008); Administrative Exhibit II (CRS Report for Congress Nigeria: Current Issues, dated January\n2008); Administrative Exhibit V (U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in\nNigeria 2007, dated March 2008).\n5\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Nigeria became an independent\ncountry in 1960. Because of many changes in its governing structure following gaining\nindependence, Nigeria suffers from political instability, economic crisis, ethnic and\nreligious conflict, extreme poverty, lack of law and order, and judicial corruption. IN may\n1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule and is now an emerging democracy with strong\nties to the U.S. The current Nigerian government is focusing on economic reform and is\nsuccessfully \nbuilding \na \nmarket-based \neconomy, \nincluding \nprivatizing \nits\ntelecommunications and petrochemical industries. It is focused on rebuilding its\ninfrastructure, not espionage against the U.S. Nigeria is a key strategic and trading\npartner of the U.S. in Africa. While its human rights record still needs serious\nimprovement, police actions appear to target political activists and criminals.  Crime\nremains a serious problem in certain areas. Muslims live in northern Nigeria, where\nreligious conflict is prevalent, and Christians live in southern Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s family\nlives in southern Nigeria where there is less internal conflict. If they travel, family\nmembers travel to the homes of other family members in the south.  The Nigerian\n12\ngovernment does not support or sponsor terrorism or terrorist organizations, but some\nacts of terrorism have occurred within Nigeria.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n\n7\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(I) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make\nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country.\nSix of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are citizens of and reside in\nNigeria. She maintains a normal personal relationship with these family members.\nThese relationships are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance. The\ngovernment must establish that these family relationships create a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion or would create a\npotential conflict of interest between her obligations to protect sensitive information and\nher desire to help her family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the government of Nigeria.\nSee ISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). Applicant regularly talks with\nher parents. She talks with two of her siblings two or three times a year and her\nyoungest sister on a monthly basis. She visited her family in Nigeria four times between\n2001 and 2007. During these visits, she stayed at her parents home, as did her siblings.\nShe visited her nearby grandfather, but had no other contacts with extended family or\nothers, including government officials during her visit.\nAlthough Nigeria is regarded as friendly to the U.S., the distinction between\nfriendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution. Relations between\nnations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Nevertheless, the nature of\na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members would be at a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\nor would create a potential conflict of interest between her obligations to protect\nsensitive information and her desire to help her family members. The risk is significantly\ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct\nintelligence operations against the U.S. Nigeria is an emerging democracy. Nigeria has\nserious economic, human rights issues, and criminal problems The government of\nNigeria, however, does not support terrorism and the active collection of intelligence or\nproprietary information.\n\nISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-02715 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n13\n8\nApplicant\u2019s family members live in southern Nigeria which is predominately\nChristian. Her family members do not receive and are not dependent upon government\nfunds. Applicant is unaware of any serious problems in the south as a result of politics\nand government policy. While Nigeria has significant Human Rights problems, there is\nlittle risk that the Nigerian government could apply pressure or subject Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers to duress because her family members are neither political activists nor\ncriminals. I do not find a heightened concern exists as to Applicant\u2019s family members in\nNigeria.13\nShould a heightened risk exist, I must consider if Applicant has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns. Under AG \u00b6 8 (a), mitigation is established if  \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), if\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant maintains a normal relationship with her family members. Applicant\nclearly has close ties with her family in Nigeria. However, her family members are not\ninvolved in politics and do not rely on the Nigerian government for any financial support.\nRather, her mother runs a private school and her father works for the electric company.\nThree of her siblings are students in Nigeria and her fourth sibling lives with her in the\nU.S. Given that the U.S. and Nigeria have a strong relationship and the lack of\ncounterintelligence activity by Nigeria, there is little likelihood that the Nigerian\ngovernment would pressure or coerce her family members for information. By living in\nsouthern Nigeria, her family members are less vulnerable to government pressure.\nApplicant has established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a). With her significant connections\nto the U.S., she has also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). Given her regular\ncontacts with family members in Nigeria, AG \u00b6 8(c) is not applicable.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\n\nThe remaining disqualifying conditions are not applicable to this case. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(b) - 10 (e).\n14\n9\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 10, the following conditions could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1)\npossession of a current foreign passport;\n(2)\nmilitary service or a willingness to bear arms\nfor a foreign country;\n(3)\naccepting educational, medical, retirement,\nsocial welfare, or other such benefits from a\nforeign country;\n(4)\nresidence in a foreign country to meet citizenship\nrequirements;\n(5)\nusing foreign citizenship to protect financial. or\nbusiness interests in another country;\n(6)\nseeking or holding political office in a foreign\ncountry; and,\n(7)\nvoting in a foreign election.14\nApplicant is a citizen of the U.S. by birth. Her parents, however, are not U.S.\ncitizens, but citizens of Nigeria. They returned to Nigeria when they completed college\neducation and Applicant was 18 months old. Applicant became a citizen of Nigeria\nbecause of her parents. She lived in Nigeria until she was 16 years old, when she\nreturned to the U.S. In 2002, her mother obtained a Nigerian passport for her, which she\nused to enter and exist Nigeria through January 2008. She has never voted in Nigeria,\nheld political office, served in the military or owned property in Nigeria. She receives no\nfinancial assistance of any type, including educational funds, from the Nigerian\ngovernment. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a) and 10(a)(1) apply. The remaining\ndisqualifying conditions in \u00b6 10(a) do not apply.\n\n10\nUnder AG \u00b6 11, Applicant could mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns\nthrough any of the following:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor; and\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.\nWhen she traveled to Nigeria in December 2007, she used her U.S. passport and\na Nigerian visa to travel between the U.S. Nigeria. The only way Nigeria allowed her to\nenter from a family vacation to nearby country was on her expired Nigerian passport.\nSince this trip, Applicant submitted her expired Nigerian passport to her security officer,\nwho destroyed it. She has expressed a willingness to renounce her Nigerian citizen\nwhich she acquired because of her parents. Outside of holding a Nigerian passport for\nfive years, Applicant has not exercised any other rights of Nigerian citizenship. She\nplans to remain in the U.S. She has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under\n\u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n11\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth,\nwho was raised in Nigeria by her Nigerian parents. While still a high school student, she\nreturned to the U.S. where she completed both high school and college. She has lived\nin the U.S. for nine years and has no intent to return to Nigeria to live. She continues to\nmaintain regular contact with her parents and travels there mainly for the Christmas\nholiday season. Her contacts with her family and her travels to Nigeria have not and do\nnot place her at a heightened risk because the Nigerian government is not a collector of\nintelligence nor a sponsor of terrorism. Nigeria and the U.S. are not economic or military\nrivals. Although crime is a problem in Nigeria, as in the U.S., Applicant and her family\nare not at any greater risk because of the crime. The Nigerian government has\nproblems with human rights violations, but there is no evidence such violations occur\nbecause of a person\u2019s relationship to the U.S. Because of all these reasons and her\nfamily lives in southern Nigeria and are not politically active, they are not at risk for\nproblems from the Nigerian government.\nAs a Nigerian citizen, Applicant held a Nigerian passport, which expired 18\nmonths ago and is destroyed. She has not exercised any other rights of her Nigerian\ncitizenship and is willing to renounce her citizenship. She complies with U.S. laws and is\na model citizen. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising because of her foreign\ninfluence and foreign preference.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge found that Applicant has a delinquent debt of $4,965 arising from his cancellation\nof an apartment lease.  He also found that Applicant has delinquent debts for child support\nobligations for two of his three children.

The Board has also examined the Judge\u2019s whole-person\nanalysis, in which he concluded that Applicant had not established a sufficient track record of fiscal\nresponsibility to justify the award of a security clearance.  This is also sustainable.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United\nStates v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Since May 2007 he has held a second job on \nweekends for which he receives between $200 and $450 every two weeks (Exh. J). He \ntook the second job in an effort to pay the delinquent debts at issue. He is well regarded by \nboth employers for his work (Exhs. K and L).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debts arose from various causes. A summary of the debts and their \nstatus based on testimony reveals the following: \n\n \n3\n \n1. SOR & 1.a. This is for a telephone bill of $390 which has been paid and \nis duplicated at SOR \u00b6 1.i. (Exh. F).  \n \n       \n2. SOR & 1.b. This debt of $4,965 is for cancellation of a multi-year lease on \nan apartment by Applicant from which he moved after a few months. He \ndisputes the amount and is in negotiation with the creditor (Exhs. I and N).  \n \n3. SOR & 1.c. This debt for $3,141 to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService arose when Applicant left the Air Force and had been paid in excess \nof what he should have been. It was originally $4,000 and has now been \nreduced to $2,200 through payroll withdrawals. It should be paid in full by \nJanuary 2009 (Exhs. A and B).  \n \n4. SOR & 1.d. Telephone bill paid in full in October 2007 (Exh. C).   \n \n \n5. SOR & 1.e. Delinquent child support monthly payment to state agency of \n$382 for one child.   \n \n6. SOR & 1.f. Delinquent child support monthly payment to state agency of \n$264 for second child.  The two child support payments are delinquent in the \namount of approximately $9,000. He is now making the payments with an \nadditional $100 a month for each child to resolve the delinquencies. \nDocumentation in support of these obligations was promised by Applicant \nbut not provided even after the close of the record.  \n \n \n \n7. SOR & 1.g. Auto loan of $2,666. This debt and those listed below at 1.h. \nand 1.j. below have been consolidated by credit counselor in May 2008.  \nApplicant is making payments of $240 per month. The debts will be resolved \nin three years at the current payment schedule (Exhs. G and H.).  \n \n8. SOR & 1.h. Debt to Military Star for credit card debt of $5,000. \n \n9. SOR & 1.i. Duplicate of  SOR & 1.a. \n \n \n10. SOR & 1.j. Citibank credit card for $1,231.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge=s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \n\n \n4\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \n\n \n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG \n\u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying. Similarly \nunder AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations may raise security \nconcerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and was unable or \nunwilling to pay the obligations for several years. Thus, the evidence clearly raises these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG & 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. No evidence was \noffered to show these mitigating conditions.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), the security concern also may be mitigating where the conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. No evidence \nhas been offered to show that such facts are applicable.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. While it is not necessary for \nmitigation to apply that all of the delinquent debts be resolved, it is necessary that a \nsignificant portion of the debts be settled or paid. While seven of the ten debts have been \npartially or fully resolved, a large amount of debt is still unresolved in the remaining three. \nThus, I believe this test has not been met despite Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve the issues.  \n \n \nApplicant is fully employed with a combined income from two jobs of over $50,000 \nper annum the past year. While several of the debts in the SOR have been paid and others \nare being paid in an orderly fashion through withholding and consolidation, two of the larger \ndebts are not resolved.  They are the delinquent child support debts for which no evidence \nwas submitted as to status and amount, and the rental debt which, although disputed, is \nstill outstanding. Thus, even when the debts that are paid or consolidated with regular \npayments are mitigated, approximately $14,000 remains unresolved and not fully \nexplained. That amount is over half of the total debts alleged and established of $25,000. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the  \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual=s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \n\n \n6\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.   \n \nApplicant is a young person and is acting responsibly to make certain that he \nprovides support to his three children through child support by working two jobs.  However, \nhe has incurred significant debts over the past years and it is only in the past year that he \nhas taken steps to resolve them. If he keeps on the track he has set for himself, this should \nresolve the issues within the next two to three years. However, at this time it is premature \nto grant him a clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from these financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant \n                             Subparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant \n                       Subparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant \n       Subparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant \n       Subparagraph 1.f.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nAccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_____________________\nCHARLES D.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on March 12, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nJuly 14, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received on April 7, 2008, and she\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 19, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on June 25, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 3, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts for about $26,000 in\ntotal. Her Answer was mixed. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following\nfacts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for\nher current employer since 1987; her position or title is office administrator. A former\nsupervisor has high regard for her \u201csound security practices\u201d and believes she can be\ntrusted with access to classified information (Exhibit A).  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems (including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in\nthe 1990s that is not alleged in the SOR). The delinquent debts in the SOR are\nestablished by the admitted documentary evidence (Exhibits 2\u20134). Her history of\nfinancial problems is extensive. For example, a March 2007 credit report contains\nmultiple accounts with derogatory information (for example, past due, bad debt,\nassigned for collection) as well as 19 accounts in the collections section of the report\n(Exhibit 3). The 19 collection accounts total about $14,000.\nShe did not present any documentary evidence showing that she has paid,\nsettled, or resolved any of the debts in the SOR. She claims she was a victim of identity\ntheft and discovered it a few years ago. But she did not present any documentary\nevidence to verify her claim and to show its connection to the debts in the SOR.\nShe presented copies of three letters wherein she was disputing liability for a\ncouple of debts (Exhibits B\u2013D). The letters are from the 2004\u20132005 period. She did not\npresent any response to her letters or more recent dispute letters. She did not present\nany documentary evidence (for example, account statements, repayment agreements,\nor receipts of payment) from creditors, collection agencies, credit reporting agencies\nand the like.\n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n3\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n4\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. And the same evidence\nsupports a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\n5\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. In particular, MC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014has some potential application based on her claim of identity theft. But her\nclaim cannot be accepted as genuine given that she did not present any documentation\nto verify it.\nAnother potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Based on the\nrecord evidence, she has done little to demonstrate an intent to clean up her financial\nhouse. Her efforts are not enough to qualify as a good-faith effort. Indeed, what is\nmissing here is: (1) a realistic and workable plan; (2) documented actions taken in\nfurtherance of the plan; and (3) a measurable improvement to the situation. In simple\nterms, she did not present sufficient evidence to establish her case. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.t:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 25, 2008. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJuly 10, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received on March 21, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on June 5, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 16,\n2008.\nThe record was left open until June 20, 2008, to allow Applicant an opportunity to\nsubmit documentary evidence. He made a timely submission and those matters are\nadmitted, without objections, as follows: (1) Exhibit A\u2013letter summarizing Applicant\u2019s\nemployment record at his current employer; (2) Exhibit B\u2013property settlement\nagreement from his 1994 divorce; and (3) Exhibit C\u2013paperwork related to a debt-\nmanagement plan from 1999-2000. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges eight delinquent debts ranging from $399 to\n$7,449 for about $37,500 in total. The delinquent debts include credit card accounts, a\nphone bill, and other consumer debts. In his Answer, he admitted the debts and\nindicated that the $399 phone bill was paid in March 2008. In addition, the following\nfacts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nthis company since August 2004. He is seeking to obtain an industrial security\nclearance for the first time. He completed a security-clearance application in November\n2005 (Exhibit 1). In doing so, he disclosed a number of delinquent accounts and\nprovided a brief explanation for his financial condition.  \nApplicant has married twice. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1994. There\nare three children of that marriage and they are now adults living on their own. As a\nresult of the divorce, Applicant was required to pay child support and provide\ncomprehensive medical and dental insurance for his then minor children (Exhibit B).\nEach spouse became the sole owner of a vehicle and Applicant took on debt for his\nvehicle. In addition, he agreed to be responsible for six of eight debts stemming from\ncredit card or other consumer accounts.\nApplicant remarried in February 1998, and he became the stepfather to two\nchildren both of whom are now adults living on their own. Sometime in late 1998 or early\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n3\n1999, Applicant\u2019s regular overtime at the paper mill was reduced due to an equipment\nupgrade. As a result, he had difficulty paying some bills. Then in late 2000, Applicant,\nalong with 500 to 600 other employees of the mill, learned that the company was\nclosing the mill in 90 days. Applicant\u2014who had worked at the mill since September\n1981\u2014found himself without a job in January 2001. \nApplicant returned to school as part of a program to retrain workers. Initially, he\nwas required to exhaust 26 weeks of unemployment benefits before receiving grant\nmoney. He was a student at a local university from January 2001 until his graduation in\nMay 2003 when he was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in computer networking\ntechnology. \nFinding gainful employment proved difficult for Applicant. From May 2003 until he\nstarted his current job in August 2004, Applicant had two jobs where he was\nunderemployed and two periods of unemployment for a total of about five months. He\nwas hired by the federal contractor as a material handler and he has since been\nadvanced in that line of work. He now earns about $29,000 annually as compared with\nthe $50,000 to $55,000 he made at the mill. He has a good employment record as\nevidenced by favorable ratings he received for 2005\u20132007 (Exhibit A). \nApplicant describes his current financial condition as tight, but making it. In\nMarch 2008, he paid the $399 phone bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Otherwise, he has not\npaid, settled, or otherwise resolved the remaining seven delinquent debts in the SOR.\nApplicant has a number of accounts that are in good standing, to include a loan on a\nmobile home, a lease for the land for the mobile home, and a car payment. Applicant\nwould like to pay off the delinquent debts, but he simply does not have the extra income\nto do so after paying for his regular expenses. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n5\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns. The most pertinent here is MC 2, which provides as follows:\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nApplicant receives the full benefit of MC 2. His financial problems can be traced\nback to a combination of conditions largely beyond his control: (1) his divorce in 1994;\n(2) the reduction of overtime in 1998\u20131999; (3) his unexpected job loss in January 2001\nafter working nearly 20 years for a paper mill; and (4) his period of underemployment\nand unemployment during 2003\u20132004. Indeed, the mill closure was a devastating\nfinancial event from which Applicant has yet to fully recover as shown by the huge\nreduction in annual income ($55,000 to $29,000). In addition to the conditions beyond\nhis  control, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances when he sought\nfurther education to improve his job skills and employment prospects, and when he\nsought and took work where he could find it.  \nThis case presents both unfavorable and favorable evidence, which requires\nthoughtful balancing in light of the whole\u2013person concept and the clearly-consistent\n\n6\nstandard. I have considered the totality of facts and circumstances and conclude the\nfavorable evidence is persuasive. The evidence shows that in all likelihood Applicant\nwould have never experienced such difficult financial problems but for his unexpected\njob loss in 2001 when the mill closed. In addition, his efforts to remake himself were\nmade more difficult by underemployment and unemployment after he obtained his\ndegree in 2003. \nIn addition, despite the difficult circumstances, the evidence in no way suggests\nApplicant engaged in illegal activities to generate funds, which is a concern under\nGuideline F. And the evidence in no way suggests Applicant engaged in high living or\nirresponsible spending on frivolous items. Instead, the evidence shows that Applicant\nhas demonstrated fortitude and he has endeavored to make the best of a bad situation.\nTaken together, these circumstances suggest that he has the requisite self-control,\ngood judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\nAlthough Applicant has made little progress in resolving the delinquent debts in the\nSOR, his lack of progress is not attributable to unwillingness or deliberate avoidance.\nGiven the facts and circumstances here, an unduly rigid or strict application of the\nguideline is not appropriate.  \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain\na favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with national interest  to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on October 4, 2005. On June 10, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nFebruary 19, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s written Answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 21, 2008.  \nHe requested a decision on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled \nits File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 4, 2008. The FORM contained \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7.  By letter dated November 13, 2008, DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional \ninformation and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on \nDecember 9, 2008.  His response was due on January 8, 2009. He did not file   \nadditional information within the required time period. On February 10, 2009, the case \nwas assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains seven allegations of financial delinquency under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted five of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., \n1.b., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f.) He denied two Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as findings of fact.  (Item 1; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and employed as a lead supply technician by a \ngovernment contractor. He was married in 1999 and divorced in 2003. He is the father \nof one child. He lives and works abroad. He pays no U.S. taxes while employed \noverseas.  (Item 4; Item 6.) \n \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator from the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  In his OPM interview, he reported a \ngross and net monthly income of $7,200.  He identified $2,750 in fixed living expenses, \nas follows: rent ($850); food ($400); clothing ($300); utilities ($300); car expenses \n($100); insurance ($250); child support ($350); and miscellaneous ($200).  He also \nreported the following monthly debt payments: home mortgage ($800); car payment \n($600); and credit card debt ($400). Applicant reported a monthly net reminder of \n$2,650. (Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s assets include $100,000 in real estate, $5,000 in savings, $8,000 in \nan automobile, and $8,000 in household goods.  (Item 6.) \n \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged on the SOR total approximately $25,236. The debts \nadmitted by Applicant total approximately $23,200. (Item 1; Item 3.) \n \n \nOn December 20, 2007, in response to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant \nlisted as delinquent the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b., 1.e., and 1.f. He also stated \nan intent to begin consumer credit counseling.  (Item 5.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn his statement to the OPM investigator, Applicant identified the delinquent debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c as a personal loan he had paid off. He provided no documentation \nto corroborate his assertion of payment. In his OPM interview, he also asserted his \nbelief that the delinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. duplicated the delinquent debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, he provided no documentation to corroborate his \nstatement.  (Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s responses to DOHA interrogatories and his credit report of March 4, \n2008, show that most of his delinquent debts were incurred between 2000 and 2004. He \nprovided no documentation to show that he had made payments on his debts or \narranged payment plans for any of the debts he admitted. He denied the debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.g., and the Government failed to provide evidence to support its allegation that \nhe was responsible for the debt.  Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.g. is concluded for Applicant.  \n(Item 5; Item 6; Item 7.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Between 2000 and 2004, Applicant accumulated substantial \ndelinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \n\n \n5 \n \n \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least the period \nof 2000 to 2004. Moreover, the delinquencies remain unpaid and have occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur.  \n \nApplicant has an income sufficient to pay or settle his delinquent debts, and he \nhas failed to do so. The record does not reflect that the circumstances that gave rise to \nhis delinquencies were beyond his control. Applicant expressed his intent to seek \nconsumer credit counseling in the future. However, in determining an individual's \nsecurity worthiness, the Government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant \nmight resolve his or her outstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do \nnot mitigate the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult.  He \nearns a good salary and reports a net remainder each month of $2,650. He has over \n$100,000 in personal assets. Despite these financial strengths, Applicant has failed to \nsatisfy over $20,000 in delinquent debts. His failure to satisfy his creditors even when \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhe had sufficient funds to do so raises security concerns about his judgment and \nreliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:            Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn March 21, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On April 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations), Guideline H (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline G (Drug \nInvolvement). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 27, 2009. Applicant \nanswered the SOR in writing on May 14, 2009, and did not request a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel requested a hearing on June 12, 2009, and \nwas prepared to proceed on June 16, 2009. I received the case assignment on June 17, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 26, 2009, and I convened the hearing \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nas scheduled on July 13, 2009. The government offered Exhibits 1 through 12, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibit A., without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 21, 2009. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until July 31, 2009, to submit additional \nmatters. On July 28, 2009, he submitted Exhibits B through D, without objection. The \nrecord closed on July 31, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, 2.a, 2.c, and 3.a of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.b, 3.b, and 3.c of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support \nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, married, and has one child born during this marriage. \nHis wife is unemployed. Applicant works for a defense contractor. He has another child \nfrom a prior relationship, for whom he pays $47 per week in child support. Applicant has \na high school degree. He does not have a current security clearance.  His salary is in \nthe $25,000 to $30,000 range. (Tr. 6, 28-36, 68; Exhibits 1, D) \n \n \nApplicant owes $453 for medical treatment he received in 2001 for a seizure he \nsuffered. He assumed his employer\u2019s insurance paid that debt. He did not learn about \nthis debt until 2007, when he applied for his security clearance. He also owes $2,428 on \nanother medical debt. He contacted both creditors about arranging installment payment \nplans, but has not been successful in those efforts to date. Applicant believed that the \ncreditor for the $2,428 debt was to resubmit it for insurance payment. Applicant did not \nverify that the debt was resubmitted to the insurance company. Applicant also owes \n$100 for a third medical debt from 2003. Applicant is paying this debt. These three \ndebts are being paid at the rate of $20 per month each by Applicant. He started paying \nthem in July 2009. (Tr. 54-59; Exhibits 2-6, C) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports also show $78,000 owed by him on a house he bought \nwith a former fianc\u00e9 in 2002. He executed a warranty deed to his former fianc\u00e9 on July \n9, 2004. It was recorded on November 5, 2004. The deed was prepared by an attorney. \nApplicant was attempting to rid himself of any obligations on the 2003 mortgage and the \nhouse. The bank that holds the mortgage told him he continues to be obligated on that \nmortgage. The house and mortgage were foreclosed because his former fianc\u00e9 did not \ncontinue to make the payments on the mortgage. Applicant believes the house sold for \nabout $30,000, which would make him liable for half of the remainder, $24,000. The \nbank has not contacted Applicant in several years. Applicant made numerous attempts \nrecently to contact his former fianc\u00e9 to arrange his removal from the mortgage. He was \nunsuccessful in these efforts. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 61-66; Exhibits 2-6, B) \n \n \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was 21 years old. Presently he drinks \nbeer and usually consumes a six-pack a week. He was charged with driving while \n\n \n3 \n \n \nintoxicated (DUI) in July 2004, when he sped and crossed the traffic lanes. His blood \nalcohol content was .19%, exceeding his state\u2019s legal limit. Applicant was also arrested \nat the same time for battery of a police officer, and possession of marijuana and \ncocaine. He pled guilty and was sentenced on two misdemeanors, an operating while \nintoxicated (OWI) and maintaining a common nuisance. The cocaine charge was \ndismissed or otherwise resolved by the state court without any finding against Applicant. \nHis sentence was 365 days of jail time with 305 days suspended while he completed 30 \ndays of home arrest and 30 days in jail. He also received probation. Applicant\u2019s driving \nprivileges were suspended for 30 days after which he received a probationary license \nfor 180 days. In addition, he was fined $225, and was required to pay court costs of \n$336, and a $50 bond fee. He attended an alcohol evaluation program once a week for \n13 weeks from February to March 2006. The diagnosis by a licensed clinical social \nworker was he abused alcohol. Applicant successfully completed the treatment program \nand received a graduation certificate. Applicant does not presently attend any alcohol \nprogram. (Tr. 44-53; Exhibits 6-12) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1994 to April 1998, when he was arrested. The \narrest was for marijuana possession and reckless possession of drug paraphernalia. He \nwas found guilty, and sentenced to community service, and substance abuse \ncounseling. He served two days in jail and had his driver\u2019s license suspended. He was \nalso placed on probation for an actual total of two and a half years because Applicant \nwas out of town frequently for work. Applicant used marijuana until 2004, and then \nstopped using it. Now he remains at home with his wife and child. Applicant does not \nassociate with anyone who uses drugs because he spends most of his free time at \nhome. (Tr. 37-43; Exhibits 6-12) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife owns the home in which they live. The mortgage is $350 per \nmonth. Applicant\u2019s 1994 Oldsmobile and the 1999 Dodge are paid for. Applicant does \nnot have any credit cards. (Tr. 68-76) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2 (b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Of these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has four debts which are unresolved. Three of the debts are medical \ndebts, for $453, $2,428, and $100. The fourth debt is owed on a mortgage for a house \nin which Applicant lived in from 2002 until 2004, with his fianc\u00e9 at the time. This debt is \n$78,114. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. From these six mitigating conditions, two conditions apply: \n \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe four debts listed in the SOR occurred during 2001 to 2003. Since then, \nApplicant has not incurred any other substantial delinquent debt. He lives simply with \nhis wife and child. He has no credit cards, and he has no debt on his cars. AG \u00b6 20 (a) \napplies to these debts. \n \n \nApplicant is paying on three of the four debts, and has tried to resolve the \nmortgage debt. He is having difficulty doing so because he wants his former fianc\u00e9 to \ncooperate with him and pay her share of the debt. He is paying $20 each on the smaller \nnon-mortgage debts each month. Applicant is executing a good-faith effort to resolve his \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20 (d) applies. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions apply: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2004 for DUI while he was away from work. He \nattended a court-ordered alcohol rehabilitation program in 2006, during which he was \ndiagnosed with alcohol abuse. The diagnosis was made by a licensed clinical social \nworker who worked at the program. AG \u00b6 22 (a) and (e) apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Three of \nthose conditions apply to this case: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident was five years ago. There have been no \nadditional alcohol-related incidents after this one-time arrest and conviction. Such \nbehavior was infrequent and it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \ncurrent reliability, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 23 (a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant continues drink beer, and uses it only at home in a responsible \nmanner. He remains in his home with his family after he completes his workday. There \nhave been no further incidents since 2004, indicating Applicant\u2019s recognition of his \nproblem and the changes in his behavior pattern. AG \u00b6 23 (b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant regularly attended the court-order rehabilitation program in 2006. He \nsuccessfully completed it. He demonstrated a changed pattern of consumption to \nresponsible use at home. He completed the course requirements and received his \ngraduation certificate from the program. AG \u00b6 23 (d) applies. \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to illegal drugs: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed \nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Of these disqualifying conditions, three apply to this case: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1994 to 2004. He was arrested in 1998 and 2004, \non charges which included possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. After his first \narrest he continued to use marijuana. AG \u00b6 25 (a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Of these \ndisqualifying conditions, two mitigating conditions apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana ceased in 2004. His last use was five years ago.  He \nvoluntarily stopped using marijuana as he matured. AG \u00b6 26 (a) applies because of the \npassage of time and Applicant\u2019s circumstances have changed with his marriage and \nemployment with the defense contractor. The past marijuana uses do not cast doubt on \nhis current judgment and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant does not now associate with anyone who uses illegal drugs. Applicant \nremains at home with his family when not working. He is not in a drug-using \nenvironment. He has familial responsibilities, which consume his time, and cannot \nspend the money or time on purchasing marijuana.  Applicant changed his attitude \ntoward marijuana after he became a parent. He has five years of abstinence from \nmarijuana. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2 (c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 2 \n(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is resolving his debts with \nall the money he can spare at the present. These debts arose from medical costs he \nthought were covered by medical insurance provided by his employer. The fourth debt \n\n \n9 \n \n \nis on a house mortgage, and he needs the cooperation of the other owner to resolve it \nwith the bank because he does not think he should be liable for the entire amount. His \nmedical debts are less than $3,000, and he has no other current debts which are \ndelinquent. \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol and marijuana use occurred in the past, and was to his \ndetriment. He consumes beer now at home, and does not use marijuana. Applicant has \nchanged his behavior patterns as he matured and got married. As a father with a child \nat home and another child he supports, he recognizes his primary obligations are to \nother persons, and not to his own pleasures. It is unlikely his past alcohol and marijuana \nactions will be repeated. There is little chance of pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress in Applicant\u2019s life as a result of this personal history.  \n \nApplicant was direct and forthright in his explanation of his past circumstances.  \nThe only debt left unresolved is the mortgage on his former home.  Applicant is \nresolving his minor debts.  He extricated himself from the drugs and alcohol abuse \nproblem.  His mortgage debt can also be resolved when he has the finances and he \napplies the same effort as he has to his other situations.  Applicant was credible and \npersuasive in his discussion of his past problems and debts. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations, alcohol consumption, and drug involvement. I conclude the \u201cwhole-\nperson\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a to 3.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Kathleen E. Voelker, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on December 13, 2006.  On March 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nfor Applicant for criminal conduct under Guideline J.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March \n31, 2008. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 18, 2008.  He admitted the \nfactual allegations of arrests and charges as alleged in the SOR under Guideline J, but \ndenied there was criminal behavior because the offenses were either not pursued, \ndismissed, or there were findings of not guilty.  He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 6, 2008.  \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn May 13, 2008, the government amended the SOR to add security concern \nallegations under Guideline E as noted below for the same incidents.  On June 18, \n2008, Applicant again admitted the factual allegations but denied that there were \npersonal conduct security concerns.  The case was assigned to another administrative \njudge before being transferred to me on July 30, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 6, 2008, for a hearing on September 24, 2008.  I convened the \nhearing as scheduled.  The government offered 14 government exhibits marked (Gov. \nEx.) 1 through 14 which were received without objection.  One government witness \ntestified in rebuttal.  Applicant submitted nine Applicant Exhibits marked (App. Ex.) A-I \nwhich were received without objection.  Applicant and two witnesses testified on his \nbehalf.  Applicant offered one document for administrative notice (Hearing Exhibit 1).  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 2, 2008.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nThe March 20, 2008 SOR alleges four criminal acts of security concern.  The \nGovernment amended the SOR on May 13, 2008, to add allegation 2, the same four \ncriminal acts as personal conduct security concerns under Guideline E.  Allegation 1.c \nalleges a grand jury indictment for aggravated sexual battery and object sexual \npenetration.  In the amended SOR, the government alleged a personal conduct security \nconcern against Applicant in allegation 2.c for being arrested and charged with \naggravated sexual battery on March 29, 2003. In allegation 2.d SOR, the government \nalleged a personal conduct security concern against Applicant for being arrested and \ncharged with attempted object penetration on March 29, 2008.  The personal conduct \nallegation in 2.c and 2.d arose from the same March 29, 2003 incident or event and will \nbe considered as one allegation.  It is the same incident raised as a single criminal \nconduct security concern under SOR paragraph 1.c.  Applicant did not object to the \nadditional allegations under Guideline E.  Applicant admitted the May 13, 2008 SOR \nfactual allegations.  The SOR was amended to add SOR allegation paragraph 2. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and has worked as a software developer for a defense \ncontractor for almost two years.  He is a college graduate with a degree in mathematical \nscience with concentration in operations research and statistics.  He is presently \nenrolled for his employer in an accelerated combined master's program in systems \nengineering and business administration with expected graduation in May 2009.  He \nhas never been married but has a 14 year old daughter who lives with her mother.  He \nsees his daughter frequently and pays child support (Tr. 55-60; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated \nDecember 13, 2006).  This is his first application for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant worked part time for a company from 2000 until 2004 while he attended \ncollege.  When he completed college in 2004, he continued to work for the company full \ntime.  In December 2006, he left the company to move to his present location to work \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor the defense contractor (Tr. 62-64).  The president of the defense contractor \nsponsored Applicant for the combined master's degree program.  He informed the \nuniversity that Applicant's performance with his company has been outstanding and his \nprogramming and analytical skills are being continually tested in complex projects for \nthe Department of Defense.  He notes Applicant has met every challenge and produced \nexcellent results.  He vouches for Applicant's intelligence, common sense, and ability to \nfind solutions to different type problems (App. Ex. A, Recommendation letter, dated \nMarch 17, 2008).  Applicant was a member of the team that received the company's \noutstanding team award (App. Ex. B, Award memorandum, dated November 14, 2007).  \nApplicant's performance reviews with the defense contractor shows he has exceeded all \nexpectations and his performance and goal achievement have been exceptional (App. \nEx. C, Performance review, December 4, 2006 to July 18, 2007; App. Ex. D, \nPerformance Review, July 18, 2007 to August 7, 2008). \n \nApplicant stated that when he accepted the position with the defense contractor \nin December 2006, he left his old college friends and area and now has new friends \nwho are mostly defense contractors.  He has \"grown up\" and is working hard to be \nmature.  He is very serious about life and making good long-term decisions (Tr. 92-94).   \n \nApplicant admitted he was charged with and pled guilty to possession of Drug \nParaphernalia in 1996 (SOR 1.a, 2.a).  Applicant admitted he was charged with assault \nand battery on a family member in October 1999, but the charge was not prosecuted \n(SOR 1.b, 2.b).  Applicant admitted he was arrested for, charged with, indicted for, but \nfound not guilty of aggravated sexual battery and object sexual penetration in June \n2003 (SOR 1c., 2.c and 2.d).  Applicant admitted he was arrested and charged with two \ncounts of profane, threatening language over public airways on July 2004.  The 2004 \ncharge was dismissed. (SOR 1.d, 2.e) \n \nIn July 1996, Applicant, then 19 years old, had just dropped a friend at his house \nafter returning from a holiday concert.  As he exited the highway to go to his own house, \nhe hit a patch of gravel and spun his tires.  He got out of his car to see if there was any \ndamage.  A police officer was parked near-by and saw the incident.  The police officer \nstopped Applicant because she believed he had been speeding.  While looking into the \ncar, the police officer spotted a drug pipe on the passenger side floor.  Applicant \nrecognized the pipe as belonging to his friend, since he had also used it, but did not \nknow it was in the car.  He was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia.  He pled \nguilty and was sentenced to six months probation and a fine (Tr. 64-66, 94-96). \n \nWhile a college student, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery in \nOctober 1999.  Applicant was sharing living arrangements with his girlfriend, a college \nstudent.  The two had an argument after Appellant learned that she recently had an \naffair with a male friend while visiting him in another state.  Applicant also learned she \nhad been using drugs in their apartment when he was not home.  The girlfriend slapped \nhim in the face and he pushed her very hard knocking her to the ground.  The girlfriend \nreceived a minor injury from the fall.  Applicant left the apartment to cool off and the \ngirlfriend called the police.  He was arrested for domestic assault since they were living \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntogether.  The charges were not prosecuted when the girlfriend informed the prosecutor \nshe did not wish to continue with the case.  Applicant and his girlfriend continued to live \ntogether for another six months (Tr. 66-70, 96-106; Gov. Ex. 2, Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) Criminal Justice Report, dated December 31, 2006; Gov. Ex. 3, \nArrest Record, dated October 28, 1999). \n \nApplicant shared living arrangement starting in 2001 with another girlfriend, Ms. \nE.  They lived together for a few years at two separate locations while both attended \ncollege.  They were to evenly split the living expense to include rent, utilities, and food.  \nThey did not always agree on the payments needed and there were constant arguments \nover sharing and paying expenses.  At one time, Applicant observed what he believed \nto be drug activity by Ms. E. in the apartment.  He called Ms. E's mother to report her \nbehavior.  Ms. E vehemently denied the activity and was angry with Applicant for calling \nher mother.  In January 2003, the arrangement was deteriorating so Applicant had her \nsign an agreement to stay in the apartment and share expenses until May 2003 when \nschool ended.   \n \nIn March 2003, Applicant called Ms. E's alleged other boyfriend and drug supplier \nand told him that he and Ms. E were still living together.  Ms. E was very angry with \nApplicant and threatened him if he continued to interfere in her life.  Later that month, \nthey were to attend a film festival as part of a college language course.  Applicant \nbought two tickets.  They were to meet at the theater, but when they met, Ms. E refused \nto sit with Applicant and sat with a friend.  Applicant attended the festival and met a new \ngirlfriend.  Later that evening, Applicant was involved in an automobile accident on the \nway to a party.  He tried to call Ms E to inform her of the accident but she did not \nanswer the telephone.  Applicant returned home in the early morning and was in bed \nwhen Ms. E returned home.  They engaged in a heated argument moving from room to \nroom in the house.  At one time, Applicant pushed open and broke the door to a room \nwhere Ms. E had fled.  Ms. E punched Applicant in the eye and scratched him on the \nneck (App. Ex. E, photographs of Applicant).  Ms. E left and went to another girl's house \ncomplaining that Applicant sexually assaulted her.  The other girl convinced her to call \nthe police and she filed a complaint with the police and was taken to a local hospital and \nexamined by the nursing staff.  Applicant was arrested the next day and charged with \nsexual assault and sexual object penetration.  The case was sent to a grand jury and \nApplicant was indicted and again arrested for the alleged offense.   \n \nApplicant was tried before a jury for the sexual assault and sexual object \npenetration in October 2003 (Tr. 72-82, 106-131; Gov. Ex. 4, Arrest Record, dated \nMarch 29, 2003; Gov. Ex. 5, Arrest Record, undated; Gov. Ex. 7, Incident Report, dated \nMarch 29, 2003; Gov, Ex. 9, Incident Report, dated March 29, 2003; Gov. Ex. 14, trial \ntranscript).  Applicant was acquitted by the jury of both sexual assault and sexual object \npenetration.  The prosecutor stated at the hearing she presented testimony from the \ncomplaining witness, Ms. E, her friend, the forensic nurse who examined Ms. E, her \nreport, and photographs taken during the examination. Also, the forensic nurse \ncoordinator testified as an expert witness.  The case was heard on a Friday, the \ntestimony ended at about 7 PM, and the jury deliberated about 20 minutes before \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrendering a not guilty finding on all charges (Tr.144-156; Gov. Ex. 12, Case Information, \ndated October 29, 2003).  \n \nAt the criminal trial, Ms. E testified that she and Applicant had argued frequently \nand heatedly.  She testified that at one time he grabbed her around the throat and \nforced his fingers in her mouth to make her stop talking.  On the night of March 29-30, \n2003, they had a very heated and vehement argument.  They went from room to room \narguing.  She tried to get away from Applicant and closed or locked doors to the \nbathroom and bedroom.  She was in her bedroom lying on her bed when Applicant \nbroke the door to the bedroom and assaulted her when he lay on top of her trying to \ninsert his tongue in her mouth, and placing his fingers in her vagina.  She was able to \nget away from Applicant and leave the apartment.  She went to a friend's house who \nurged her to call police and go to the hospital to be examined.  She called the police \nand was examined at the hospital (Gov. Ex. 14, trial transcript, at 4-42).   \n \nA friend testified at the criminal trial that she went to the film festival with Ms. E \nand then attended a party with her.  Ms. E received a number of telephone calls from \nApplicant while at the party.  Later that morning, Ms. E came to her house and was \nhysterical and crying, complaining that Applicant assaulted her.  The friend urged her to \ncall the police and go to the hospital.  She accompanied Ms. E to the hospital and \nstayed with her for a short time (Gov. Ex. 14, trial transcript, at 42-49). \n \nAt the criminal trial, a forensic nurse, who had been in that position in the hospital \nfor about nine months, testified that she examined Ms. E at the hospital and took \nphotographs of her genital area.  She noticed a small tear in the labia minora, and Ms. E \ncomplained of some soreness in the area.  The nurse noted the tear but no lacerations, \nbruising, abrasions, redness, or swelling (Gov. Ex. 14, trial transcript, at 49-59).   \n \nThe forensic nurse coordinator for the hospital testified that the photographs \ntaken of Ms. E indicate redness and an abrasion in the area of the tear.  This was the \nonly injury she could observe.  The injury happened within 12 to 24 hours before the \nexamination.  The only conclusion she could draw was that there was some type of \nsheering force, but not just from fingers.  It would have to come from something \nattached to the finger, a ring or fingernails.  The injury could also be caused by Ms. E's \nuse of sexual objects (Gov. Ex. 14, 59-68).  \n \nMs. E's mother testified she received a call from her daughter in the middle of the \nnight telling her that Applicant had physically hurt her.  Since she was over 800 miles \naway, she told her daughter to go to a hotel and she would pay for the room.  She noted \nthat Applicant and her daughter had visited her and also Applicant's parents.  She last \nvisited her daughter and Applicant about seven days before the alleged sexual assault.  \nThere seemed to be no issues between her daughter and Applicant (Gov. Ex. 14, trial \ntranscript, at 69-74). \n \nThe forensic nurse coordinator from another hospital testified for Applicant at the \ncriminal trial that she has done forensic nursing for about 15 years.  She reviewed the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nexamination records of Ms. E but did not examine her.  In her opinion, the forensic \nnurse examination report is defective and does not conform to the required standard of \ncare.  However based on her reading of the report, she classified the injury or tear as a \nnon-specific finding in that the tear could have been caused by a number of means.  It \ncould come from trauma, disease, yeast infection, or been self-inflicted.  Sexual toys \nbelonging to and used by Ms. E could have caused the injury.  The injury could also \nhave been caused by a fingernail.  She observed no other injury in her examination of \nthe photographs (Gov. Ex. 14, trial transcript, at 75-88). \n \nApplicant's father testified at the criminal trial that he has never seen his son \nwear finger jewelry.  Also, his son does not have long fingernails since he has the bad \nhabit of biting his nails to the nub since he was 3 or 4 years old.  He saw his son in \nMarch 2003 and he did not have finger jewelry or finger nails (Gov. Ex. 14, trial \ntranscript, at 88-90).  \n \nApplicant's friend testified at the criminal trial that she knows both Applicant and \nMs. E.  She discussed their relationship with Ms. E in February and March 2003.  Ms. E \ntold her she intended to move out of the house with Applicant because she wanted \nfreedom.  She did not mention she was moving because he abused her.  Applicant \ncame to her house on the morning of March 30, 2003.  He was crying and bleeding from \nthe neck and had a black eye.  He told her he and Ms. E had a fight (Gov. Ex. Trial \ntranscript, at 14, 90-94).   \n \nA neighbor of Applicant and Ms. E testified that she heard no violent conduct \nbetween them.  Ms. E did tell her she was moving to get her freedom.  She saw Ms. E \nthe morning after the incident and she told her Applicant was in jail.  She was with some \nother friends and asked her if she wanted to come to the apartment because they were \nhaving a party (Gov. Ex. 14, Trial transcript, at 96-103). \n \n \nApplicant testified in the criminal trial that shortly after meeting Ms. E at \nschool, they started living together.  They argued frequently and vehemently.  The only \ntime he touched her was in a previous argument after she pushed him in the bathroom \nand he fell over the toilet and hit his head on a window.  He got up and pushed her out \nof the bathroom.  She did not hit anything nor was she hurt.  Ms. E on one other \noccasion while they were arguing slapped him in the face but he did not hit her.  When \nthey moved to their second apartment they agreed to continue to share all expense \nevenly.  They argued continuously about paying the bills.  He did admit to calling Ms. \nE's other alleged boyfriend and telling him that he and Ms. E were still together and \nwere intimate.  Ms. E was upset with him for making this call.   \n \nOn the night of March 29-30, 2003, he tried to call Ms. E after he was involved in \nan automobile accident.  She did not answer the phone.  When Ms. E. returned to the \napartment, they argued and she called him various obscene names.  She pushed him \nwhen he followed her into the bathroom and he pushed her back.  Ms. E. went to the \nbedroom and closed the door.  He pushed it open damaging the door and frame.  Ms. E \nwas on the bed and he sat down next to her.  She got up and he reached for her, \n\n \n7 \n \n \ngrabbing her underwear.  She then punched him in the eye and scratched him with her \nlong fingernails on the neck.  He got dressed and left the apartment.  At no time did he \ntry to sexually assault her or place his fingers in her vagina (Gov. Ex. 14, trial transcript, \nat 104-130).  \n \nApplicant testified at the security clearance hearing that in July 2004, he was now \ndating Ms. I.  He learned that a Ms. C, a married friend of Ms. I, was having an affair \nwith another man who was a reputed drug dealer.  He called Ms. C's husband, R, and \nreported Ms. C's actions.  Ms. C was home at the time he called R and she took the \nphone and accused Applicant of trying to ruin her life.  Applicant terminated the call.  \nThe next morning Applicant left to go to work and obscene words and phrases had been \nscratched into every panel of his car.  He received an estimate of over $4,000 to get the \ndamage repaired.  He called R and told him he was calling the police on Ms. C.  He did \nnot threaten R or Ms. C, but did use excessive profanity in the conversation.  He did not \nsay \"Do not let me catch [Ms. C] alone\" or \"I am going to get you guys.\"  Applicant filed \na report with the police for damage and destruction of private property for the car \ndamage (App. Ex. F, Incident Report, dated July 27, 2004).  The police did not charge \nanyone with this offense because there was no evidence to show who committed the \noffense (Tr. 84-89).   \n \nR and Ms. C also filed an incident report with the local police concerning \nApplicant using the telephone to threaten bodily harm (Tr. 84-87; Gov. Ex. 8, 10, and \n11, incident report, dated July 27, 2004).  Applicant was arrested in January 2005 for \nthe offense of profane, threatening or indecent language over public airways.  The \ncriminal offense involves the use of obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or \nindecent language, or making any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or \nthreatening an illegal or immoral act with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any \nperson over any telephone.  It is a class I misdemeanor (Hearing Exhibit 1, statute).  \nApplicant appeared in court on the offense but it was dismissed because R did not \npress the charge and Ms. C did not appear for the trial (Tr. 88-92, 131-142; Gov. Ex. 13, \nCase Information, dated February 17, 2005). \n \nApplicant's present girlfriend, Ms. J, testified that she met Applicant in December \n2006 after he moved to his present location.  She has a bachelor and masters degree \nand works for the federal government.  After meeting Applicant, they lived together and \npurchased a condominium together.  They recently agreed not to live together but are \nstill dating.  During their over two year relationship, Applicant has never hit her or yelled \nat her.  Applicant does not have a temper and she has never heard him threatening \nanyone.  His friends are mainly quiet professionals.  Applicant is a kind and loving father \nto his daughter.  She described him as kind, generous, intelligent and loyal.  He is \nreliable, honest, and trustworthy (Tr. 44-55). \n \nApplicant's fellow worker testified that he sees Applicant on a daily basis.  He \nbelieves Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and has good judgment.  He has never seen \nApplicant lose his temper.  Applicant is cool and calm and very level-headed.  He is \n\n \n8 \n \n \naware of the incidents Applicant was involved in that cause security concerns (Tr. 36-\n43). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThere are four incidents that are of security concern for Applicant.  The incidents \nare alleged to raise both criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns.  The \nincidents are the possession of drug paraphernalia in July 1996, the assault in October \n1999, the sexual assault and sexual object penetration in March 2003, and the profane \nand threatening language over the telephone in July 2004.  Even though the actions of \nApplicant give rise to two similar security concerns, each security concern will be \ntreated separately.   \n \nCriminal Conduct  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30).  Appellant admitted that he was \narrested for and pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia.  He admitted he was \narrested for assault even though the charge was not prosecuted.  He was arrested, \ncharged, indicted and tried for and found not guilty by a jury of sexual assault and \nsexual object penetration.  He was arrested and charged with the offense of profane \nand threatening language over the telephone even though the charge was dismissed.  \nThe government must establish by substantial evidence controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR.  Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nrecord (See, directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, ISCR Case No. 04-11463 (App. Bd. Aug 4, 2006)).  \nSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F. 3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)).  The \ngovernment, based on Applicant's admissions and the fact that he was arrested and \ncharged with criminal offenses, has established by substantial evidence the four \ncriminal offenses alleged in the SOR.  These facts raise Criminal Conduct Disqualifying \nConditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) \"a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\", and CD \nDC \u00b6 31(c) \"allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\".  The alleged offenses \nare serious crimes.  Even though charges may not have been prosecuted, or findings of \nnot guilty entered, or charges dismissed, they are still allegations of criminal conduct \nthat raise a security concern.  \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence to establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the illegal drug use (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15).  An \napplicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a mitigating \ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)).   \n \n \nAppellant has raised by his testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) \u00b6 32 (a) \"so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; CC MC \u00b6 \n32(c) \"evidence that the person did not commit the offense\"; and CC MC \u00b6 32(d) \"there \nis evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\".  The \npossession of drug paraphernalia happened in 1996, and the domestic assault \nhappened in 1999, over 12 and nine years ago when Applicant was a teenager or in \ncollege.  The passage of time since the offenses were committed is sufficient especially \nwhen coupled with the fact the acts were committed as a teenager and college student \nto show that the acts are unlikely to recur and no longer cast doubt on his reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \n \nThere are two remaining criminal conduct security concerns established by the \ngovernment to consider.  Applicant was tried for sexual assault and sexual object \npenetration in 2003 and found not guilty in a jury trial.  The offense of use of profane \nand threatening language over the telephone in 2004 was dismissed. Since the \ngovernment has established these concerns, Applicant must refute, explain, mitigate, or \nextenuate these facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  A preponderance of the \nevidence requires that the prevailing factual conclusions must be based on the weight of \nthe evidence.  The preponderance test means that the fact finder must be convinced \nthat the factual conclusion chosen is more likely than not, (See Steadman v. SEC, 450 \nU.S. 91 (1981), or whether the favorable evidence out weighs the unfavorable evidence \nor vice versa (See ISCR Case No. 07-16442 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2008)).   \n \n \nApplicant denied the sexual assault and sexual object penetration.  The not guilty \ndisposition of these cases is a jury's determination that the prosecution failed to prove \nthe crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.  I am not bound by the jury determination and \nmust independently evaluate the evidence whether he committed the offenses.  There \nwas evidence of an acrimonious relationship.  There was testimony of a mutual \nargument and fight between Applicant and the girlfriend.  The girlfriend accused \nApplicant of sexual assault and object penetration.  Applicant admitted the argument \nand fight but denied a sexual assault or penetration.   The forensic nurses noted a \nvaginal area tear but could not establish what caused the tear.  A finger itself would not \ncause the tear.  There was testimony that Applicant did not wear finger jewelry or did \nnot have long fingernails.  The two forensic nurse coordinators were unable to state with \ncertainty whether the tear was caused by an assault or some other action.  I am \nconvinced by a preponderance of the evidence from the criminal trial transcript and \nApplicant's testimony at the hearing that he did not commit the criminal offense of \nsexual assault or sexual object penetration.  There was a fight and argument but not a \ncriminal sexual assault or sexual foreign object penetration.  I draw no inference from \nthe fact the case went to the jury at 7 PM on a Friday night and the jury deliberated only \n20 minutes.  The only inference I draw is that the jury did its civic duty of following the \njudge's instruction in reaching a fair and impartial verdict. \n \n \nApplicant admitted he called Ms. C's husband and told him she was having an \naffair.  Applicant's car was damaged and he believed Ms. C caused the damage.  He \n\n \n11 \n \n \ncalled her and her husband and vehemently complained about the damage.  Both \nparties used profane language in the call.  Based on the testimony of Applicant at the \nhearing and the dismissal of the profane and threatening language offense, I am \nconvinced by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not communicate by \nthreatening language with intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass.   \n \n \nEven if it was determined that Applicant committed the criminal offenses of \nsexual assault and sexual foreign object penetration and communicating a threat over \nthe telephone, there is evidence the security concerns have been mitigated.  There is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation.  Applicant was in an environment in which others \nused drugs, but he did not use drugs.  The incident that resulted in profane telephone \ncalls could have evolved into a physical confrontation but did not.  He established he is \nconsidered now quiet and peaceful by those who know him.  Applicant completed \ncollege, is employed by a defense contractor and is consider an excellent employee.  \nHe is enrolled in an accelerated two degree masters program.  He has moved from the \ncollege environment and now lives in a professional environment.  Applicant has \nestablished he is successfully rehabilitated by his new life style and successes and the \npassage of time.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) all apply.  Applicant has mitigated or \nrefuted the criminal conduct security concerns alleged under Guideline J. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nPersonal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information, AG \u00b6 \n15.  While the four incidents have been refuted or mitigated as criminal conduct security \nconcerns, the government has established by substantial evidence that they are \nincidents of personal conduct that raise questionable judgment and unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulation affecting Applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.  As noted above, there were only four incidents.  \nThe government alleged the same action as two allegations of security concern under \nGuideline E, one when Applicant was arrested, and another when he was arraigned on \nthe charge.  Since there was only one incident, SOR allegations 2.c and 2.d are treated \ntogether.   \n \n \nThe government established by substantial evidence, relying on Applicant's \nadmissions and testimony as well as evidence of the arrests and charges, that Applicant \npossessed drug paraphernalia in 1996, assaulted a girlfriend during an argument in \n1999, was involved to some extent in another argument and assault in 2003, and used \nprofane, threatening, and vulgar language towards others in 2004.  These four incidents \nraise Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) \u00b6 16(c) \"credible adverse \ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, or other characteristic indicating hat the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information\"; PC DC \u00b6 16 (d) \"credible adverse information that is not explicitly \n\n \n12 \n \n \ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which when combined with all available information supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules or regulation, or other characteristic \nindicting that the person may not properly safeguard protected information\"; and PC DC \n\u00b6 (16(e) \"personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community \nstanding, . . . \".  \n \n \nI considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) \"the \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; and PC MC \u00b6 \n17(e) \"the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress\"; and PC MC \u00b6 17(f) \"the information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability\".  The mitigating conditions \nfor both the personal conduct and criminal conduct security concerns are similar.  They \ninvolve consideration of the minor nature of the offense, the passage of time, and the \nunusual or unique circumstances of the events to show that the events are unlikely to \nrecur, and that Applicant did not commit the offenses.  Also the mitigating conditions \nunder both guidelines consider that rehabilitation or positive steps can establish \nmitigation.  As noted under criminal conduct, the first two incidents happened in 1996 \nand 1999.  Applicant was a young college student at the time.  Twelve years have \npassed since the possession of drug paraphernalia incident.  In the meantime, Applicant \nhas seen drugs being used around him, but there is no evidence he used drugs since \n1996.  There is evidence he tried to stop others from using drugs.  The passage of time \nand his action in not using drugs mitigates the possession of drug paraphernalia \nincident.   \n \n \nThere is evidence Applicant was involved in assaults and argumentative \nbehavior, so PC MC 17(f) does not apply.  One domestic assault happened over nine \nyears ago.  Applicant had an argument with his girlfriend and pushed her after she \nslapped him.  He also engaged in argumentative behavior leading to a physical \nencounter with his live-in girlfriend in March 2003 that resulted in an arrest, indictment, \nand criminal trial.  In July 2004, he provided personal information about a wife to her \nhusband that led to an argument using profane and threatening language.  However \nsince 2004, he has not been involved in any argumentative or violent incidents and he \nhas a peaceful relationship with his current girlfriend.  Applicant established that since \n2004, over four year ago, he has not been involved in any improper personal conduct.  \nHe established that he moved to a different area, and changed his working and living \nenvironment.  He now has a professional position and is pursuing a master's degree in \nan accelerated program.  His friends now are mostly professionals.  Applicant has \nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence that since the last incident of personal \nconduct concern happened over four years ago, sufficient time has passed that such \nincidents are unlikely to recur.  He has established by a preponderance of that evidence \n\n \n13 \n \n \nthat he been rehabilitated by his new lifestyle, work environment, new friends, and living \nenvironment so that his previous actions do not case doubt on his reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  He established these as positive steps taken to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulate, or duress.  Applicant has mitigated security \nconcerns for personal conduct. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that since the incidents \nof security concern Applicant completed college and is a highly regarded employee of a \ndefense contractor.  I considered that two of the offenses leading to criminal conduct \nand personal conduct security concerns happened over twelve and nine years ago and \nare not likely to recur.  I considered he did not commit two criminal conduct offenses.  I \nconsidered he mitigated the personal conduct security concerns by establishing \nsuccessful rehabilitation and that sufficient time has passed to show the offense are not \nlikely to recur.  He has established that the criminal and personal conduct security \nconcerns are unlikely to recur.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his personal and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:     \n                                                                                                                                                                 \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The security clearance application 3 (pages 2-34 submitted in conjunction with the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) Investigation Request) is in the format of the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF86). There is no dispute that the e-QIP entered by the government is the same document alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b. 3 Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the U.S. residing in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that her parents-in- law (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c) and two brothers-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are resident citizens of Taiwan, and that she failed to disclose her association with these foreign relatives on a November 14, 2006, Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) (SOR \u00b6 1.e). 3 The failure to list her spouse\u2019s foreign family members was also alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a).

On November 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B and Guideline E. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 5, 2007. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 10, 2007, before being given a copy of the\nDirective, and indicated she did not want a hearing. On January 3, 2008, the\ngovernment notified Applicant of its request for a hearing before an administrative judge\nunder \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. On January 30, 2008, Department Counsel indicated\nMay 8, 2008\n\nIn her answer, Applicant indicated that she did not receive the enclosures (Privacy Act Notification and\n1\nDirective 5220.6) that should have been included with the SOR. She printed the Directive from the web on\nJanuary 10, 2008, after she had received the letter from the government notifying her of its request for a\nhearing in her case.\nThe document was accepted as it is a notarized statement of the Applicant, although in evaluating its weight,\n2\nI took note of the fact that it was prepared without benefit of having reviewed the Directive.\n2\nthe government was prepared to proceed. At the same time, she requested\nadministrative notice be taken of certain facts pertaining to the Republic of China\n(Taiwan). The case was assigned to me on January 31, 2008. On February 22, 2008, I\nscheduled a hearing for March 26, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence,\nApplicant submitted an answer prepared on February 15, 2008, after she had an\nopportunity to review the Directive.  Her response of February 15, 2008, was accepted\n1\nin substitution for the initial answer filed without benefit of the Directive. Three\ngovernment exhibits (Ex. 1-3) were admitted, including as Exhibit 3 Applicant\u2019s initial\nresponses to the SOR allegations.  Applicant submitted six exhibits (Ex. A-F) that were\n2\nentered into evidence without any objections, and she and three witnesses testified on\nher behalf, as reflected in a transcript received on April 7, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn January 30, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be\ntaken of certain facts relating to Taiwan and to its relationship to the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC). The request was based on publications from the U.S. State\nDepartment, the Congressional Research Service, the Centre for Counterintelligence\nand Security Studies, the National Counterintelligence Center, two press releases from\nthe U.S. Department of Justice, and a record of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Virginia. The government\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were\nnot admitted into evidence but were included in the record. \nOn February 11, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative\nnotice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the\nhearing and any valid objections. The parties were given until February 25, 2008,  to file\nany objections, and Applicant to also present alternative facts for notice. No responses\nwere received by the due date. At the hearing, Applicant indicated she did not object to\nthe proposed facts although she questioned their relevance to her case. I agreed to take\nadministrative notice of particular facts pertaining to Taiwan, and its relationships with\nthe PRC and the U.S., as set forth in the Findings of Fact.\n\nThe government entered as Exhibit 1 an e-QIP dated November 14, 2006. The security clearance application\n3\n(pages 2-34  submitted in conjunction with the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)\nInvestigation Request) is in the format of the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF86).  There is\nno dispute that the e-QIP entered by the government is the same document alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.a, and\n2.b. \n3\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a\ndual citizen of Taiwan and the U.S. residing in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that her parents-in-\nlaw (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c) and two brothers-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are resident citizens of\nTaiwan, and that she failed to disclose her association with these foreign relatives on a\nNovember 14, 2006, Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86)  (SOR \u00b6 1.e).\n3\nThe failure to list her spouse\u2019s foreign family members was also alleged under Guideline\nE, personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In addition, under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged\nto have falsified her November 2006 SF 86 by not disclosing her travel to Taiwan to visit\nher in-laws in about February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nIn her answer of February 15, 2008, Applicant admitted that her spouse has dual\ncitizenship since becoming a U.S. citizen in August 2001, but that both she and her\nspouse had submitted their applications to formally renounce Taiwanese citizenship in\nJanuary 2008. She admitted that her parents-in-law are resident citizens of Taiwan who\nhave been long retired from their previous positions with the Taiwanese government.\nApplicant indicated that the elder of her two brothers-in-law is a professor at a\nTaiwanese university, and the younger works as an engineer in the private sector in\nTaiwan. Applicant denied any deliberate falsification and explained she did not think of\nher spouse\u2019s family members as those to whom she was bound by affection and/or\nobligation, and believed she did not have to list under section 18 (foreign countries\nvisited working back 7 years) a country listed in section 9 (places where you have lived\nin the last 7 years). After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old systems engineer who has been employed by a U.S.\ndefense contractor since December 1999. She had previously worked for a different\ndefense contractor from 1988 to February 1994 and again from October 1997 to August\n1998, and was granted her secret-level clearance in about August 1989 (Ex. 1, Tr. 57).\nApplicant held a secret clearance for her duties with her present employer until October\n2007 when it was withdrawn on issuance of the SOR (Tr. 56-57).\nApplicant was born in Taiwan to resident citizens in September 1964 (Ex. 1, Tr.\n51). They already had a son and daughter, who were born in Taiwan in October 1961\nand April 1964, respectively (Ex. 1). Applicant\u2019s parents had emigrated from the PRC to\nTaiwan (Ex. 1). In Taiwan, her father worked for the railroad and her mother was a\nnurse in a major municipality\u2019s department of public transportation (Ex. 2).\n\n4\nIn October 1976, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. with her parents and her two\nsiblings (Tr. 44, 48-49). Her mother had successfully applied for a nursing job in the\nU.S. (Tr. 51). In November 1982, Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings became naturalized\nU.S. citizens. Applicant acquired her U.S. citizenship in October 1983, during her first\nsemester of college (Ex. 1, Tr. 53). She took an oath to  renounce all foreign\nallegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms\nor perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required.\nApplicant thereafter considered herself solely a citizen of the U.S.(Tr. 48) and she took\nno action to relinquish her Taiwanese citizenship. She had been led to understand that\nby failing to renew her Taiwanese passport, her foreign citizenship had been\nautomatically revoked (Tr. 47).\nIn 1988, Applicant earned her undergraduate degree in electrical engineering\nfrom her state university (Tr. 52). As a graduation gift, her parents paid for her to\nvacation in Taiwan. During her seven-week stay in Taiwan, Applicant stayed with her\ngrandparents. She also saw an uncle and his family (spouse and two children), who\nlived with her grandparents, as well as her eldest uncle. Applicant met her spouse on\nthis trip. They were introduced through her eldest uncle, who worked with her future\nfather-in-law (Tr. 54).\nIn winter 1988, Applicant\u2019s spouse came to the U.S. to pursue his master\u2019s\ndegree in chemical engineering. He contacted her, and they eventually married in the\nU.S. in December 1990. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law came from Taiwan for their wedding\nwhile her mother-in-law stayed behind (Tr. 55, 77). In 1992, her spouse earned his\nmaster\u2019s degree in chemical engineering (Tr. 62). In late 1992 or early 1993, Applicant\u2019s\nspouse moved back to Taiwan for work as he had no success in finding employment in\nthe U.S. Applicant, who was employed by a defense contractor and pregnant with their\nfirst child, stayed in the U.S. until after their eldest daughter\u2019s birth. In about February\n1994, when their daughter was five months old, Applicant quit her job and moved with\ntheir newborn to Taiwan (Tr. 57-58).\nSo that she would not have to return to the U.S. periodically, Applicant\nreacquired a Taiwanese passport, which she understood was all that was necessary to\nreestablish her Taiwanese citizenship if it had in fact been revoked (Tr. 59). Applicant\nwas also required to register her address with the Taiwanese authorities, and in March\n1994, her name was entered on the household register with her spouse listed as head\nof household (Ex. D, Tr. 60), They resided with her parents-in-law, who were already\nretired (Tr. 64). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law had worked for the Taiwanese government\nwhile her father-in-law had retired from the Taiwanese navy (Answer).  Within six\nmonths of Applicant\u2019s return to Taiwan, the younger of her brothers-in-law and his wife\nleft for the U.S. to pursue their master\u2019s degrees (Tr. 64-65). Applicant saw her older\nbrother-in-law about once a month when he came to visit his parents (Tr. 65-66). He is a\nprofessor at a Taiwanese university (Answer, Tr. 64-65).\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s spouse worked for five years in Taiwan as a research and\ndevelopment engineer for a private chemical company engaged in the production of\nnon-woven fabric (Tr. 62-63). Applicant worked for less than two years in Taiwan. She\ntraveled to Europe on a couple of occasions for her job as a sourcing engineer for a\nEuropean cellular phone manufacturer (Tr. 63). This travel was on her U.S. passport\n(Tr. 64). She also came back to the U.S. twice to see her family members (Tr. 66).\nIn September 1996, Applicant and her daughter moved back to the U.S. while\nher spouse remained in Taiwan. She was rehired by her former employer (Ex. 1, Tr. 66-\n67). Applicant rejoined her husband in Taiwan in March 1997 because she had to\nreapply for her spouse\u2019s U.S. permanent residency, which had expired (Tr. 67-70).  He\nhad been living with his parents, but on her arrival, they resided in a rented apartment in\nTaiwan at her request (Tr. 71-72).\nIn October 1997, Applicant and her spouse returned permanently to the U.S. He\nwas without a job in the U.S. but was concerned about an economic slowdown in\nTaiwan. Applicant, who had been granted a leave of absence by her employer, resumed\nher old job with her security clearance (Tr. 70-71). She renewed her U.S. passport in\nApril 1998 (Ex. 1).\n In September 1998, Applicant and her spouse moved to their present locale.\nUnemployed until December 1999, Applicant spent her time caring for her daughter and\nin Fall 1999, taking college classes (Ex. 1). She and her spouse purchased their present\nresidence in or about September 1999 (Answer). That December, she began working\nfor her current employer (Ex. 1).\nIn June 2000, Applicant and her spouse had their second child. Applicant\u2019s\nmother-in-law came from Taiwan and stayed with them for four or five weeks on the\nbirth of her granddaughter (Tr. 80-81). Applicant\u2019s spouse became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in August 2001 (Ex. 1, Tr. 72-73). From January 2002 to June 2002, Applicant\npursued further education at the university she had attended in 1999 (Ex. 1).\n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan with her spouse and daughters from February 17,\n2005 to February 28, 2005. She traveled on her U.S. passport (Tr. 92). It was their\nyoungest daughter\u2019s first time in Taiwan. They stayed with her parents-in-law (Tr. 46-47,\n91), and also visited with other relatives (Tr. 89-91). Applicant filed a foreign travel\nrequest with her employer\u2019s security office on February 15, 2005, and received the\nnecessary briefing (Ex. A). On her return to work on March 1, 2005, Applicant\ncompleted a post-travel report for her employer (Ex. B).\nIn April 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse went to Taiwan when his mother needed an\noperation. Applicant did not accompany him (Tr. 94).\nIn renewal for her secret-clearance, Applicant completed an e-QIP on November\n14, 2006. She disclosed that she and her spouse were dual citizens of the U.S. and\nTaiwan. In response to section 9 concerning her residences for the past seven years,\n\nThe available record does not include any report of the investigator or any statement/affidavit from Applicant\n4\nconcerning what was discussed during the interview.\n6\nApplicant provided her address in Taiwan from March 1997 to October 1997.\nConcerning her relatives and associates, Applicant listed in response to section 14/15\nonly her parents and siblings, who had all been naturalized in the U.S. and did not\ninclude her parents-in-law or her spouse\u2019s siblings in Taiwan. She needed information\nabout her parents-in-law and was too angry at her spouse at the time to ask him for the\ninformation (Tr. 104). She was under stress due to competing work and family demands\nand was not able to count on assistance from her spouse, who began working an hour\naway (Tr. 131). As for her failure to list her spouse\u2019s siblings, she was thinking only of\nthose persons to whom she was bound by affection (Answer, Ex. 3, Tr. 43, 106).\nApplicant did not list their travel to Taiwan in February 2005 in response to section 18\n(\u201cList foreign countries you have visited, except on travel under official Government\norders, working back 7 years. (Travel as a dependent or contractor must be listed.)\nInclude short trips to Canada or Mexico . . . Do not repeat travel covered in sections 9,\n10, or 11.\u201d). Applicant believed she did not have to list her trip to Taiwan because she\nhad indicated in response to section 9 that she had lived in Taiwan (\u201cI thought I do not\nhave to list visits to the countries I\u2019ve already listed in Section 9.\u201d) (Answer, Ex. 3, Tr.\n107-09).\nIn May 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She told\nhim that her in-laws are aware that she needs a security clearance for her job and that\nshe is up for renewal (Tr. 81-82).4\nOn October 1, 2007, Applicant responded to DOHA foreign influence\ninterrogatories. She answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 3.e concerning whether any of her\nimmediate family members had ever been employed by a \u201cbusiness, educational\ninstitution, or other organization that is owned or operated by a foreign government, a\ncomponent of a foreign government, or a local, municipal, or regional government in a\nforeign country\u201d and disclosed her parents\u2019 former employments with the Taiwanese\nrailroad agency and a municipality\u2019s public transportation department before their\nimmigration. Concerning other relatives\u2019 foreign government employment, Applicant\nindicated that her father-in-law had been employed by the Taiwanese navy and her\nmother-in-law by the Taiwanese government before her birth but that she did not know\nthe dates of their service or their positions. She also added that a \u201cFourth Uncle\u201d had\nworked for the PRC before her birth, but again she knew no details of his former\nemployment. As for her contacts with her parents-in-law, Applicant related it was limited\nto greetings twice a year, although she also reported her travel to Taiwan to visit them in\nFebruary 2005 with her spouse and children. She indicated that during that same trip,\nshe visited with a \u201cSixth Uncle\u201d with whom she exchanges greetings once every year or\ntwo. Applicant denied that she or her spouse had any foreign financial assets, interest,\nor income, or that they owed any financial or legal obligation to a foreign entity while\ntheir U.S. net worth was about $210,000 USD (Ex. 2). Applicant did not mention her\nspouse\u2019s siblings in Taiwan because they did not work for the government (Answer).\n\n7\nOn receipt of the SOR, Applicant realized that her spouse should relinquish his\nTaiwanese citizenship to mitigate those security concerns. After learning what was\nrequired to formally renounce his foreign citizenship, Applicant realized that she had not\nfulfilled the requirements and should do the same (Tr. 99). Applicant\u2019s spouse, who had\na trip to Taiwan planned to visit his family, determined he would take the opportunity to\nobtain the necessary documents (military records, tax records) while he was in Taiwan\nin the hopes it would accelerate the process. He traveled to Taiwan from December 18,\n2007, to January 8, 2008 (Answer, Tr. 99-01). He wanted Applicant to accompany him\nbut she refused (Tr. 95). He stayed at his parents\u2019 home (Tr. 94). On January 16, 2008,\nApplicant and her spouse filed their applications for citizenship renunciation with the\nTaipei Economic and Cultural Office (Ex. C). They turned in her spouse\u2019s Taiwanese\npassport, which was still active (Tr. 98), and her expired Taiwanese passport (Tr. 92-93,\n98). Their applications were accepted and they were denationalized on February 20,\n2008 (Ex. D).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents and his siblings are resident citizens of Taiwan.\nApplicant understands from her spouse that his father had been an engineer for the\nTaiwanese navy until about 20 or 30 years ago (Answer). He then went to work as a\ncivilian for a company that built ships for the Taiwanese government. He had retired by\nthe time Applicant went to Taiwan to live in 1994 (Tr. 73-75). Applicant also knows little\nabout her mother-in-law\u2019s former employment with the Taiwanese government. She\nunderstands her mother performed administrative work for Taiwan\u2019s military when her\nspouse was a child (Tr. 77-78). Applicant believes her parents-in-law both receive\npensions from the Taiwanese government (Tr. 75-78). Since retiring, her mother-in-law\nhas served as a mediator of local disputes before they go to court. Applicant\nunderstands that this volunteer position is at the invitation of local people in the area\n(\u201cshe is respected, well respected in the local area and they asked her to be a\nmediator.\u201d Tr. 78-80). Applicant\u2019s spouse has once weekly contact with his parents (Tr.\n76, 80). Applicant speaks with them two to three times yearly (Tr. 76). She respects her\nin-laws but does not share bonds of affection with them (Tr. 44).\nThe elder of Applicant\u2019s two brothers-in-law has been a college professor in\nTaiwan since 1990 when he returned to Taiwan after earning his doctorate degree in\nthe U.S. He had taught social studies at a religiously funded university but is currently\naffiliated with another university. Applicant does not know whether it is publicly funded\n(Tr. 82-86). His spouse had been a university professor at one time as well (Tr. 82).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse contacts his brother two or three times a year. Applicant\u2019s contact is\nnot more than twice a year (Tr. 86). This brother visited them en route to an educational\nexchange in Europe in 2004 (Tr. 87).  He and his spouse have two sons, who were born\nin the U.S., and are currently attending college in the U.S. (Answer).\nThe younger of Applicant\u2019s brothers-in-law is an engineer working in the private\nsector, in the semiconductor industry, in Taiwan (Tr. 88). He earned his master\u2019s degree\nin the U.S., and he also has two sons who were born when he was in the U.S. (Answer).\nThis brother helped move Applicant and her spouse into their new home in 1999 (Tr.\n89). During their family trip to Taiwan in February 2005, Applicant and her spouse\n\n8\nvisited with his brothers and their families (Tr. 89). Applicant and her spouse do not\nhave any property or financial assets in Taiwan (Ex. 2, Tr. 102). They provide no\nfinancial support for any relatives in Taiwan (Tr. 102).\n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has an aunt and two maternal cousins who are resident\ncitizens of Taiwan whom he contacts about twice a year or less (Answer, Tr. 89). His\naunt never worked out the home. Applicant is unaware of the nature of his male\ncousin\u2019s employment. The female cousin works as a librarian. Applicant visited with\nthese relatives of her spouse during visits to Taiwan (Tr. 90-92).\nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are U.S. resident citizens. Her brother is a\ndentist married to a research scientist at a national institute. Her sister lives close by\nand is a state employee (Tr. 123). Her sister\u2019s spouse is employed by a U.S. defense\ncontractor (Answer). Applicant\u2019s maternal step-grandmother still lives in Taiwan with\nApplicant\u2019s \u201csixth uncle.\u201d She no longer recognizes anyone, but Applicant visited with\nher when she was in Taiwan (Tr. 96).\nA work colleague familiar with her performance for the past nine years, initially as\na coworker in a radar test and evaluation group and more recently program manager,\nattests to Applicant being dependable and very dedicated. She took on a greater\nworkload than what would normally be expected and worked long hours in developing\ntest procedures. He has the highest praise for her work ethic (Ex. E, Tr. 137-38).\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor has found her to be open about her family and her\nspouse\u2019s family backgrounds. Applicant has received rave reviews from the customers\nshe supports (Ex. F). A coworker who has socialized with Applicant outside of work and\nat lunches knows Applicant has been to Taiwan for at least one family visit and that she\nhad also returned to Taiwan to live when her spouse could not find a job. She has\nobserved nothing that raises questions for her about Applicant\u2019s dedication to the U.S.\nor her job (Tr. 144-45).\n*     *     *\nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\neconomic, political, and intelligence activities of Taiwan and the PRC, I take\nadministrative notice of the following facts:\nThe government of Taiwan is a multiparty democracy. The United States\nrecognizes that there is only one China, that the government of the PRC is the sole\nlegal government of China, and that Taiwan is part of China. Under the Taiwan\nRelations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts unofficial relations with Taiwan. Although the\nU.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has continued to sell appropriate military\ndefensive material to Taiwan. The PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most\nimportant trading partner, but Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose\nprimary mission is the defense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the\npredominant threat and has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan. The PRC\u2019s\nMinistry of State Security is the preeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in\nChina, and maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan, through a bureau utilizing PRC\n\n9\nnationals with Taiwan connections. It is U.S. policy that the resolutions of disputes\nbetween Taiwan and China be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international trading power\nand a member of the World Trade Organization. It enjoys normal trade relations with the\nU.S., and ready access to U.S. markets. The U.S. State Department reports that Taiwan\nhas taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and create a democratic\npolitical system since ending martial law. Taiwan is known to be an active collector of\nU.S. economic intelligence. In the past, organizations in Taiwan employed unlawful\nmethods to obtain U.S. economic and intelligence information. As recently as 2004, a\nfemale Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S. State\nDepartment official. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\n\n10\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s family members (parents, siblings, children, and spouse) are all\nresident citizens of the U.S. Following the recent renunciation of their Taiwanese\ncitizenship, Applicant and her spouse are citizens solely of the U.S., so her spouse\u2019s\ncitizenship status (SOR \u00b6 1.a) no longer raises foreign influence concerns. Yet\nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) and his two brothers (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d)\nand their families are resident citizens of Taiwan.  Applicant does not share particularly\nstrong bonds of affection with her in-laws, despite having lived with them from about\nFebruary 1994 to September 1996, and her mother-in-law having stayed with them for a\nmonth on the birth of their second daughter in June 2000. She speaks with her in-laws\nonly about twice a year. When she had to move back to Taiwan from March 1997 to\nOctober 1997 to reacquire U.S. permanent residency status for her spouse, she insisted\nthey rent an apartment. She chose to not accompany her spouse on his December\n2007 trip to Taiwan. However, the risk of undue foreign influence through her spouse\nand his relationship to his relatives must be considered.\nHer spouse first came to the U.S. for graduate study in 1988. After he earned his\ndegree in 1992, he moved back to Taiwan without her when she was pregnant with their\nfirst child. The evidence suggests he lived with his parents during his time alone in\n\n11\nTaiwan, since after she joined him in February 1994 they shared his parents\u2019 home.\nWhen Applicant returned to the U.S. in September 1996, he stayed behind in Taiwan,\nand lived with his parents (Tr. 72) while working as a research and development\nengineer. After moving to the U.S. permanently in October 1997, Applicant\u2019s spouse\nvisited his parents and siblings in Taiwan in at least February 2005, April 2006, and\nDecember 2007. His close contacts with his parents are also evident in his once weekly\ntelephone calls. AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) and AG \u00b6 7(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a\nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) apply.\nFurthermore, Applicant did not disclose her association with her spouse\u2019s foreign\nrelatives when she completed her security clearance application in November 2006\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). AG \u00b6 7(f) (\u2018failure to report, when required, association with a foreign\nnational\u201d), also applies. That conduct primarily raises personal conduct concerns (see\nGuideline E, infra), but concealment of relationships with foreign nationals can make\none vulnerable to undue foreign influence.\nThe close personal bonds Applicant\u2019s spouse has with his relatives in Taiwan,\nTaiwan\u2019s efforts to acquire U.S. sensitive and/or classified data, and to a lesser extent,\nhis relatives\u2019 activities in Taiwan, preclude me from applying mitigating condition AG \u00b6\n8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d). Applicant\u2019s in-laws are long retired from their careers in the\nTaiwanese military, but they apparently have government pensions. His mother was\nchosen as a mediator of disputes because she is respected within her community. His\nelder brother is a professor of social science at a Taiwanese university. It is unclear\nwhether this brother relies on the Taiwanese government for his salary, and there is\nnothing about his academic field of social sciences that makes him a likely target for\nthose seeking advanced technology, security, or military information. Applicant\u2019s other\nbrother is an engineer for a private company in the semiconductor industry, which could\nhave military implications. With so little known about their particular jobs and associates,\nhowever, it is difficult to discount the risk of her in-laws being exploited by the\nTaiwanese government or those in industry targeting U.S. classified data for competitive\nadvantage. While Taiwan is a democracy that generally respects the human rights of its\ncitizens, it has actively pursued U.S. economic intelligence, although there is no\nevidence that Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s relatives have been targeted.\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence through her spouse\u2019s close\nrelationships with his foreign family members may be overcome by deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\n\n12\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d). Applicant\ncredibly asserts a singular loyalty to the U.S. where she is invested financially and\nprofessionally. Unlike her spouse, she has long roots in the U.S., having immigrated at\nage 12 with her parents and siblings. As confirmed by her sister, Applicant is close to\nher family members who are all in the U.S. Applicant has also shown an independence\nthat makes her less vulnerable to any undue foreign influence should her husband or\nmore likely his family members be targeted. Although she moved to Taiwan when her\nspouse was unable to find a job in February 1994, she moved back to the U.S. in\nSeptember 1996 on her own, got rehired by her former employer, and raised her\ndaughter on her own for six months until she had to return to Taiwan to reacquire U.S.\npermanent residency for her spouse. The fact that she was on a leave of absence from\nher defense contractor job in 1997 shows she intended to return to her position, which\nshe did in October 1997. She has only been back to Taiwan once since, which was for a\nbrief ten days in February 2005 so that her father-in-law could meet her younger\ndaughter. She chose to not accompany her spouse to Taiwan in December 2007\ndespite his request.\nAs attested to by coworkers who have had the opportunity to observe her work\nfor nine years, Applicant is very dedicated to her job. She has worked long hours at\ntimes beyond what one would reasonably expect, apparently even at some cost to her\nmarital relationship. First granted her secret clearance in August 1989, she held a\nsecurity clearance for her previous job with a defense contractor with no evidence of\nany violations, and continued to demonstrate compliance with security regulations and\npractices with her present employer. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.\nApplicant did not disclose her relationships with her spouse\u2019s family when she\napplied to renew her clearance. Yet she had already notified her employer\u2019s security\noffice in February 2005 of her planned travel to Taiwan, and provided the contact\ninformation for her parents-in-law (see AG \u00b6 8(e) (\u201cthe individual has promptly complied\nwith existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or\nthreats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country.\u201d)). Some\ncoworkers know that her spouse has family members in Taiwan, and the government\nhas been made aware as well. In the absence of any ongoing efforts to conceal these\nfamilial relationships, she is not seen as vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest because of her failure to report these foreign ties on her clearance\napplication.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n13\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for renewal of her secret clearance in November 2006,\nshe did not report her associations with her spouse\u2019s parents or brothers (SOR \u00b6 2.a),\nor her travel to Taiwan in February 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), although she listed her and her\nspouse\u2019s dual citizenship with the U.S. and Taiwan, as well as her residency in Taiwan\nfrom March 1997 to October 1997.  Applicant denied any intentional falsification while\nadmitting that she did not report the foreign relatives and travel that should have been\nlisted. \nConcerning her failure to list her spouse\u2019s relatives in response to section 14/15,\n\u201cYour Relatives and Associates,\u201d Applicant was specifically directed to report the \u201cfull\nname, correct code, and other requested information for each of your relatives and\nassociates, living or dead, specified below,\u201d which included her father-in-law, her\nmother-in-law, and other relatives \u201cwith whom she or her spouse are bound by affection,\nobligation, or close and continuing contact.\u201d When she responded to the SOR, Applicant\nattributed the omission of her spouse\u2019s relatives to a focus on those to whom she was\npersonally bound by affection. At her hearing, she admitted she knew when she\ncompleted the e-QIP that she had to report the information about her parents-in-law, but\nthat she was too angry at her spouse to ask him for the details. Her failure to list her\nparents-in-law was a deliberate omission under AG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d). Applicant put her\npersonal anger with her spouse ahead of her obligation of full candor. Her listing of her\nparents-in-law by name and telephone number on her foreign travel request completed\nfor her employer in February 2005, did not relieve her of the responsibility to report them\non her clearance application in November 2006, although she obviously was not\nintending to conceal these relationships. She has continued to maintain that she did not\nlist her Taiwanese brothers-in-law on her e-QIP because she was focused on those for\nwhom she feels affection. In the absence of any evidence showing she has a close\nbond with her brothers-in-law, I accept her explanation.  AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to\nomissions due to good faith mistake, misunderstanding, or inadvertence.\nAs for her failure to report her trip to Taiwan in response to section 18 \u201cForeign\nCountries You Have Visited,\u201d Department Counsel accurately asserts the government\nwould have no reason to know from the e-QIP that Applicant had been to Taiwan as\nrecently as February 2005. Applicant explained that she thought she did not have to\ninclude the trip since she had reported her residency in Taiwan under section 9. Given\nsection 18 does not ask for specific dates of travel and directs one to \u201cnot repeat travel\ncovered in sections 9, 10, or 11,\u201d I conclude her negative response to question 18 was\nnot a knowing falsification.\n\nIn response to my question about whether her father-in-law retired from a military position with the Taiwanese\n5\nnavy or from a civil servant position with the navy, Applicant testified that he had enlisted in the navy and then\nfound a civilian job. Department Counsel then asked, \u201cAnd his civilian job was for a shipbuilding company, is\nthat right?\u201d (Tr. 75). The original source for that information is not of record.\n14\nUnder AG \u00b6 17(a) a known omission of relevant facts can be mitigated by\n\u201cprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts.\u201d Applicant was interviewed by a government\ninvestigator in May 2007. No report or written statement from that interview is included\nin the evidentiary record, but Department Counsel had information about Applicant\u2019s\nfather-in-law\u2019s occupation at the hearing that may well have been from that interview.5\nOn October 1, 2007, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant listed her parents-\nin-law by name, and that they had been affiliated with the Taiwanese navy and\nTaiwanese government \u201cbefore [she] was born,\u201d but she also indicated she did not know\nwhat their rank/positions had been (Ex. 2). She \u201ckind of guessed\u201d and had not asked her\nspouse for the details (Tr. 74). At her hearing, she testified that she believed her father-\nin-law had been an engineer, and her mother-in-law did \u201cadministrative kind of work\u201d\nbased on what she learned through her husband. She has not talked with her parents-\nin-law about their former occupations and still does not know the details, such as the\nduration of their employments or the dates of their retirements (see Tr. 73-76). The level\nof detail is consistent with her claimed relationships of respect but not of affection with\nher in-laws, who she speaks with only about twice a year and sees rarely (see Tr. 44).\nWhile one might expect Applicant to have a closer relationship based on the fact that\nshe lived with her in-laws from February 1994 to September 1996, she had\nconsiderable demands on her time from an infant daughter and her job in a European\ncellular phone company. Although her compliance with the reporting requirements for\nforeign travel does not excuse her knowing omission of her association with her foreign\nin-laws from her e-QIP, it carries considerable weight in determining whether she can\nbe counted on to timely report contacts with known foreign nationals and to otherwise\ncomply with her obligation of candor in the future. Applicant demonstrates reform by\nacknowledging that she should not have allowed her anger with her spouse to  cloud\nher judgment, which she now regrets (\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d Tr. 105).  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\n\n15\na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty,\nbut rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order\n10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet be in an\nuntenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family member and\nthe interests of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan are primarily through her spouse and\nhis close relationships there. Through the recent renunciation of their Taiwanese\ncitizenship, Applicant and her spouse have put the U.S. interests first. Applicant is not\nlikely to jeopardize the considerable ties she has developed within the U.S. since she\nimmigrated at age 12. She made a mistake in not reporting her foreign relatives on her\ne-QIP, which she regrets, but had already shown that she is able and willing to comply\nwith the requirements to report foreign travel and contacts.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nOn March 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 1, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on May 5, 2008. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on May 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled \non June 5, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nJuly 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A through N, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. Applicant did not object and the request was approved. \nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as HE I through XII. The facts administratively noticed are set out \nin the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born in Iran. \nHe came to the United States in the late 1970s to attend college. He graduated with a \nbachelor\u2019s degree from an American university. He remained in the United States and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1986. Applicant married a native-born U.S. citizen in 1982. \nThey divorced in 1997. They have two children, ages 17 and 14. His first wife is of a \ndifferent religion than the official religion of Iran. His two children have been raised in \nthat religion.1 Applicant married again in 2002. His wife was born in Iran. She was \nintroduced to Applicant through relatives in the United States. She became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2006. As discussed below, U.S. citizens who were born in Iran are considered \nIranian citizens by Iranian authorities. She maintained an Iranian passport in order to \nvisit her relatives in Iran. They have a three-year-old child.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. He has three siblings who are all citizens and \nresidents of the United States. They live in the same geographic region as Applicant. \nThey have children who were born in the U.S. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Iran. They are retired professionals with no association with the \nIranian government. They have both applied for immigrant visas to become U.S. \npermanent residents. Their applications are pending. His wife speaks with her parents \nabout once a month. She has a sibling who is a citizen and resident of Iran. He is a \nstudent. Applicant and his wife would like to bring him to the United States after her \n                                                          \n1 A person\u2019s choice of religion, or to have no religion, is very personal and is protected by the \nConstitution. It is not a basis for the granting or denial of a security clearance. It is addressed here only as \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s open-mindedness and tolerance of differences and diversity. \n \n2 Tr. at 19, 48-49, 58-63, 83-84; GE 1-3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nparents have arrived. She has another sibling who is a citizen and resident of a country \nthat is an ally of the U.S.3   \n \n \nApplicant visited Iran on six occasions between about 2002 and 2006. The \npurpose of his trips in 2002 was to meet and marry his wife. In 2003, he returned to Iran \nto bring his wife to the United States. He visited Iran on two other occasions so that he \nand his wife could visit his in-laws and so that his in-laws could see their grandchild. He \ntraveled to Iran using an Iranian passport. When he realized that possession of a \nforeign passport posed a security concern, he \u201csurrendered\u201d it to his facility security \nofficer (FSO). The FSO certified the receipt of the passport and that the company would \nmaintain the passport until Applicant \u201cno longer requires a security clearance or no \nlonger works for this company, which ever is sooner.\u201d The FSO further stated \u201cin the \nevent [Applicant] requests his passport, we will immediately notify DOHA of his \nrequest.\u201d The passport is now expired and Applicant has no intention to renew it or \nobtain another Iranian passport. Applicant is willing to renounce his dual citizenship, but \nhe has not formally renounced his Iranian citizenship, as that would be ill-advised. He \ndoes not intend to return to Iran.4 \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. He has considerable assets in the \nU.S. In addition to his current job with the defense contractor, he has other interests. He \nhas a real estate license. He is a very experienced, highly trained instructor in a \ndiscipline that combines athleticism, self-defense, endurance, self-discipline, and \nrespect for others. Character letters on his behalf describe him as trustworthy, \norganized, efficient, respectful, and a man of great integrity. He is recommended for any \nendeavor that involves trustworthiness.5 \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d The U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n \n\u2022 Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n\u2022 Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n\u2022 Its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n\u2022 Its dismal human rights record. \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 52-54, 60, 72-82; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B-E. \n \n4 Tr. at 54-58, 63-72, 85-87, 92; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE A. \n \n5 Tr. at 82; AE F-M. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the world\u2019s leading state \nsponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. \n \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n5 \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \nApplicant possessed and used an Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n10(a) is applicable. The renewal of his Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen could raise \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain recognition of his Iranian citizenship.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nIran continued to consider Applicant an Iranian citizen after he was naturalized as \na U.S. citizen. As such, he was required to use an Iranian passport to enter Iran. When \nhe became aware that the passport was a security concern, he surrendered it to his \ncompany\u2019s security officer. The passport is now expired and Applicant does not intend \nto renew it or obtain another one. To the extent that Iran considers him an Iranian \ncitizen, he is very willing to renounce that citizenship. AG \u00b6 11(a) is partially applicable. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens and residents of Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States.6 He traveled to Iran on six occasions between about 2002 \nand 2006. Iran is considered the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and the \ngovernment of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against its \npeople. His family members\u2019 presence in Iran creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, both through him and \nthrough his wife. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) \nhave been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n                                                          \n6 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has been in this country for about 30 years and has been a U.S. citizen \nfor more than 20 years. He came to the U.S. as a young man to pursue his education. \nHe married a native-born U.S. citizen in 1982, and they have two children who were \nborn in the U.S. Other than his in-laws, Applicant has no family left in Iran. His parents \nare deceased and his three siblings and their families are all American citizens. His \ncurrent wife is an American citizen and their child was born in the United States. His life, \ncareer, assets, interests, and allegiance all lie in the United States. His in-laws in Iran \nhave no connection to the Iranian government and no incentive to bring Applicant to the \nattention of the Iranian government. It is therefore, unlikely Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the Iranian government, a terrorist \norganization, or his family members in Iran and the interests of the United States. I \nfurther find there is no conflict of interest, because Applicant has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in America, that he can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \n\u00b6 8 (b) is applicable. No other mitigating condition is applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.   \n      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Iran. He came \nto the U.S. about 30 years ago to attend college. He remained and become a U.S. \n\n \n9 \n \ncitizen in 1986. He met a U.S. citizen and married her. They have two children who \nwere born in the U.S. This marriage ended in divorce. He met an Iranian woman \nthrough relatives and traveled there on an Iranian passport to meet and marry her. The \nuse of his Iranian passport was not because Applicant maintained a sense of loyalty or \nallegiance to Iran; it was the only viable option for Applicant to travel to Iran, and was \nconsistent with the information provided by the State Department, as stated in the \nHearing Exhibits. He has surrendered the passport to his security officer and it is also \nexpired. To the extent that Iran considers him one of its citizens, he is very willing to \nrenounce that citizenship. He has no intention on returning to Iran for any purpose. His \nwife is now an American citizen and their three-year-old child was born in the United \nStates. He has been very successful and is highly regarded personally and \nprofessionally. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Iran is the \nworld\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism and has a dismal human rights record. \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen for more than 20 years. All his blood relatives are in \nthe United States and are U.S. citizens. His in-laws remain in Iran. His parents-in-law\u2019s \nimmigrant visas are pending. Once they are in the U.S., the focus will be on bringing his \nwife\u2019s sibling to the U.S. His in-laws have no connection to the Iranian government and \nhave no reason to raise Applicant\u2019s profile with the Iranian government. These facts \nminimize any potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant was \nsincere, open, and honest at the hearing. In the unlikely event that his in-laws were \nsubjected to coercion or duress from the Iranian government or terrorist groups, I find \nthat because of his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., \nincluding his uncompromising commitment to his country and his children, that Applicant \nwould resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of \nthe United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

After they separated in October 2003, his ex-wife continued using the creditor 1.b joint credit card for her 3 personal needs and raised the credit card balance considerably on the card before the account became delinquent in 2004 (R.T., at 56, 74-78).

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn May 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 3, 2008, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on June 16, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on July 15,\n2008.  A hearing was held on July 15, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of five\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript\nSeptember 9, 2008\n\n2\n(R.T.) was received on July 23, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his real estate closing associated with his creditor 1.d\ndebt, an updated income statement, and any initiated debt consolidation arrangements\n(R.T., at 82-83).  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days, to July 29,\n2008 to supplement the record. The Government was afforded two days to respond.\nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a faxed cover sheet\nand a an updated income/expense statement.  Department counsel did not object to\nthese post-hearing submissions. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits were admitted as\nexhibits C and D and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated three debts exceeding\n$40,000.00, (b) expressed no intention to pay one of the alleged creditors, and \u00a9) was\ncharged in 1986 with fraud/insufficient check on two separate occasions, ffor which he\npled Nolo Contendere and was fined in each instance.\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the debts and denied the\nthird.  He disputed one debt the alleged creditor 1.a debt) and denied indicating he\nwould not pay the alleged creditor 1.b debt.  Applicant admitted the insufficient debt\nallegations, but claimed they are very aged and should not be security significant. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old principal technical editor for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegation covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant is adopted as a relevant and material finding.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant enlisted in the Air Force in 1981 and was an honor graduate of his\nbasic training class.  He made staff sergeant and served in every major military conflict\n(R.T., at 45-46).  He retired from the Air Force in February 2004 with 22 years of service\n(see ex. B).  With so many years of military service, Applicant assures he would never\ndo anything to hurt his country.  His meritorious Air Force service awards are numerous\nand attest to his trustworthiness during his military career (R.T., at 47).\nApplicant married his first wife in 1987 and divorced her in May 2004 (see exs. 1\nand 2; R.T., at 75-78).  He has one child from this marriage (R.T., at 72-73).\nUnfaithfulness (first by his spouse and then by Applicant) played a role in their\nestrangement (ex. 2).  Applicant attributes most of his creditor 1.b debt to his ex-wife\u2019s\nusing the credit card to redecorate their house (R.T., at 29-31).  After they separated in\nOctober 2003, his ex-wife continued using the creditor 1.b joint credit card for her\n\n3\npersonal needs and raised the credit card balance considerably on the card before the\naccount became delinquent in 2004 (R.T., at 56, 74-78).  With accumulated interest\naccruing on the creditor 1.b account, it reached the  $36,000.00 level listed in his credit\nreports (see ex. 2; R.T., at 32-33).  After the divorce, he began receiving harassing\nletters and phone calls from the creditor\u2019s collection agency.  After reporting the calls to\nthe collection agency, he stopped receiving calls from the agency (see ex. 2).  By the\nterms of their ensuing divorce decree, though, Applicant became primarily responsible\nfor paying the credit card bill.  He was also assigned responsibility for paying his ex-wife\n$600.00 a month in child support and $700.00 a month from his military retirement (ex.\n2).  Applicant has been compliant in these court terms (see ex. 2; R.T., at 51).  \nWhen interviewed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in June 2007,\nApplicant indicated to the investigator that he did not believe the creditor 1.b debt was\nhis responsibility because of the way his ex-wife ran up the card after their separation\nand the harassing calls he received from the creditor\u2019s collection agent (see ex. 2).\nDespite his efforts to try and settle with the creditor, the creditor would not make a\nsettlement offer that he could handle (R.T., at 56-57).  As a result, he made a decision\nnot to pay this account in full as it was constituted, and not to disavow the debt\naltogether.  The summary of his OPM interview was attached to the interrogatory\nresponse, which Applicant approved in a signed, sworn statement he affixed his\nsignature to in February 2008 (see ex. 2).  His OPM account reconciles with his hearing\ntestimony and is approved.  He continues to assure that if creditor 1.b is willing to come\nup with a payment plan, he will start making payments on the debt (R.T., at 31-32, 59-\n61).  But to date, the creditor has not offered him a plan.\nApplicant remarried in May 2005; his current wife has two children from another\nmarriage (R.T., at 72).   Following their marriage, they purchased a home in the state of\ntheir residence at the time for around $220,000.00 (see exs. 2, 3 and 4; R.T., at 40).  He\nassigned a $225,000.00 to $245,000.00 value range to the home in his OPM interview\n(ex .2).  At the time of his OPM interview, he and his wife had put the home up for sale\n(R.T., at 34-35).  When the real estate market in the state crashed in 2007, he\nencountered difficulties in selling this home (R.T., at 35).  After his wife had to quit\nworking for medical reasons in June 2007, Applicant struggled with the mortgage\npayments for a number of months before ceasing to make payments altogether (in\nNovember 2007), and permitting his mortgage to become delinquent (R.T., at 36-38).\nHe was eventually able to find a buyer for the home, but at a steep discount, and\ncontinues to withhold his payments on his creditor 1.c mortgage (R.T., at 64). \nApplicant\u2019s sale agreement that he completed with a buyer in June 2008\ncontained an agreed sale price of $165,000.00 for the property, which was appraised in\n2007 at $168,757.00 (see ex. B).  Closing on the agreed sale was to take place in July\n2008.  However, because the agreed sale price was substantially below  the carried\nmortgage on the property, Applicant is looking to the mortgagee for an approved short\nsale that would have committed the mortgagee (creditor 1.d) to accept considerably less\nthan the face amount of the mortgage (R.T., at 38, 62-63).  At hearing, the mortgagee\nhad not yet conveyed its approval of a short sale on the property.\n\n4\nIn hopes of securing creditor\u2019s approval of a short sale at the agreed sale price,\nApplicant asked for an additional two weeks to obtain the necessary documented\napproval from creditor 1.d.  While still hopeful, Applicant was not able to obtain the\ncreditor\u2019s short sale approval within the time permitted to supplement the record.  (see\nex. C).  At this time, both the time reserved for the closing and the period allotted for\nsupplementing the record have expired.  Whether Applicant has been able to secure\nany of the back-up buyers he mentioned at the hearing, an additional time from creditor\n1.c to pursue a short sale is unclear (R.T., at 65-67).\n With no further word on the status of the sale of the property or the mortgagee\u2019s\nwillingness to accept a short sale to discharge its mortgage on the property, there is no\nway to make any safe assumptions that Applicant will be able to complete his proposed\nsale of the property on terms that he can handle.\nWithout any sure sale prospects of the property secured by a mortgage with\ncreditor 1.d, or documented continuing payments on the mortgage pending sale,\nApplicant remains at risk to creditor foreclosure.  Depending on the creditor\u2019s election of\navailable remedies, creditor 1.d could either foreclose on the property through non-\njudicial foreclosure procedures, or it could resort to judicial foreclosure and preserves its\nopportunity to seek a deficiency judgment (depending on the court-approved appraisal\nof the property in question).  A deficiency, if court-approved, could add significant debt\nto Applicant\u2019s existing debt totals.\nBesides his creditor 1.b and 1.d debts, Applicant accumulated a small delinquent\ndebt with creditor 1.a in the amount of $99.00.  Applicant assures he paid this debt to\nthe creditor\u2019s predecessor and does not owe anything on the account (R.T., at 27-28).\nInexplicably to him, the debt has disappeared and reappeared on his credit reports.\nHowever, it is reported in his latest credit report as a collection item (see ex. 3).  This is\na very small debt, though, on a cable account that Applicant assures he canceled.\nBased on his testimony, the size of the debt, and his exhibited overall honesty,\ninferences warrant that this debt was successfully disputed by Applicant and deleted\nfrom his credit reports.\nRecords show that in 1986 Applicant was charged with fraud/insufficient funds\ncheck on two separate instances.  He pled nolo conendere to each of the charges and\nwas fined and required to make restitution.  Applicant assures that he complied with the\ncourt\u2019s conditions in each instance (R.T., at 43-44, 67-68).\nAfforded an opportunity to provide updated budgets for both himself and his\ncurrent wife, Applicant provided a budget for himself and his wife.  His budget (see ex.\nD) reports net monthly income of $6,774.42, for himself and $1,000.00 for his wife,\nexpenses of $5,826.52 (inclusive of his child support), and a net remainder of $1,947.90\n(Ex. D).  Applicant provides no proof of any financial counseling, debt consolidation\ninitiatives or other settlement efforts.\n\n5\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial,\ncommon-sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a\nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also\na security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\n      Burden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common-sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversarial proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take into account cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant accumulated several delinquent divorce-related debts that he has not\nbeen willing or able to successfully address before or since receiving the SOR.  One of\nhis two remaining debts involves a considerable sum (over $36,000.00), and exposes\nApplicant to further collection action.  His other debt is associated with a second home\nthat he has so far been unable to dispose of at a price far below what he owes on the\nproperty and exposes Applicant to potential foreclosure.  Without any document\nresolution of these debts, security concerns continue.  \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to \u201cindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d and place the\nperson \u201cat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  See AG, \u00b6 18.\nThe still outstanding credit card and mortgage debts belonging to Applicant warrant the\napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC \u00b619 (a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC \u00b619 \u00a9), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s credit card and mortgage debts are attributable in part to his inability\nand unwillingness to address a joint marital debt that his wife exploited following their\ndivorce in 2004, and more recent default on a second home while trying unsuccessfully\nto enlist the mortgagee\u2019s approval of a short sale. His situation, if not resolved, places\nApplicant at considerable risk to suit and foreclosure that could endanger his existing\nassets and ability to successfully control his finances. His circumstances are not\nsufficient to demonstrate extenuating circumstances sufficient to warrant application of\nMC \u00b6 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18.  Quite conceivably, Applicant could\n\n7\nhave resolved his two major debts through counseling, use of debt restructuring with a\ndebt consolidation firm, and restructuring of his mortgage (to include an arranged time\nextension for either repaying his mortgage and/or arranging an approved short sale).\nAfforded an opportunity to explore debt repayment arrangements with his two major\ncreditors, he has not documented any progress in working out payment arrangements\nwith these creditors.  As a result, his efforts to date do not enable him to qualify for\napplication of either MC \u00b6 20\u00a9), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control\u201d or MC \u00b6 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nNeither of Applicant\u2019s major debts (creditors 1.b and 1.d) are subject to any\ncontrolling statutes of limitation in Applicant\u2019s present state, or state of his prior\nresidence (see exs. 3 and 4; R.T., at 81).  While his creditor 1.b debt is close to\ncoverage of the time bar on written obligations in both states, the debt remains\nenforceable at the close of the evidence.  Without any documented payment record or\narrangement for satisfying or resolving either the credit card debt or the mortgage debt,\nApplicant is in no position to safely mitigate his debt delinquencies.  Even though\nApplicant has been able to successfully dispute his other debt (creditor 1.a) and mitigate\nhis two aged check fraud cases, the remaining two debts are simply too large to safely\ndiscount and mitigate.\n For so long as Applicant is exposed to a large credit card debt and potential\nforeclosure on his currently defaulted mortgage, he remains at risk to levies on his bank\naccounts and foreclosure on his real estate, each with potential financial consequences.\nFacing such risk prospects, Applicant will be subject to the financial guideline\u2019s core\nsecurity concerns: the \u201crisk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  See\nAG \u00b6 18\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations is insufficient to enable\nApplicant to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying\nconditions covered by AG\u00b6 18. He is certainly to be credited with outstanding military\nservice and although the imposing trust attributes that are associated with this service. \nWithout more to demonstrate progress in resolving his large judgment debt, however, it\nis difficult to draw convincing conclusions about his overall trustworthiness based on\nfactors not covered in the mitigation conditions of the guideline for financial\nconsiderations.   \n\n8\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ncovered judgment debt and overall presentation of payment histories and\nendorsements, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to his covered\njudgment debt.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegation covered\nby sub-paragraphs 1.b, .1.c, and 1.d of the SOR.  Favorable conclusions are in order for\nthe allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a, 1.e and 1.f of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\n             FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\n             AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c\n             AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d\n             AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e\n             FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f\n                        FOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 8, 2002, and \nrecertified it on May 17, 2005. On April 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny her application, citing security concerns under Guidelines \nF, E, and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nJanuary 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on April 28, 2008; answered it on May 2, 2008; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on May \n22, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 28, 2008, and the case \nwas assigned to me on October 16, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October \n20, 2008, scheduling the hearing for November 6, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 19 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf but submitted no documentary evidence. \n \n \nApplicant did not prepare well for the hearing. She stated she was unaware of \nher right to a personal representative, even though she received the prehearing \nguidance advising her of that right.1 After I explained her right to a personal \nrepresentative, she stated she did not desire a personal representative and she was \nprepared to represent herself (Tr. 5-6). She acknowledged she had received copies of \nall documents that Department Counsel intended to offer; but she stated she had not \n\u201cgone fully through the packet,\u201d because she assumed everything she had previously \nsubmitted was included (Tr. 16). She testified she had documentary proof that the \ndelinquent debts and the unpaid judgment alleged in the SOR had been resolved, but \nshe presented no documentary evidence at the hearing.  \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to hold the record open until November 28, 2008, to \nenable her to present documentary evidence. She timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AX) A through CC, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 18, 2008.The record closed on November 28, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s comments on AX A through CC were received on December 8, \n2008, and are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.j, \n1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as an \narchitectural compliance analyst for command and control systems. She has worked for \nher current employer since November 2001. She has a high school education and she \nhas been taking college courses for several years but has not attained a degree (Tr. 9-\n10). She estimates she is about a year away from obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree in \napplied engineering, but she has stopped attending classes because she can no longer \nafford them (Tr. 53). She has held a security clearance since September 2003.  \n \n \nA former employer who has known Applicant for more than 20 years and is \naware of her financial history describes her as dependable, reliable, hard-working, \nconscientious, honest, peace-loving, and courteous (AX U). A coworker who is a senior \nDOD project manager and has known Applicant for 20 years considers her a woman of \n                                                          \n1 The correspondence file includes the cover letter to Applicant\u2019s facility security officer, transmitting the \nprehearing guidance, and Applicant\u2019s receipt for the packet dated October 29, 2008. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ngreat integrity and extremely dedicated to her family (AX V). Another coworker who is a \nretired Navy Reserve officer considers her \u201cas trustworthy as anyone [he] has worked \nwith.\u201d He states that \u201cthere is no risk\u201d with Applicant (AX Y). A senior associate with \nApplicant\u2019s current employer described her as the most qualified person to perform her \ncurrent duties (AX X). Applicant\u2019s father, a retired Navy chief petty officer, considers her \nhonest, trustworthy, and a great mother (AX W).  \n \n \nIn 1991, Applicant and her mother jointly bought a house. Her mother moved out \nof the house in 1995 and moved in with Applicant\u2019s sister, leaving Applicant responsible \nfor the household bills, homeowners\u2019 association dues, payments on a car, and other \ndebts including the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Her mother wrote some bad checks on \ntheir joint account, including a bad check that is the basis for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i (Tr. 71). Applicant was a single parent with one child at the time at the time (Tr. 35).  \n \n \nApplicant was married in May 1999. Judgments for delinquent debts were \nentered against her in March 2000 (GX 2), October 2000 (GX 3), and December 2001 \n(GX 4). The October 2000 judgment is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Her husband left her in \n2002, and they were legally separated in January 2003 (Tr. 37, GX 1 at 2). Applicant \nhas filed for divorce and her petition is pending decision (Tr. 50). Applicant has a 21-\nyear-old child from a previous relationship and an 8-year-old born during her marriage \n(Tr. 51). The older child is in his final year of college and living away from home, and the \nyounger child lives with her (Tr. 54).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her SF 86 on March 8, 2002 and recertified it in May \n17, 2005, she answered \u201cno\u201d to question 38, asking if she had ever been more than 180 \ndays delinquent on any debts during the past seven years, and \u201cno\u201d to question 39, \nasking if she was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debts. She also \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 43, asking if she had any additional remarks to enter on her \napplication. She did not disclose any delinquent debts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated March 21, 2002, reflected payments that were 120 \ndays past due on a real estate mortgage, nursery and landscaping contract, and a \ncollection account; a personal loan and a credit card account 90 days past due, two \nmedical accounts and the cell phone account alleged in SOR 1.e charged off as bad \ndebts, 11 unpaid collection accounts, and numerous unpaid judgments, including the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and six judgments obtained by her homeowners\u2019 association \n(GX 6 at 3-6). Applicant sold her house in March 2002, with closing set for May 28, \n2002. She used the $17,000 profit on the house to pay off debts (GX 7 at 7-14).  \n \nOn the same day as the closing on the sale of her house, she was interviewed by \na security investigator, who confronted her with her credit report (Tr. 100-01). Applicant \ntold the investigator all delinquent debts except the landscaping debt were paid and she \nwas awaiting confirmation by mail (GX 7 at 2-3). She submitted documentation to the \ninvestigator showing she had sent a post-dated check in payment of the cell phone bill \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) and confirming payment of two delinquent medical accounts (GX 7 at 8-9).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f as well as \ntwo other delinquent debts incurred before she submitted her SF 86 in March 2002 (Tr. \n97; GX 2, 3, and 4). She testified she did not list any delinquent debts or unpaid \njudgments because all her debts were paid by the time she submitted her SF 86 (Tr. 96, \n104). She also testified she listed her delinquent debts on a separate sheet that was not \nincluded in GX 1 (Tr. 105, 110-12). She testified she had copies of the extra sheet that \nshe could provide (Tr. 113), and I informed her that I would keep the record open so \nthat she could provide it (Tr. 121). In her post-hearing submission, she submitted a five-\npage packet from the security specialist who processed her SF 86 (AX A at 1-5); pages \n5 through 8 of a SF 86; unsigned authorizations for release of information; a certification \nby the personnel specialist; signature pages for the authorizations for release of \ninformation; the signature page for the SF 86 dated March 8, 2002 and recertified on \nMay 17, 2005; and an instruction sheet for completing the SF 86 (AX A at 6-21). She \nalso submitted the first four pages of a SF 86 dated August 25, 2004 (AX B), and seven \npages from the SF 86 dated March 8, 2002 (AX C). None of these documents listed any \ndelinquent debts or unpaid judgments. \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission also included an undated letter, apparently \nsend to the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, proposing a payment plan to begin on April \n30, 2002 (AX AA). She also submitted an undated document entitled \u201cclearance \ninvestigation\u201d promising to pay some unidentified debts as soon as possible (AX BB); \nand a two-line document, with no addressee, confirming a conversation on August 14, \n2002, regarding payment of outstanding judgments with the proceeds from the sale of \nher home (AX CC). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse left the state in January 2003. He disappeared and could not \nbe found for about two years (Tr. 42). He did not pay the court-ordered child support \nand now owes almost $80,000 in arrearages, of which about $70,000 is child support \nand $10,000 is spousal support (AX D; Tr. 52). He appeared in court in May 2008 in \nresponse to a show-cause order, but the hearing was continued until December 17, \n2008 (Tr. 50-51). The three pay day loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s, 1.t, and 1.u were \nincurred by Applicant\u2019s spouse, using their joint checking account, without her \nknowledge (Tr. 46). \n \nOn April 20, 2003, a default judgment was entered against Applicant and her \nspouse for a delinquent electric bill (GX 9). On October 1, 2005, the credit card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n was referred for collection, and a default judgment was entered \nagainst Applicant on April 4, 2006 (GX 12). In her answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the debt but stated she had a payment plan in effect. At the hearing, she \ntestified it was paid.  \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on August 10, 2003, Applicant stated she \ndid not disclose several delinquent debts, including the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nbecause they had been paid. She also stated she did not disclose three wage \ngarnishments because she was unaware her spouse had not paid the joint debts and \nunaware judgments that had been entered against her and her spouse (GX 10 at 5). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j was for a corporate credit card for a former \nemployer. When Applicant\u2019s employer did not pay the account, she made payment \narrangement and paid off the debt. She is now seeking reimbursement from the former \nemployer (Tr. 74). \n \n \nThe credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n was in the name of Applicant\u2019s spouse, \nbut Applicant was an authorized user. After her spouse left the household, she did not \nreceive any bills, but she received a summons when she and her spouse were sued by \nthe creditor (Tr. 82).

She made monthly payments in July, August, and December 2007 \n                                                          \n2 The last two pages of AX F and AX G were missing from Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(GX 14 at 36-38), and she signed a loan rehabilitation contract in January 2008 (GX 14 \nat 34-35). She testified she was making payments and had documentation of recent \npayments (Tr. 80). However, her most recent credit report reflected the last payment in \nMarch 2008 (AX F at 5; AX G at 4), and her post-hearing submission did not include any \ndocumentation of payments between March 2008 and the date the record closed.  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial \nstatement on May 28, 2002, reflecting net monthly income of $10,194, expenses of \n$2,260, and debt payments of $5,372, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $2,562. \nHer net monthly income at that time included her spouse\u2019s monthly earnings of about \n$5,165 (GX 7 at 4). She testified at the hearing that her current net monthly income is \nabout $6,000 (Tr. 54). \n \nIn her post-hearing submission, Applicant submitted budget data for December \n2001 (AX P) and January, February, April, and October 2002 (AX L through O and Q \nthrough T). These documents are inconsistent with her personal financial statement of \nMay 2002 in that they reflect her spouse\u2019s net income as ranging from about $1,300 (AX \nK) to $2,400 (AX J), much less than she reported in May 2002. Furthermore, she \nsubmitted three different budgets for April 2002, reflecting net monthly income of $6,196 \non one version (AX K), $4,896 on another (AX L), and $7,317 on the third (AX M). \nFinally, she submitted six versions of her budget for October 2002 (AX N through T), \nreflecting net monthly income ranging from $4,794 (AX T) to $13,177 (AX R). In light of \nthese unexplained inconsistencies, I have given these post-hearing budget documents \nlittle weight. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), but AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised \nbecause there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because several \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not resolved until recently, and her delinquent \nstudent loans are not yet resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not \nestablished because her delinquent debts were numerous and spanned several years. \nThe third prong (\u201cunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is established for \nall her debts except the student loans. The debts incurred before Applicant filed her \ninitial SF 86 in March 2002 were largely the result of her mother moving out of their \nhouse and leaving her with numerous unpaid bills. Most of the remaining debts alleged \nin the SOR were incurred after Applicant\u2019s spouse abandoned her, disappeared for \nabout two years, and failed to pay child support. The credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j occurred when her employer failed to pay the corporate credit card account. On the \nother hand, the delinquent student loans were not incurred because of unusual \ncircumstances but rather because Applicant decided to continue to attending college \ncourses in spite of her limited income. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established (\u201cunusual \ncircumstances\u201d and \u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d on reliability, trustworthiness, or good \n\n \n9 \n \n \njudgment) for all the delinquent debts alleged except the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.m. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nThe irresponsible conduct of Applicant\u2019s mother and spouse were conditions \nbeyond her control. For the most part, she acted responsibly: living modestly, paying \nwhat she could, and negotiating settlements where possible. Her student loans were \nvoluntarily incurred and were not the product of conditions beyond her control. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for all the debts alleged except the student loans in \nSOR \u00b6 1.m. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence Applicant sought or \nreceived counseling, and her financial situation is not yet under control. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \n\u201c[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that [he/she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. . . . All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that [he/she] has . . . established a plan to resolve [his/her] financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d ADP Case No. 06-18900 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008).  \n \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant was strongly motivated by the \npressure of obtaining a clearance. She has resolved all her debts except her student \nloans, concerning which the documentary evidence reflects only intermittent payments. \nEven though she signed a loan rehabilitation contract in January 2008, she produced no \nevidence of compliance with that contract, except for one payment in March 2008. By \nher own admission, she has run out of money. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for \nall her delinquent debts except the student loans. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed several debts reflected on her credit reports, including the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g, and it was deleted from her credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) is established for this debt. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant first submitted her SF 86 on March 8, 2002, she had numerous \ndelinquent debts and numerous unpaid judgments against her. At least three judgments \nhad been unpaid for more than 180 days, and many of the debts were more than 90 \ndays delinquent. She admitted at the hearing that she was aware of the debts and \nunpaid judgments when she executed her SF 86. Nevertheless, she answered all the \nfinancial questions in the negative and disclosed none of the debts and judgments.  \n \n \nApplicant presented herself at the hearing as intelligent, well-educated, and \narticulate. She has never contended she misunderstood the questions. Instead, she \ngave two contradictory explanations for her nondisclosure. She first testified she \nanswered the questions in the negative because all her debts had been paid from the \nproceeds of the sale of her home. She later testified she listed her debts on her SF 86 \nand that her personal copy reflected the listing of those debts. Her first answer is \ncontradicted by the record evidence that the closing on the sale of her home did not \noccur until almost three months after she submitted her SF 86. Her second answer is \ncontradicted by her negative answers to questions 38 and 39, her negative answer to \nquestion 43, asking if she had any additional remarks, and by the absence of any list of \ndelinquent debts in all the documents she submitted in her post-hearing submission. I \n\n \n11 \n \n \nfind her explanations contradictory, implausible, and unpersuasive. I conclude she \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the financial questions, knowing those answers were false, and she \nintentionally failed to disclose her delinquent debts on her SF 86. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to Applicant to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator on May 28, \n2002, shortly after submitted her SF 86, but the evidence indicates she did not initiate \nthe contact, and she provided information about her delinquent debts only after being \nconfronted with her credit report. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct also may be mitigated by showing \nthat \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). This mitigating condition is not established, because her \nintentional falsification was serious misconduct, it was repeated when Applicant \nrecertified her SF 86 in May 2005, it pertains to her current application, it did not happen \nunder \u201cunique circumstances,\u201d and it raises doubt about her reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it creates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \u201cBy its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J.  Applicant\u2019s false answers on her SF 86 raise \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c), shifting the burden to Applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \n\n \n12 \n \n \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). This condition is \nnot established because Applicant\u2019s falsification was recent, did not happen under \nunusual circumstances, and casts doubt on her reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nSecurity concerns based on criminal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s falsifications were \nrecent, and she has not acknowledged her conduct or expressed remorse. Instead, she \npersisted in denying her falsification at the hearing.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F, E, and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who suffered the financial consequences of an \nirresponsible mother and spouse. She has worked hard to resolve her financial \nproblems, but has done so in a reactive mode, responding to problems as they occur. \nShe has not sought financial counseling. Her strong desire to obtain a college degree, \nwhile admirable in many respects, has contributed significantly to her financial \nproblems. She has made great strides in eliminating her delinquent debts, but she has \nnot provided proof that she has resolved her delinquent student loans. Although she \npresented evidence of her reputation for integrity, the record does not support her \nexplanations for not disclosing her turbulent financial history. Candor is essential in an \n\n \n13 \n \n \nenvironment where self-reporting is essential to the protection of national security even \nif it results in personal detriment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, E, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations, \npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct. Even if she had resolved all her financial \nproblems, her falsification of her SF 86 would leave me with sufficient doubt about her \nreliability and trustworthiness to preclude a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.u: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

On June 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nforeign preference (Guideline C). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on June 22, 2008, and notarized on\nJune 23, 2008. He requested a decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A\ncopy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the allegations of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on August 8, 2008.\nApplicant received the FORM on August 13, 2008. His response was due September\nNovember 13, 2008\n\n2\n12, 2008. No response was received by DOHA. The case file was assigned to me on\nOctober 10, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains two allegations under the foreign preference guideline.\nApplicant denied SOR 1.a. and admitted SOR 1.b. Applicant explained his denial of the\nfirst allegation is based on his belief he has no preference, and the government\u2019s claim\nhe has a preference is sheer speculation. In his explanation for his admission to SOR\n1.b., Applicant preferred not to destroy his Swedish passport because it facilitated travel\nto Sweden and throughout the European continent. Applicant mentioned several estate\nproperties he owns in the United States (U.S.). In his closing statements within the\nattachment to his answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that the security investigation\nshould include an evaluation of the country involved. He also opined that Sweden does\nnot hold any animus toward the U.S. \nApplicant is 37 years old and married. He has been employed as a systems\nengineer since February 2001. This is the first time Applicant has applied for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant was born in Sweden in August 1970. In August 1991, he began his\ncollege education in the U.S., and received his Bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1994. He\nmarried a U.S. citizen in March 1995 and divorced her in May 2005. He married his\nsecond wife, a citizen of France, in April 2006. \nIn November 2006, Applicant admitted having a Swedish passport (Item 4,\nSection 17.d.) In March 2007 (Item 6), Applicant told an investigator for the government\nthat he was willing to relinquish his Swedish passport if it was a requirement to hold a\nsecurity clearance. In his answers to interrogatories dated December 12, 2007,\nApplicant stated, \u201cI would greatly appreciate not having to surrender my Swedish\npassport, and given the country in question as well as the circumstances.\u201d As noted at\nthe beginning of this section, on June 22, 2008, Applicant told the government in his\nanswer that he wanted to keep his Swedish passport for convenience purposes. Since\nMarch 2003, Applicant has traveled to Sweden or France nine times. (Item 4)\nSOR 1.a. Applicant obtained a Swedish passport on November 29, 2000, and the\npassport expires on November 29, 2010, after becoming a U.S. citizen on March 31,\n2003. Item 4 shows that Applicant received his U.S. citizenship on March 26, 2003. \nSOR 1.b. Applicant exercised his dual citizenship (which he wants to retain at\nleast conditionally) by using his Swedish passport in place of his U.S. passport for ease\nof travel in Europe, and as proof of identification in Sweden. See Answer to SOR. \nApplicant provided no independent evidence regarding his job performance or his\ncontention that retention and use of his Swedish passport does not constitute evidence\nof foreign preference. \n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n FC MC 11.f. (the vote in a foreign election was encourage by the U.S. Government) is inapplicable to this\n1\ncase. \n4\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference (FP)\nThe Concern. \u201cWhen a person demonstrates by his actions that he prefers a foreign\ncountry over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful the U.S.\u201d \u00b6 9\nForeign preference (Guideline C) is based on an individual\u2019s actions that show a\npreference for one country over the U.S. Applicant\u2019s possession and/or use of a\nSwedish passport after receiving his U.S. citizenship in March 2003 establishes a\nforeign preference and invokes FP disqualifying condition (DC) 10.a. (exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member) and 10.a.(1) (possession of a\ncurrent passport). Possession, renewal and/or use of the foreign passport after being\nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen constitutes the exercise of a privilege of Applicant\u2019s\nSwedish citizenship he is no longer entitled to, particularly after expressing his sole\nallegiance to the U.S. during his naturalization ceremony in March 2003.\nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based on more than his birth in a foreign country.\nHence, FP MC 11.a. (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country) is not applicable. FP MC 11.b. (the individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship) is not applicable as Applicant has stated\nseveral times he does not want to relinquish his dual citizenship. \nFP MC 11.c. (exercise of rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a\nminor) does not apply because Applicant has chosen to maintain his Swedish\ncitizenship after being naturalized a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s retention and use of his\nforeign passport has not been approved by any authorized security organization. FP MC\n11.d. (use of the passport is approved by the cognizant security authority) is\ninapplicable.\nThe only mitigating condition that may apply but does not is FP MC 11.e. (the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated)  Applicant has not complied with FP MC 11.e. Hence, he has not\n1\nmitigated the security concerns associated with his current possession of a foreign\npassport. Applicant should have realized during his security investigation his Swedish\npassport could hinder his chances of obtaining a security clearance. The combination of\nthe security investigation and receiving DoD Directive 5220.6 at same time he received\nhis SOR in August 2008, containing the adjudicative guidelines and disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions, should have alerted Applicant to the adverse consequences of\nretaining his Swedish passport. The FC guideline is resolved against Applicant.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding against Applicant under the FP guideline must still be considered in\nthe context of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing WPC factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant was born in Sweden and is 37 years old. Item 4 reflects that he has\ntraveled back to Sweden several times since he received his U.S. citizenship. His\nstatements during the 18-month security investigation indicate he wants to keep his\nSwedish passport (and Swedish citizenship) to facilitate his travel in and out of Sweden\nand other locations in Europe. However, by keeping his Swedish passport, an indicator\nof Swedish citizenship, Applicant is demonstrating his loyalties are divided between the\nU.S. and Sweden. When Applicant took his oath for U.S. citizenship during the\nnaturalization ceremony in March 2003, he swore his allegiance to the U.S. and no\nother country. The combination of the security investigation and his receipt of the\nDirective placed him on adequate notice that he should surrender his Swedish passport.\nHe decided not to relinquish the document. His decision exposes him to coercion and\npressure by other governments seeking information from U.S. citizens. The FP\nguideline is found against him. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph b. \nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: David P. Price, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines H (Drug \nInvolvement), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on May 7, 2005, and \nwas granted a secret clearance in January 2006 and an interim top secret clearance in \nMarch 2006. He submitted an electronic application (e-QIP) on March 3, 2006, seeking \na final top secret clearance. On July 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines \nH, E, and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \nNovember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 29, 2008; answered it on \nAugust 15, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on August 22, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nSeptember 17, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on September 22, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on September 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October \n21, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \nEach of Applicant\u2019s exhibits consists of multiple documents which are numbered. Thus, \nfor example, AX A consists of AX A(1) through AX A(8). The record closed upon \nadjournment of the hearing on October 21, 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 30, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old electrical design engineer employed by a government \ncontractor. In high school, he was an accomplished varsity wrestler (AX C(15)-(18)) and \nan Eagle Scout (AX C(11)-(14)). He graduated from college in May 2005 (AX C(4)) and \nhas worked for his current employer since June 2005. He received a master\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering in May 2008 (AX C(2)-(3)). \n \n \nAfter graduating from college, Applicant returned to his hometown to accept his \ncurrent job. He testified his first days of work were \u201ca bit of a shock,\u201d in that he was \nexpected to get up early and work regular hours every day (Tr. 35). His first mentor for \nabout three months was an older man who was physically and verbally abusive (Tr. 35). \nAfter Applicant complained to his supervisor, his mentor was replaced (Tr. 36). \n \n \nApplicant was required to take a drug test as a condition of employment, and he \nwas aware that his employer had a drug-free workplace policy (Tr. 66). In August 2005, \nhe began smoking marijuana about once a week with hometown friends who had not \nattended college, whose career expectations were lower than his, and who used \nmarijuana on a regular basis (Tr. 37). His first use occurred when a pipe was passed \naround at a party. He was a non-smoker and his first use was unpleasant, but he \ncontinued using because he enjoyed its effects (Tr. 64-65). Once or twice a month, he \nwould purchase small quantities ($20 to $40 worth) of marijuana from known dealers, \nfor group use (Tr. 56-57).  \n \n \nOn March 3, 2006, Applicant filed out the e-QIP after he was told he needed a \ntop secret clearance (Tr. 38). He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24a asking, \u201cSince the age \nof 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics . . . .?\u201d \nHe did not disclose that he used marijuana beginning in August 2005 and was still using \n\n \n3 \n \n \nit at the time he submitted the e-QIP. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24b asking, \n\u201cHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law \nenforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security \nclearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public safety?\u201d He \ndid not disclose that he used marijuana after receiving a security clearance in January \n2006.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and drug \nparaphernalia in December 2006 (GX 3 at 3-4). He was granted a conditional discharge, \nfined, and placed on probation for six months (GX 3 at 10). He has not used marijuana \nsince his arrest. \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator about his \ne-QIP. When the investigator asked him if there were any changes in his police record, \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use (Tr. 41).  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on February 20, 2008, Applicant admitted \nhis answers to questions 24a and 24b on his e-QIP were false. He explained that he \nfeared losing his job if he truthfully answered the questions (GX 4 at 3). \n \nAfter his arrest, Applicant stopped associating with his marijuana-smoking friends \n(Tr. 42). He testified he will never use illegal drugs again (Tr. 50). He has made new \nfriends among his coworkers, and he is engaged to a young woman he has known \nsince May 2006 (Tr. 43-44; (AX A(8)).  \n \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use and falsification of his e-QIP to his \nsupervisors, several coworkers, friends, family members, and his fianc\u00e9e. Several have \nwritten letters supporting his efforts to keep his clearance.  \n \nA senior supervisor who hired Applicant recognizes he had made \u201ctwo serious \nmistakes,\u201d but supports Applicant\u2019s efforts to retain his clearance (AX A(7)). His \nimmediate supervisor, who has daily contact with him, describes him as hardworking, \nmotivated, dedicated, honest, reliable, and trustworthy (AX A(4)). Two coworkers, one \nof whom is also a personal friend, describe him as honest, reliable, and trustworthy (AX \nA(3) and A(5)).  \n \nA long-time friend and former college classmate considers Applicant reliable, \nresponsible, and a person with good judgment (AX A(1)). Two high school classmates \ndescribe him as honest, reliable, and trustworthy (AX A(2) and A(6)). His fianc\u00e9e, a \nregistered nurse who has known him since May 2006, considers him responsible, \ndedicated, hard working, a great role model, and a prudent, careful financial manager \n(AX A(8)). \n \nApplicant participated in fielding a new demonstration payload for a modernized \nglobal positioning system, and has received numerous certificates of achievement for \nenhancing his technical skills (AX C(5)-(9)). He has received four merit pay increases \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(AX B(1)-(4)), has an excellent credit score (AX B(5), and contributes regularly to his \nretirement account (AX B(5)-(7)).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from August \n2005 to \u201cat least\u201d December 29, 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he used marijuana after submitting a \nsecurity clearance application in May 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); he continued to use marijuana \nafter receiving a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and he was arrested on December 29, \n2006 for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses use or misuse of Adrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). AG \n\u00b6 24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b). \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany drug abuse@ (AG \u00b6 \n25(a); \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution\u201d (AG \u00b6 25(c)); and \u201cany illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance\u201d (AG \u00b6 25(g)). Applicant\u2019s admissions raise these three \ndisqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of \u00b6 \n26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recentness of drug involvement. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. \n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nAlmost two years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last drug involvement. Since \nthat time, he has stopped associating with his marijuana-smoking friends, become \nengaged, and continued to perform well at work. There is no evidence of physical or \npsychological addiction. On the other hand, his marijuana use began within two months \nof being hired, having taken a drug test as a condition of employment. His marijuana \nuse continued after he was granted a clearance, and he compounded his problems by \nfalsifying his e-QIP. His conduct reflects immaturity, susceptibility to peer pressure, and \nwillingness to lie to protect his job. He used marijuana weekly for more than a year, from \nAugust 2005 until the end of December 2006. He did not terminate his marijuana use \nvoluntarily and would likely have continued it for a while had he not been arrested. \nSince his arrest, he has been under pressure to retain his clearance. I am not convinced \nthat sufficient time has elapsed for him to demonstrate rehabilitation. Thus, I conclude \nthat his drug abuse is not \u201cso long ago\u201d within the meaning of AG 46(a). See ISCR Case \nNo. 06-18270, 2007 WL 4379282 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (drug use after pre-\nemployment drug test and applying for a clearance \u201cundercuts\u201d a finding of \nrehabilitation). \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) also is not established in light \nof Applicant\u2019s weekly use of marijuana from August 2005 until the end of December \n2006. The third prong (\u201cunder circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is not \nestablished because his marijuana use occurred in ordinary social situations, not \nunusual circumstances. Finally, the fourth prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) is not \nestablished because his multiple breaches of trust, by regularly using marijuana while \nholding a clearance and attempting to conceal his marijuana use to protect himself, cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n26(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4). Applicant has stopped associating with marijuana-using associates and \nhas changed his recreational environment, but he has not established an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence or submitted a signed statement of intent. Furthermore, his \ndeclared statement to refrain from future drug use is undercut by his breaches of trust \ndiscussed above under AG \u00b6 26(a). I conclude AG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished because Applicant has not sought any counseling or treatment.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleged Applicant\u2019s drug abuse under this guideline (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nand alleges he falsified his e-QIP by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions 24a and 24b and \nintentionally failing to disclose his marijuana use (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2,b-2,c).  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions arising under this guideline for Applicant\u2019s \ndrug involvement are \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(d)); \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made \nby the individual to the employer as a condition of employment\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(f)); and \n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(g)). Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated use of marijuana, association with marijuana users and marijuana dealers, \nviolation of his company\u2019s drug policy, and illegal conduct that could affect his personal, \nprofessional, and community standing raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d), (f), and (g). \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c is \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). This disqualifying condition is raised by Applicant\u2019s \nadmission that he deliberately omitted information about his marijuana use because he \nwas afraid he would lose his job if he disclosed it.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant admitted his drug involvement to a security investigator \nin February 2007, about 11 months after submitting his falsified application. There is no \nevidence contradicting Applicant\u2019s testimony that he disclosed his drug involvement in \nresponse to any open-ended question whether he had anything to add to his \napplication. The record does not reflect whether he was confronted with evidence of his \narrest. Applicant receives some credit for disclosing his drug involvement to the \ninvestigator, but his efforts to correct the omission were not prompt. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n17(b) is not fully established. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications were recent and not \u201cminor,\u201d as discussed below under \nGuideline J. His two false answers on his e-QIP arguably are infrequent, but they \noccurred in the context of Applicant \u201cliving a lie\u201d by seeking to upgrade his clearance \nwhile regularly using marijuana. His falsifications did not occur under unique \ncircumstances, and they cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has not sought counseling, but he \nhas acknowledged his behavior, stopped associating with his fellow marijuana users, \nand concentrated on using his off-duty time more productively. As noted under \nGuideline H, it is too soon to determine whether his behavior is unlikely to recur. Thus, I \nconclude this mitigating condition is not fully established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated \u201cif the individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e). This mitigating condition is established because Applicant has fully disclosed his \nbehavior to his supervisors, coworkers, friends, and his fianc\u00e9e. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cassociation \nwith persons involved in criminal activity has ceased.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). This condition is \nestablished because Applicant no longer associates with his marijuana-smoking \ncompanions. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s falsification of his e-QIP and arrest for \npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia under this guideline. The concern \nraised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \u201cCriminal conduct creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and \nregulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation \nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally \ncharged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \n\n \n9 \n \n \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J.  Applicant\u2019s false answers on his e-QIP and his \narrest for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). They also may be \nmitigated if, \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). For the reasons set out above concerning AG \u00b6 26(a) under \nGuideline H, I conclude neither of these mitigating conditions is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H, E, and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant grew up as a clean-cut, conscientious young man\u2014an Eagle Scout \nand a varsity athlete. He was a good student in college. He presented himself at the \nhearing as articulate, intelligent, sincere, and contrite. He started his current job \nimmediately after he graduated from college, and he received a clearance six months \nlater. He had some problems transitioning from college life to the demands of the \nworkplace. Two months after being hired, he began smoking marijuana regularly and \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfrequently, even though he knew drug use violated his company\u2019s policy. While he is a \ntalented engineer, he appears to have lacked maturity and appreciation for the \nresponsibilities of adulthood and a security clearance. He enjoyed and actively \nparticipated in the camaraderie of his marijuana-smoking friends, demonstrating a lack \nof appreciation for the trust and confidence implicit in the granting of a security \nclearance. He further demonstrated his immaturity when he lied on his application for a \nhigher level of clearance. He needs to establish a track record of maturity, reliability, \nand good judgment to overcome the doubts his marijuana use and lack of candor have \nraised.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, E, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement, personal \nconduct, and criminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He says  that Turkey considers him a dual citizen.  He has traveled to Turkey ten times\nsince the late 1990s.  After acquiring U.S. citizenship, he used a Turkish passport which has\nexpired and been destroyed.  Applicant participated in three weeks of military training with the\nTurkish Army after becoming a U.S. citizen.  He paid Turkey $7000 to avoid further service.  \nThe Judge erred in concluding that Applicant met his burden as to mitigation under Guideline C.  \nHis Turkish military service, after becoming a U.S. citizen, raises trustworthiness concerns.  He\nsaid  he is on reserve status and should Turkey go to war, he is subject  to recall.  He  provided no\nevidence to mitigate concerns arising out of his military service or status. An applicant who has\nprovided no information on a matter of concern cannot, as a matter of law or logic, be said to\nhave met a burden of persuasion.  Guideline C contemplates a broad scope of concern that an\napplicant with a foreign preference may be prone to act according to that preference.  The\nconcern is not limited to hostile countries.  An applicant\u2019s preference even for a nation with\nwhich the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, may pose a concern.

On June 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising\nApplicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan.\n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On\nDecember 8, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by\nconcluding that Applicant had mitigated trustworthiness concerns arising from his recent service in\nthe Turkish military while a U.S. citizen; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had\nmitigated the Guideline B trustworthiness concerns; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 41 year old employee of a federal contractor.  He holds a B.S. in geological\nengineering and a M.B.A. in finance and banking.  \nApplicant was born and raised in Turkey.  He came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and became\na U.S. citizen in the early 2000s.  He acknowledges that Turkey considers him a dual citizen, and he\n\u201chas expressed a willingness to renounce his Turkish citizenship.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He has traveled\nto Turkey ten times since the late 1990s.  He has traveled on a Turkish passport even after having\nacquired U.S. citizenship.  The passport has now expired and he has destroyed it.

Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nAny factual issues raised by Department Counsel\u2019s appeal will be addressed in the discussion\nbelow.\n \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a\ntrustworthiness designation if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns,\nthe burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\nRather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as\na whole.\u201d  See ADP Case No. 05-12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  A trustworthiness\ndesignation must be guided by common sense in light of the record as a whole.  See Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.3.  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of the Directive or other applicable\nfederal law. See ADP Case No. 06-12901 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2007).  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had met his\nburden of persuasion as to mitigation under Guideline C.  This argument has merit.  The Judge\nproperly concluded that Applicant\u2019s service in the Turkish military, after having become a U.S.\n\nThe Board notes that Applicant chose to have his case decided upon the written record, with the result that his\n1\ncredibility could not be evaluated in the context of a hearing.  See ISCR Case No. 08-00899 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 29,\n2008). \n4\ncitizen, raised trustworthiness concerns.  See, e. g., Item 5, Interrogatories, at 5, which contains a\nsummary of Applicant\u2019s Personal Subject Interview.  This document, which was authenticated by\nApplicant, says that Applicant had attended boot camp for three weeks and had subsequently paid\nthe Turkish government $7000 in an effort to avoid further service.  This document also says that\nApplicant told the interviewer that:  \u201cEven though [Applicant] paid money as to not serve in the\nmilitary, [he] is still considered to be on reserve status.  Due to [Applicant\u2019s] reserve status if Turkey\nwould go to war, [Applicant] would be eligible to be drafted.\u201d  As the Judge observed, the File of\nRelevant Material raises concerns under, inter alia, Directive \u00b6 E2.10(a)(2) (\u201c[M]ilitary service or\na willingness to bear arms for a foreign country[.]\u201d)  \nHowever, an examination of the record demonstrates that Applicant provided no evidence\nto rebut or mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising out of his foreign military service and the fact\nthat (at least as far as Applicant understands) Turkey still views him as subject to recall.  The Judge\nappears to acknowledge this in her findings:  \u201c[Applicant] has not provided any information about\nthe government\u2019s allegation that he is a member of the Turkish military reserves.\u201d   Decision at 4.\n1\nNevertheless, she concluded that \u201cApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns about\n. . . his military service.  While Applicant may still be a member of the Turkish military reserves, and\nas such could be called to active duty in the Turkish military, there is little likelihood that future\nservice in the Turkish military would be against the U.S.\u201d  Decision at 9.  In other words, the Judge\nfound correctly that Applicant\u2019s Turkish military service raised a trustworthiness concerns.  One\naspect of this concern is the possible extent to which he could be called to active duty in the Turkish\nmilitary.  She also found that Applicant had provided no information to rebut that concern.\nNevertheless, she concluded that he had met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation. This\nconclusion is, on its face, unsustainable.  Obviously, an applicant who has provided no information\non a matter of trustworthiness concern cannot, as a matter of law or logic, be said to have met a\nburden of persuasion.  \nMoreover, Guideline C contemplates a broad scope of concern when an applicant has\nmanifested a preference for another country, that the applicant \u201cmay be prone to provide information\nor make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.9.  This\nlanguage does not limit the concern to countries that are hostile to the U.S. or with which the U.S.\ncould, in the foreseeable future, find itself at war.  Under the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s\npreference, explicit or implied, even for a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful\nrelations, might pose a challenge to U.S. interests.  The record in Applicant\u2019s case is not sufficient\nto sustain a conclusion that he has mitigated the Guideline C trustworthiness concerns arising from\nhis recent Turkish military service.  The Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.  In light of this\nconclusion the Board need not address the remaining issues which Department Counsel has raised\non appeal.\n\n5\n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness designation is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under\nGuidelines B and C for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as\namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDecember 8, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 23, 2008. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations on July 7, 2008, and requested a\ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on September 17, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nSeptember 28, 2008. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He timely responded, but did\nnot submit additional documentary evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on\nNovember 19, 2008. The government submitted six exhibits, which have been marked\nas Item 1-6 and admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been\nmarked and admitted as Item 3.\nAdministrative Notice\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel requested that administrative notice be taken\nof certain factual information pertaining to the country of Turkey referenced in four\ndocuments. (Items I \u2013 IV.) The following is a summary of the facts which administrative\nnotice is taken.\n \nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system and a\npresident with limited powers. In foreign relations, Turkey\u2019s primary political, economic,\nand security ties are with the West. Turkey entered NATO in 1952 and serves as the\norganization\u2019s vital eastern anchor, controlling access from the Black Sea to the\nMediterranean Sea. Turkey is in the process of seeking admission to the European\nUnion. Turkey shares borders with Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The United States (U.S.) and\nTurkey have a close relationship that began in 1947 with an agreement implementing\nthe Truman Doctine. Turkey cooperates closely with the U.S. on a number of security\nissues. (Item I at 1-2, 6-7.)  \nDomestic and transnational terrorist groups have targeted Turkish citizens and\nforeigners in Turkey for more than 40 years. Terrorist bombings over the past five years\n\u2013 some causing significant numbers of casualties \u2013 have struck religious, government,\ngovernment-owned, political, tourist and business targets in a number of locations in\nTurkey. A variety of leftist or Islamic terrorist groups have targeted U.S. and Western\ninterests as well. Terrorists claiming association with Al-Qaeda were responsible for\nsuicide bombings in Istanbul in 2003 that targeted Western interests. The possibility of\nterrorist attacks, both national and indigenous, remains high. (Item III at 28-29; Item IV\nat 2-3.)\nOutside observers deemed recent elections in Turkey as fair and free. The\nTurkish government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,\nserious problems remained in several areas, including a documented rise in cases of\ntorture, beating and abuse by security forces. Other forms of human rights abuses\ncontinue with respect to detainees, fair criminal trials, freedom of speech, the press and\nreligion. In addition, societal attitudes of \u201chonor killing\u201d of women continue to be a\nwidespread problem. (Item II at 1, 6-15, 17-22.) The U.S. government has provided\n\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF-85P)) at 1, 2, 4, 7.\n1\nId at 1; Item 3 (Response to SOR) at 3; Item 6 (interrogatories and answers) at 2-4.\n2\nItem 3, supra note 2, at 1; Item 4, supra note 1, at 6.\n3\n3\nmilitary equipment and support to Turkey. The Turkish government is not an active\ncollector of U. S. economic or military systems. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 7, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 2.a to 2.c of the SOR, with explanations. He partially\nadmitted the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.f and denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c\nand 1.g of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for\neligibility for a public trust position.  \nApplicant, who is 41 years old, has a Bachelor of Science degree in geological\nengineering and a Masters of Business Administration in finance and banking. He\nworks for a Department of Defense contractor as a manager. He has worked for his\npresent employer since March 2001. In the last 10 years, three other federal agencies\nhave investigated his background and granted him access to classified information. The\nrecord lacks any reported violations of security procedures by Applicant.1\nApplicant was born and raised in Turkey. He immigrated to the U.S. in February\n1992. He became a U. S. citizen in 2003 and acknowledges a dual citizenship with\nTurkey.  He has expressed a willingness to renounce his Turkish citizenship. He\ntraveled to Turkey 10 times between 1997 and 2007. With the exception of the last two\ntrips in 2007, he traveled to Turkey for visits with his family and pleasure. In August\n2007, he returned to Turkey to visit his seriously ill mother who died a month later. He\nagain returned to Turkey in September 2007 for her funeral. He held a Turkish\npassport, which he used to travel to Turkey, after obtaining his U.S. citizenship. His\nTurkish passport expired in May 2007 and he has destroyed it. He now uses his U.S.\npassport to travel to Turkey. He and his wife have traveled to the Dominican Republic\nand Germany for pleasure.2\nApplicant married in September 2004. His wife was born in Turkey, but lives with\nApplicant in the U.S. She plans on becoming a U.S. citizen when she is eligible, which\nis at the end of 2008. They have a 22-month-old son who is a U.S. citizen by birth. They\nown property in the U.S.3\nApplicant is the youngest of six children. His three sisters and two brothers are\ncitizens of and reside in Turkey. His mother died in September 2007 and his father died\nin 1976. He talks with his siblings by telephone regularly. He speaks by telephone with\none brother on a weekly basis, approximately twice a month with his sisters, and once\nevery two or three months with his oldest brother. He sees his siblings once or twice a\nyear, when he visits Turkey or they visit him. He communicates either by phone or in\n\nItem 5 (interrogatories and answers) at 3-8, 12.\n4\nId.; Item 3, supra note 2, at 2.\n5\nId.\n6\nItem 3, supra note 2, at 2; Item 5, supra note 4, at 5.\n7\nId.\n8\nItem 5, supra note 4, at 5.\n9\n4\nperson approximately six times a year with his aunt and uncle, who are citizens of and\nreside in the United States.4\nApplicant\u2019s 49-year-old brother works for a commercial bank which is subsidized\nby the Turkish government. This brother works in banking and not in any government\nposition or function. His 53-year-old sister works as a history teacher at a state school.\nHis 51-year-old sister has retired from her position as an architect with a local\nmunicipality. His 47-year-old sister has never worked and her income is derived from\nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s retirement. His 55-year-old brother works for the Turkish health\nsystem as a provider. His siblings do not have direct contact with government or military\nofficials in Turkey and do not work directly with the government in positions making or\nimplementing government policy, particularly international policy.    \n5\nApplicant\u2019s wife works for an international bank in the United States as a\nconsultant. The bank hired her in June 2002 on a one-year contract, which has been\nrenewed every year since 2002. She obtained this job after graduating from college.\nSince the Turkish government paid for her education, it required her to work for a period\nof time.6\nAs a Turkish citizen, Applicant is required to serve in the Turkish military or pay a\nfee. Prior to completing his SF 85P, Applicant participated in three weeks of military\ntraining with the Turkish Army in July 2006. Rather than commit to eight months of\nmilitary duty as required for Turkish citizens, Applicant paid $7,000 to the Turkish\ngovernment, which fulfilled his military obligation. He completed his military obligation to\nplease his mother. At the time, he was not aware that negative consequences would\noccur as a result of his decision.  He is willing to renounce his Turkish citizenship, if\n7\nnecessary. He has not provided any information about the government\u2019s allegation that\nhe is a member of the Turkish military reserves. Nonetheless, his first priority is to the\nU.S. and protecting the interests of the U.S.8\nApplicant does not believe his family contacts and visits to Turkey impact his\nloyalty to the U.S. His family members in Turkey do not know that he is seeking a\ntrustworthiness determination. His wife does know.9\n\n5\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n\n6\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG \u00b6 6:      \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security\nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following\npotentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case.\nFI DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in\nTurkey. His two brothers and three sisters are citizens of and reside in Turkey. He\nregularly speaks with his siblings by telephone and has traveled on numerous\noccasions to visit family members in Turkey. Applicant\u2019s numerous visits to Turkey to\nvisit family members create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, manipulation and\ninducement. \nThis disqualifying condition does not apply to his wife, uncle and aunt. While his\nwife is still a Turkish citizen, she resides with him and his son in the U.S. and plans to\napply for U.S. citizenship shortly, as soon as she is eligible to apply. His aunt and uncle\nhave become U.S. citizens and reside in the U.S. Thus, his wife, aunt and uncle do not\ncreate a heightened risk for foreign exploitation, manipulation and inducement.\nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup or country by providing that information) applies for the same reason.  Applicant\n\n7\nhas close contact with his family members who reside in Turkey. His close ties to his\nrelatives in Turkey is evident based on his numerous visits to Turkey and frequent\ntelephone contact with his siblings.\nFI DC \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion) potentially applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s wife\nbecause she is not yet a U.S. citizen. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from Foreign Influence. The following Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI\nMC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case.\nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S.) applies. Family contacts and ties with persons in a foreign\ncountry are not automatically disqualifying but require the applicant to present evidence\nin mitigation and extenuation that he qualifies for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s ties\nto his relatives in Turkey are based on familial relationships. None of his family\nmembers, who are citizens of and reside in Turkey, work directly for the Turkish\ngovernment and are not involved in governmental policy making positions. The Turkish\ngovernment is a U.S. ally with strong ties to the U.S. and other western countries.\nTurkey currently seeks admission to the European Union, another indicator of its strong\nties to the west. It is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of his foreign family members and the interests of the U.S. \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest) applies. Applicant clearly has a sense of loyalty and obligation to his\nfamily members in Turkey. However, he chose to move to and live in the U.S. He\nbecame a U.S. citizen and his wife plans to do the same. His most significant family\nmembers, his wife and son, reside in the U.S. While Applicant travels to Turkey to visit\nhis family members, his ties in the U.S. and his compliance with other federal\ngovernment agencies processes to handle sensitive information support the premise\nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interest.\n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation) is not applicable.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family members who live\nand reside in Turkey cannot be considered casual and infrequent. \nForeign Influence concerns are mitigated based on Applicant\u2019s longstanding ties\nto the U.S. Guideline B is found for Applicant.\n\n8\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG \u00b6 9:      \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.   \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise\nsecurity concerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a) (exercise\nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport and (2) military service or a willingness to bear\narms for a foreign country) applies. Applicant possessed a valid Turkish passport until\nMay 2007 when it expired. Whenever he traveled to Turkey prior to May 2007 and after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 2003, he used his Turkish passport instead of his U.S.\npassport. He also participated in military training and paid $7,000 as fulfillment of his\nmilitary obligation required of Turkish citizens under Turkish law. Use of a Turkish\npassport and completion of a foreign military obligation are considered an exercise of\nhis rights of foreign citizenship and raises a security concern under foreign preference.  \nIn addition, his decision to comply with the legal mandates of military service for\nTurkish citizens raised security concerns under FP DC 10 (c) (performing or attempting\nto perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve the interests of a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in conflict with the national security interest).\nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from Foreign Preference. The following Foreign Preference Mitigating\nConditions (FP MC) have the potential to apply in Applicant\u2019s case.\nFP MC \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\na foreign country) does not appy.\nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship) applies. Applicant stated in his interview, in his response to the SOR, and in\nhis response to the FORM that he is willing to renounce his Turkish citizenship, if\nnecessary. His decision two years ago to follow Turkish law regarding the military\nobligations of Turkish citizens reflects some level loyalty to Turkey. He made this\ndecision, in part, to please his mother. His reasoning for his decision lessens the level\nof his loyalty to Turkey.\nFP MC \u00b6 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual\nwas a minor) does not apply.  \n\n9\nFP MC \u00b6 11(d) (use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority) is not applicable to the facts of this case. \nFP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated) applies. Applicant did not renew his Turkish\npassport when it expired in May 2007. Two months later, he destroyed this passport in\nthe presence of his security officer. When he visits family members in Turkey, he uses\nhis U.S. passport to enter and exit Turkey, and intends to do so in the future.    \nFP MC \u00b6 11(f) (the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United\nStates Government) is not applicable because there is nothing in the record evidence\nsuggesting Applicant voted in a foreign election. \nApplicant mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns about use of his passport\nand his military service. While Applicant may still be a member of the Turkish military\nreserves, and as such could be called to active duty in the Turkish military, there is little\nlikelihood that future service in the Turkish military would be against the U.S. There is a\nmuch higher likelihood that any service in the Turkish military would be in conjunction\nwith the U.S. military operations against U.S. enemies as Turkey has strong ties to the\nU.S. Turkey is a U.S. ally in the war against terrorism. Guideline C is found for\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. After becoming a U.S. citizen,\nApplicant continued to travel on his Turkish passport when returning to Turkey to visit\nfamily members with whom he has strong ties. Two years ago, he complied with\nTurkey\u2019s laws on military service to please his mother. While these actions raises\n\n10\nsecurity concerns, the security concerns are mitigated by his decision to not renew his\nTurkish passport when it expired, to destroy it and to use his U.S. passport when\ntraveling to Turkey. The Turkish government has very strong ties to the U.S. and\nwestern Europe. Turkey supports the U.S. in the war on terrorism and is not likely to\ntake up arms against the U.S. The close relationship between the U.S. government and\nthe Turkish government favors granting the Applicant a trustworthiness determination\neven though he complied with Turkish law on military service. Applicant is willing to\nrenounce his Turkish citizenship, which also supports granting him a trustworthiness\ndetermination. His family members do not directly work for the Turkish government.\nRather, they work in non-policy civilian government positions, which are not likely to\ncreate conflict of interest issues for Applicant. His sister, who is a school teacher and\neducator, like many school teachers and educators in this country and countries around\nthe world, works for a governmental entity. The majority of educator jobs worldwide are\nfound in governmental agencies, as these agencies provide most of the educational\nresources. After weighing all these facts, I find that the weight of the facts favor a\nfinding in favor of Applicant on trustworthiness. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising under the foreign\ninfluence and foreign preference guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\n                                                     \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program,\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 22, 2008, admitting all of the allegations\nand requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on September 4, 2008. On\nSeptember 8, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for October\n3, 2008. During the hearing, I received two government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit,\nand Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on October 10, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the record evidence, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nNovember 25, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41-year-old, married woman with four children, ages sixteen,\nfifteen, four, and one. She earned a master\u2019s degree in international business in 1995\n(Tr. 15). Currently, she works for a defense contractor as a management consultant (Tr.\n15). According to her supervisor, she is a \u201cconscientious, honest, and loyal\u201d employee\n(Exhibit A). \nApplicant was born and raised in Senegal (Tr. 18). She emigrated to the United\nStates in 1987 when she was 20 years old, and became a naturalized citizen in 1993\n(Tr. 19). She has been married since 1991. She earned both her undergraduate and\ngraduate degrees in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s husband is a citizen of Cape Verde, a small country composed of\napproximately 10 islands located off the west coast of Africa (Tr. 92). He is an\neconomist (Tr. 79). From 1991 through approximately 1999, he worked for the Cape\nVerde embassy in the U.S. as a commercial attache (Answer at 1). Before then, he\nworked in the Cape Verde ministry of finance (Answer at 1). His work responsibilities at\nthese two jobs are unknown from the record.\nFrom 1999 to 2006, Applicant\u2019s husband worked for an African foreign aid and\ndevelopment bank (Tr. 40). Since then, he has served as president of a Cape Verde\ninvestment agency which is part of the Cape Verdian government. His current job at the\ninvestment agency and earlier job with the development bank both focused on providing\nassistance to the poor (Tr. 78).\nApplicant and her husband have not lived together since 1999, when he took the\njob with the African development bank. He visits her in the U.S. two to three times per\nyear. They communicate by phone or e-mail approximately once per week (Ex. 2 at 14).\nApplicant\u2019s husband lives in Cape Verde with his mother. He is seeking to gain a\njob in the U.S. in his field of expertise (Tr. 47). He wants to live in the U.S. with his\nfamily (Id.). He has an adult son from a prior relationship who lives in France (Tr. 50).\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with her husband\u2019s son are infrequent (Answer at 2).\nApplicant\u2019s mother has dual Senegalese and Cape Verdian citizenship (Answer\nat 2). She lives in Cape Verde where she owns and manages a restaurant (Tr. 98).\nApplicant speaks with her approximately once per month (Tr. 56, 98). Applicant\u2019s\nmother last visited her in the U.S. in 1998 (Tr. 90).\nIn 2000, Applicant and her husband lent her mother $30,000 (Tr. 29). She used it\nto purchase land in Cape Verde. Applicant has no interest in the property. Her mother\nhas satisfied approximately $18,000 of the loan (Tr. 32).\nApplicant maintains a savings account in Cape Verde (Answer at 3). The balance\nis approximately $18,000. Approximately $17,000 consists of money her mother\n\n3\nreimbursed her for the loan (Id.). Applicant and her husband have approximately\n$240,000 of savings and investments in various accounts in the U.S. (T. 21-22).\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a dual U.S. and Senegalese citizen living in Senegal. He\nmanages a restaurant his mother owns there. Applicant and her brother communicate\nby e-mail sporadically, and on birthdays and holidays (Tr. 98).\nApplicant\u2019s sister holds dual citizenship with Cape Verde and France. She lives\nwith her husband, a French native, in France. She is a homemaker (Tr. 60). Applicant\nspeaks with her by phone approximately once a month. Applicant traveled to France to\nvisit her sister once in 2004 and once in 2006 (Exhibit 2 at 12). \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Cape Verde (Tr. 66). She\nhas resident alien status with the U.S. (Tr. 95). They talk by phone once every few\nmonths (Tr. 93). Recently, in 2007, she visited Applicant in the U.S. to assist her in\ncaring for her newborn child (Tr. 95).\nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a citizen and resident of Cape Verde. She is a\npediatrician who works at a local hospital and at her own private clinic (Ex 2 at 11).\nThey talk approximately once or twice per year. She has U.S. resident alien status, and\nperiodically visits relatives in the U.S. Her last visit with Applicant in the U.S. occurred\napproximately 10 years ago (Tr. 95).\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Cape Verde. He works at a\nlocal bank (Exhibit 2 at 11). Applicant talks with him on birthdays and holidays (Tr. 96).\nApplicant\u2019s last two trips to Cape Verde occurred in 2002 (Tr. 71). She traveled to\nSenegal in December 1998 and December 2000 (Exhibit 2 at 12). Each trip lasted\napproximately one month. In 2004, Applicant visited her sister in France. Later, she\nvisited Tunisia where her husband was then living. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nan individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests\u201d (AG \u00b6\n6). Applicant\u2019s family and financial ties to Cape Verde, Senegal, and France raise the\nissues of whether AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business, or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d or 7(e),\n\u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation,\u201d apply.\nDepartment counsel correctly noted in her closing argument that friendly\ncountries may just as readily conduct espionage against the U.S. as hostile countries.\nThis observation alone does not establish a foreign influence security concern. Instead,\nit is one of several factors including whether the country is known to target U.S. citizens,\nwhether it is a stable democracy, and whether it is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nSuch an assessment of the \u201c\u2018geopolitical situation\u2019 and the \u2018security/intelligence profile\nof the country vis-a-vis the U.S.\u2019 is crucial in Guideline B cases\u201d (ISCR Case No 07-\n05686 (App. Bd., November 12, 2008 at 4). \nHere, the government presented no such information about Cape Verde, France,\nor Senegal. Consequently, I do not conclude that Applicant\u2019s contacts with relatives\nliving in these countries generates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply.\nConversely, Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s employment in Cape Verde, and her Cape\nVerdian bank account trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and 7(e). Applicant\u2019s\nhusband is dedicated to helping the poor in Cape Verde through economic\n\n5\ndevelopment. Before working with the Cape Verde investment agency, he worked for an\norganization dedicated to the economic development of the entire African continent.\nCape Verde, like any other country, may sometimes disagree with the U.S. on the\nmeans toward generating growth in the developing world; however, its ultimate goal -\nregional economic development - is not inimical to U.S. interests. Under these\ncircumstances, the position and activities of Applicant\u2019s husband within the Cape Verde\ngovernment \u201care such that it is unlikely that [she] will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment, and the interests of the U.S.\u201d (AG \u00b6 8(a)).\nAs for AG \u00b6 7(e), Applicant\u2019s Cape Verdian bank account constitutes less than\n7% of her net worth. The remainder is invested in various U.S. accounts. AG \u00b6 8(f) \u201cthe\nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such\nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure the individual,\u201d applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is a solid, respected employee within the company where she works.\nShe has lived in the U.S. for nearly her entire adult life, receiving both her\nundergraduate and master\u2019s degrees here. Upon considering this case in light of the\nwhole person concept, I conclude she has mitigated the security concern. Clearance is\ngranted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 7, 2008. She answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on July 21, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nMarch 10, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on August 21, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment on September 4, 2008. DOHA issued the first notice of hearing on October\n1, 2008 for a hearing date of October 16, 2008. Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a\ncontinuance on October 14, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay by Order\ndated October 14, 2008. DOHA issued a second hearing notice on November 10, 2008\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 9, 2008. The government\noffered 20 exhibits (GE) 1 through 20, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant and one witness testified on her behalf. She submitted 13\nexhibits (AE) A through M, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 30, 2008. I\nheld the record open until December 31, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional matters\nand until January 14, 2009 for Department Counsel to brief several legal issues. On\nDecember 30, 2008, Applicant submitted three additional documents through counsel,\nwhich were marked as AE N through P and admitted without objection. Department\nCounsel submitted a brief on January 14, 2009. Applicant did not file a response, which\nwas due January 26, 2009. The record closed on January 26, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated July 21, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.m of the SOR. She denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1,a-1.c, 1.e, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, and 2.a-2.d of the SOR.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 60-years-old, works for a Department of Defense contractor.\nShe began her current employment in January 2005 as an administrative assistant.

For the last 42 years, her husband has been self-employed,\nworking as a contractor in the construction industry.

Because her mother died in the state in which Applicant lived and owned a house in another\n5\nstate, the resolution of Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s estate was much more complicated. Applicant attempted twice\nto probate her mother\u2019s will without success. Tr. 65-67.\nGE 1; Tr. 24.\n6\nTr. 32, 102, 110.\n7\n3\nApplicant remained at home with her children, whom she home schooled. From 1987\nuntil 2002, she lived on a 30-acre farm in a rural area of the country.3\nIn 1997, after Applicant\u2019s stepfather died, she moved her seriously ill mother to\nher farm so that she could care for her. Her mother suffered from multiple medical\nproblems and died five months later on October 31, 1997. Her mother\u2019s medical care\nresulted in numerous expenses, most of which Applicant charged on her mother\u2019s credit\ncard pursuant to power of attorney, and for which her mother\u2019s estate lacked the cash to\npay. Applicant paid these bills for several years until she could not longer pay her\nmother\u2019s debts.  \n4\nUpon her mother\u2019s death and pursuant to her mother\u2019s will, Applicant, an only\nchild, and her seven children inherited her parent\u2019s home in another state. Applicant\nalso received $3,000 from a life insurance policy. Applicant did not probate her mother\u2019s\nwill, although she twice attempted to do so.5\nIn 1999, Applicant and her husband began living apart. She remained on their\nfarm with some of their children and he moved into her parents\u2019 home in another state,\ncontinuing to work in the construction industry as a contractor. Over the next three\nyears, she worked sporadically in the restaurant industry. In 2002, she moved into her\nparents\u2019 home with her husband and began working, initially part-time.6\nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s husband, who is now 62 years old, suffered a heart attack.\nSince his heart attack, the doctor\u2019s have placed stints in his arteries. In 2007, he was\nhospitalized for bleeding ulcers. He also suffers from diabetes. His ability to work is\nmore limited because of his health problems.7\nApplicant\u2019s tax returns reflect she and her husband\u2019s gross income as follows:\n$48,087 for 1999, $10,423 for 2001, $2,432 for 2002, $14,890 for 2003, $18,565 for\n2004, $30,723 for 2005, $47,000 for 2006, and $26,126 for 2007. After moving into her\nparents\u2019 home, Applicant found it difficult to pay household expenses on two properties\nwith her part-time job and her husband\u2019s fluctuating income. She could not pay the\nproperty taxes on her parents\u2019 home. As a consequence, the State sold the house. The\nholder of the tax sale certificate moved to foreclose on the property in 2003. Because\nshe wanted to retain possession of her parents\u2019 home, Applicant sought legal counsel.\n\nGE 2 (Attachments including letter from attorney); GE 5 (bankruptcy petition); AE P (tax returns); Tr. 24, 29-\n8\n20.\nGE 5 (Bankruptcy petition).\n9\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and answer with attachments, including docket sheet for Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy case);\n10\nGE 3.\nGE 2, attachments; Tr. 66.\n11\n4\nHer attorney advised her to file bankruptcy and to probate her mother\u2019s will. She hired\nan attorney to handle the bankruptcy action and another attorney to resolve her\nmother\u2019s estate issues. On the recommendation of legal counsel, in April 2004,\nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition for the sole purpose of stopping the\nforeclosure on her parents\u2019 house. 8\nThe Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition listed the farm, and her parents\u2019 house as\nApplicant\u2019s real property with a total value of $37,500, and personal property, including\nan old car, with a total value of $1,750. Applicant identified her secured creditors as the\ntax certificate holder, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the holder of the car note,\nand her unsecured creditors as several credit card holders. One judgment was listed.\nSeveral of the debts listed are from her mother\u2019s estate.9\nThe bankruptcy court docket sheet reveals that creditors were notified and that\nonly one creditor responded. Following a hearing in June 2004, Applicant developed a\nrepayment plan, which required her to pay $95 for four months, and then $403 a month\nfor 56 months. After a hearing in August 2004, the court confirmed the plan in an Order\ndated October 21, 2004. The bankruptcy court records indicate Applicant made some\npayments under the plan. In June 2006, through counsel, Applicant filed a motion to\nacquire post-petition debt. One month later, a certificate of consent related to this\nmotion was filed with the court. On July 27, 2006, the bankruptcy court entered an order\napproving the settlement and granting the relief requested by the above motion. Three\nmonths later the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13\ncase, which the court granted on November 1, 2006. The bankruptcy court did not\ndismiss Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 petition for Applicant\u2019s failure to appear for the creditors\nmeeting or for failure to comply with terms of her repayment plan. Rather, the court\ndismissed this case based on an approved settlement agreement. The terms of the\nsettlement agreement have not been submitted into this record.10\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney advised that he recommended Applicant file a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure on her parents\u2019 home and to place this\nproperty in her mother\u2019s estate, goals which were achieved. Through appropriate legal\nprocess, Applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 home became part of her mother\u2019s estate and title\ntransferred to Applicant as her mother\u2019s sole heir, subsequent to Applicant\u2019s children\nagreement to relinquish any rights to the property.11\n\nGE 2 at 25.\n12\nGE 2, attachments; Tr. 54, 85-89.\n13\nAE A; Tr. 84.\n14\n5\nApplicant applied for a $120,000 mortgage in 2006, which was approved. To\nactually receive her funds, the mortgagor required Applicant to dismiss her Chapter 13\nbankruptcy, which the court did on November 1, 2006. Applicant proceeded to\nsettlement on December 15, 2006. The settlement funds included disbursements to pay\ntaxes, including the $16,409 IRS lien, the judgment listed in her bankruptcy, attorneys\u2019\nfees, and $4,500 to an individual Applicant believes resolved the remaining credit card\ndebt in the bankruptcy. Her attorney advised that the bankruptcy included\nmiscellaneous credit card debt he believed was owed by Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s estate\nand that since the creditors for the bank credit cards did not file a claim, it was\nunnecessary to pay the claims. He also advised that all claims were paid, although full\ndocumentation on this issue is not of record.   \n12\nApplicant\u2019s current annual income is $63,150. Her gross monthly income is\napproximately $5,250 and her net income is approximately $3,400 a month. Because of\nhis health and the slowdown in the economy, especially the construction industry,\nApplicant\u2019s husband contributed $400 to the family income in December 2008, although\nthis amount has been much higher in other months. She depends on her husband\u2019s\nmonthly contribution to pay household expenses. Her fixed monthly household\nexpenses include $1,429 for the mortgage, $400 for electric, $40 for water, $96 for TV\nhookup, $42 for the internet, and $800 for car insurance. Other household expenses\naverage around $1,000. These expenses can fluctuate and include food, gasoline, and\nmiscellaneous expenses. Her February 2008 financial statement reflects that she\ngenerally has sufficient income to meet her monthly expenses and her credit report\nreflects that she does not use credit cards to pay monthly expenses. Two sons live with\nher, but do not contribute significantly to the household expenses. Over the last 42\nyears, payment of household expenses has always been a challenge to Applicant and\nher husband.13\nIn January 2008, Applicant wrote her mortgage holder advising that she had\nencountered unexpected and high expenses. She asked for assistance based on\nhardship. Her mortgage holder worked with her. As a result, her mortgage payments\nactually decreased about $100 a month. To assure that she has sufficient money each\nmonth to pay her mortgage, Applicant has a separate checking account for her\nmortgage. Each pay check, she deposits one-half of the mortgage into this account.\nAlthough she has been late, she pays the mortgage each month.  \n14\nThe SOR lists 13 debts which raised a security concern for Applicant. Two debts\nbelong to her mother\u2019s estate, three debts are paid or resolved, two debts have a zero\nbalance, and tow debts are not Applicant\u2019s. The debts are outlined in the following table:\n\nApplicant admitted owing this debt in her response to the SOR because she had paid it for her mother for\n15\nseveral years.

She used her mother\u2019s\ncredit cards to pay for her mother\u2019s medical expenses. After her mother died, she paid\non these debts until she could no longer pay the monthly bills. The two credit cards\nidentified in SOR allegations 1.m. and 1.n are not listed on any of Applicant\u2019s credit\nreports.  These two debts are listed in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition with partial\n15\naccounts numbers which do not match any account numbers on her credit reports.\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports contain the two credit card debts listed in SOR allegations 1.d\nand 1.g. The reports show a zero balance and indicate the accounts have been\ntransferred or are a sold, charged off account. The credit reports do not reflect a new\nholder of these accounts. In addition, the April 7, 2006 and May 27, 2008 credit reports\nshow a third account with the same creditor, noting that the account is part of a Chapter\n13 wage earner\u2019s plan and has a zero balance.   \n16\n\nTr. 40, 41, 107.\n17\nTr. 32, 39-40, 70-72, 112-113, 119.\n18\nGE 1, at 1, 10-11.\n19\n7\nApplicant disagrees with the two debts listed in SOR allegations in 1.j and 1.l, but\nshe has not filed a formal complaint with the credit reporting companies or with the\ncreditors. She told the investigator she would pay these debts and again, at the hearing,\nstated she would pay the debts under protest as she does not believe she owes the\nmoney. Applicant continues to insure her cars with the insurer listed in SOR allegation\n1.k. To keep her insurance, she needed to pay her overdue balance. She has not\nprovided documentation to show she does not owe this creditor.17\nApplicant and her husband recently decided to sell the farm as they cannot afford\nthe cost of it. They have talked with a realtor, but have not signed a sales contract. They\nstill owe a small amount of money on the mortgage and the property taxes of $300 for\n2008. The mortgagor is working with them. Applicant now manages the household\nfinances. Her husband did in the past and did not always keep her informed of the\nstatus of the debts. As a self- employed individual, Applicant\u2019s husband had no benefits,\nsuch as medical insurance or disability insurance. In the past, she did the family taxes.\nAs a result of the tax lien for 1999 taxes, Applicant hired an accountant to review her tax\npreparation and filings for every year from 1999 forward and to prepare and file her\nyearly tax returns. She has always filed her federal and state tax returns. She and her\nhusband took their first vacation recently. They flew to a distant state to visit a\ndaughter.18\nOn March 27, 2006, Applicant completed her security clearance application. She\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d and listed one debt to the following question in her SF-86:19\nQuestion 28a. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 days\nIn the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\nWhen she answered this question, Applicant listed one judgment, but did not list\nthe debts identified in SOR allegations 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n. She also listed her\nbankruptcy.\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the following questions in her SF-86:\nQuestion 28b. Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt?\nQuestion 27c. Your Financial Record\n\nId. at 26-27, 29-31. SOR alleges she falsified this answer when she did not list her October 2000\n20\nmisdemeanor charge for driving on a suspended operator\u2019s license, her December 2000 charge for failure to\nappear, and a January 2003 speeding ticket and driving on a suspended license. \nGEs 6-8; GEs 13-18; GE 20; AE P; Tr. 60-62, 107, 117.\n21\nTr. 105-106.\n22\n8\nIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your\nproperty for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\nConcerning Section 23, Her Police Record, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all six\nquestions about past arrests.20\nApplicant strenuously denied that she deliberately omitted information on her\nsecurity clearance application. She has little memory of being arrested for anything. She\ndid not list any traffic offenses when answering Question 23. She believed the omitted\noffenses were traffic misdemeanors, and did not think they constituted criminal conduct.\nEach traffic offense fine was less than $150 although the fine plus court costs was $243\nfor a 2003 offense. She did not list the tax lien filed by the IRS. She acknowledged that\nin 2003, she learned about the tax lien, which the IRS filed against her farm, not the\nhouse in which she lived. She did not think about the lien, in part because the lien had\nbeen filed against the farm and in part because she thought it was being resolved by\nher bankruptcy. Two of the debts not listed are debts directly related to her mother, and\nare debts which she does not consider hers. She did not know about the $768\njudgment, as this debt belonged to her husband\u2019s business. She listed the dental bill as\nthe judgment. She acknowledged the library fine to the investigator, which is not listed in\nany of the credit reports or her bankruptcy petition. She did not list the 1995 judgment\nfor a medical bill. The most recent credit report and the Lexis-Nexis judgment\ninformation sheets do not reflect that her tax liens were paid in January 2007 and\nreleased by the IRS in April 2008. The credit reports also show a judgment which does\nnot belong to her and do not reflect the 1995 judgment.21\nApplicant understood that if she lied on her security clearance application she\nwould lose her job. She denied she would lie and omit material facts purposely or\nknowingly. She admits she made big mistakes in responding to the questions. She filled\nout the form to the best of her abilities. In hindsight, she should have talked with\nsomeone, \u201cgotten\u201d advice, and \u201cgotten\u201d a credit report before completing her application.\nApplicant was not the best historian at the hearing, in part due to nervousness.22\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n23\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . . give any\n9\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n23\n\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of \u201cthe administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself.

This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\n\n11\nsome obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ This mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant and her\nhusband have always had financial problems because he was self-employed in the\nconstruction industry, an industry where work is directly impacted by the ups and downs\nof the economy. In 2002, her husband suffered a heart attack, which kept him out of\nwork for some time. When he did not work, her husband did not earn money. He did not\nhave disability income. In 2007, their household income was again adversely affected\nby her husband\u2019s health issues. As recommended by her attorney, Applicant filed\nbankruptcy to stop the foreclosure on her parents\u2019 house. During this process,\nApplicant\u2019s attorney probated her mother\u2019s will and succeeded in transferring the house\nfrom her mother\u2019s estate into Applicant\u2019s name. Once this occurred, Applicant applied\nfor, then qualified for a mortgage, which she received on the condition she dismiss the\nChapter 13 bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court approved these actions and following the\ndismissal of the bankruptcy, she closed on her mortgage in December 2006. She used\nthe proceeds from the mortgage to pay her federal tax lien, the lien holder on the house,\nthe judgment listed in her bankruptcy, and several other debts. When she experienced a\nfinancial downturn and increased expenses in late 2007, she wrote the mortgagor,\nasking for assistance. The mortgagor worked with her to resolve the problem. Currently,\nshe is working with the mortgagor on the farm loan and has made contact with a broker\nto try and sell the farm in a poor real estate market. She has not ignored her debts,\nrather she has taken action to resolve her issues to the best of her ability. She acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. I find this potentially mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received financial\ncounseling. However, many of the financial issues raised in the SOR have been\nresolved and her current finances are being managed. She continues to have limited\nfunds because her husband is unable to work regularly for health reasons and because\nhis work has been directly impacted by the economy. She does not use credit cards to\nfinance a life style, but lives within her financial means. Her credit reports support her\n\nDepartment counsel argues that because Applicant has not received credit counseling, AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot\n24\nbe considered a mitigating condition. Applicant has not ignored her debts. She has taken responsibility for the\nlarge debt issues and successfully resolved many of these debts. She continues to take responsibility for\nresolving financial issues within her limited resources. Credit counseling would not necessarily resolve the\nissues in this case. Moreover, most people receive some credit counseling in connection with bankruptcy.\nFinally, her experiences resolving her debts has given her a good understanding of budgeting and other\nfinancial fundmentals.\n12\nstatement that she does not use credit to finance an unafforable lifestyle. This mitigating\ncondition has some applicability.24\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant began\nworking with her attorney in 2004 to resolve the financial issues caused by her mother\u2019s\nhealth and related financial problems. Upon the recommendation of her attorney, she\nfiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure on her parents\u2019 house. Two and\none-half years after filing her bankruptcy petition, the court dismissed her case after\napproving a settlement which allowed Applicant to acquire a mortgage. Applicant used\nthe mortgage proceeds to pay debts, including paying $4,500 to an individual who was\nresolving credit card debt. Her recent credit reports indicate that the two small credit\ncard debts have a zero balance. The credit reports indicate the accounts were sold or\ntransferred, but the credit reports do not show the debts are held by another creditor. I\nfind that since these debts were listed in her bankruptcy and she paid funds out of her\nmortgage settlement for resolution of the credit card debts, these debts have been\nresolved. As Applicant\u2019s credit reports contain many inaccuracies concerning the\nresolution of debt, this is a reasonable conclusion in light of all the information in the\nrecord. This mitigating condition has partial applicability.\nAlthough Applicant denies that she owes the two small debts identified in SOR\nallegations 1.l and 1.j, she has not formally challenged the validity of these debts with\nthe creditor or the credit reporting companies. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. AG \u00b6\n20(f) is not applicable in this case.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n25\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nIntention is defined as \u201ca determination to act in a certain way\u201d and intentional is defined as \u201cdone by\n26\nintention or design\u201d. Merriam-W ebster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (11  ed. 2003).\nth\n13\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from her e-QIP when she\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 27c about the tax lien on her farm, to Question 23 about her\nmisdemeanor traffic offenses and Question 28b about her current financial\ndelinquencies. She answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 28a, but did not list all her debts. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to her honesty. She strongly denies, however, that she deliberately\nfalsified her answers. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government\nhas the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or\nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the\n25\ngovernment must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her\nanswers was deliberate and intentional.26\nApplicant reasonably believed that the traffic citations and arrests were motor\nvehicle violations and not criminal conduct, a belief held by many other individuals in\nthis country. Applicant admits that she learned about the tax lien on the farm in 2003\nand she listed the tax lien on her Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. This knowledge by\nitself does not make her \u201cno\u201d answer intentional. She acknowledged her bankruptcy\nfiling and a judgment on her security clearance application. By providing this\ninformation, Applicant was not attempting to hide her financial problems from the\ngovernment. Her disclosure highlights the financial issues as a potential security\nconcern. She, however, did not provide accurate and complete information, which does\nnot equal intentional falsification. There is no evidence in the record which indicates that\nshe decided not reveal this information. Given that she provided negative information\n\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating condition\n27\nAG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the\nallegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n14\nabout her finances, her failure to list the other negative financial information was not\ndeliberate and intentional. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.27\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both good\nand bad. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record, not\na single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is shown. A determination\non an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as punishment\nfor specific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence\nof record to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security\nconcern.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have considered all the facts and\nevidence in the record, even if not specifically enumerated. Applicant married young\nand has seven children. Over the last 42 years, she and her husband have struggled\nfinancially. Because he worked in the construction industry, his income was directly\nimpacted by economic good times and bad times. Applicant and her husband have not\nlived extravagantly. They struggled to pay ordinary living expense, such as housing and\nfood for their children. Their life continues to be adversely affected by the economy and\ntheir ability to pay their usual living expenses is less than it would be in a strong\neconomy. They do not use credit cards to finance a lavish or extravagant lifestyle. They\ndo not have a car payment, only a mortgage payment. In the last five years, Applicant\nhas worked to resolve several large debts issues. Her employment is steady and\n\nThe other documentation of debt are printouts of information from Lexus-Nexus on judgments and liens.\n28\nThese documents are not the court record, but simply information inputted into a computer by some source.\nThe record does not contain any information which shows that this information is regularly updated. The court\nrecord is the most reliable source as to the validity of the judgments and liens and the current status.\n15\nreliable, unlike her husband\u2019s business. However, her income does not provide her with\nsufficient money to pay all the bills. She still relies on her husband to provide income to\nmeet all the household expenses. Over the last five years, she has established a track\nrecord for attacking and resolving her debt issues. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The fluctuation in her husband\u2019s income places challenges on\nher ability to always keep current on her bills and to meet unexpected expenses. She\ndoes not ignore her bills, she pays them as soon as she can.\nThe credit reports of record reflect that she does not live beyond her financial\nmeans. The credit reports and other documentation of debt owed contained inaccurate\ninformation about her debt payments and actual debts.  A careful review of these\n28\nrecords supports Applicant\u2019s statements about her use of credit cards. The largest credit\ncard debt listed in the SOR (1.n) and another debt (1.m) are not shown as her personal\ndebts on any credit report. Because these debts are not listed as hers and her attorney\nconsidered the debts an estate debt, her testimony that the debt belonged to her mother\nis credible. She used the credit cards pursuant to the power of attorney her mother had\ngiven her. Several smaller debts remain unpaid. These debts cannot be a source of\nimproper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts\nare paidBit is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to\nhold a security clearance. While some debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise\nsecurity concerns. For many years, she and her husband have struggled to provide for\ntheir large family. They have never resorted to illegal actions to do so. There is very little\nlikelihood she would do so in the future. I find that overall the positive factors in this\ncase outweigh the negative factors in this case.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n16\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On April 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 22, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil July 11, 2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information.

She has two and a half years of college in the area of \nadministration and accounting. She has two adult children, ages 34 and 32. She has \nbeen married several times. She married her last husband in 2000. He died in \nNovember 2003, leaving her with $16,000 of financial obligations and insufficient funds \nto pay the debt. (Tr. 36; 71).  \n \n \nApplicant began her current position with a federal contractor in January 2007. \nShe is an administrative assistant to a vice-president of the company. About three \nweeks ago, she started a part-time job to supplement her income. (Tr. 61). Prior to her \nposition with the federal contractor, she worked for various companies. She did not work \nfrom September 2001 to August 2004, while she was married to her last husband and \nsubsequent to his death. Other than that time period, she worked most of her life. (Tr. \n21-23). \n \n \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in 1986 that continued until she \nmarried her last husband in 2000.  During those fourteen years, she accrued significant \nfinancial obligations because she exercised poor judgment while in various \nrelationships. (Tr. 71-72). In March 2002, she filed a Petition for a Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy. In June 2002, the court entered an order, discharging approximately \n$24,824 in debt. After the discharge, she was in \u201ca good financial place.\u201d (Tr. 37).  \nHowever, subsequent to that discharge, she again began accumulating delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. 37).  \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant completed a SF-86. In response to questions about her \nfinances, she acknowledged that she had filed a petition for bankruptcy within the past \nseven years and had an automobile repossessed. She noted that she was not sure of \nthe status of her financial delinquencies. Under the heading, \u201cAdditional Comments,\u201d \nshe wrote, \u201cMy credit is not good.  I\u2019m in the process of cleaning up my credit.\u201d (GE 1 at \n35). \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nIn January 2008, the Government sent Applicant a set of Interrogatories inquiring \nabout thirteen delinquent debts and one judgment in follow-up to the SF-86. When she \nreturned the document, she included a copy of her budget, which is current, with some \nmodifications because of her new part-time position. Her net monthly income is about \n$1,600. Her expenses are about $857, leaving a net remainder of about $750 a month \nfor other expenditures.  (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 61).  Last year, she started becoming more \nfinancially solvent. (Tr. 73). \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CRB) from March 27, 2008, November 2007 and \nJuly 2007, the SOR alleged eleven delinquent debts, totaling $16,607. (GE 3, 4 & 5). All \nof those debts were the subject of the Government\u2019s January 2008 Interrogatories. The \nstatus of those debts is as follows: \n \n \n1. Applicant asserted that she has no knowledge of five delinquent debts \nbecause she never had accounts with those creditors: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j.  \nShe has not done anything to investigate the debts in order to have them removed from \nher credit history.  \n \n \n2. One debt was resolved in the 2002 bankruptcy: \u00b6 1.h. \n \n \n3. Applicant admitted having knowledge of five debts in the SOR:  \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.e, 1.f, and 1.k. She had accounts for her husband\u2019s estate with the creditors listed in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  She called the creditors a few times after her husband\u2019s death in \nNovember 2003 to inquire about the debts. Other than those phone calls, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve \nnot taken time, which I know that\u2019s really a problem. I haven\u2019t taken time to do a letter, \nand like you said, maybe called \u2013 go set up an appointment to go in and talk to talk to \nthem.\u201d (Tr. 58). She thinks that the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.e may be the balance owed on an \nautomobile loan that she \u201ccould have\u201d co-signed for her roommate. (Tr. 45-48). It \nremains unpaid or unresolved. She disputes the $9,287 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nrelating to an automobile repossession, and believes the amount is $4,000. She has not \ntaken any steps to resolve it.  \u201cTruthfully, I\u2019ve not done anything.\u201d (Tr. 58).  SOR \u00b6 1.k \nalleges an unpaid 2002 judgment for $1,650, which arose after she was evicted from an \napartment.  She disagrees with the amount, but has not taken steps to resolve the \nmatter. \n \n \nApplicant submitted her 2007/2008 Annual Performance Evaluation. According to \nher supervisor, Applicant\u2019s over-all performance summary is \u201cMeets Expectations Plus.\u201d  \n(AE A).  Applicant reviewed the evaluation and noted that she felt \u201cvery fortunate to \nhave the opportunity to work in the [division]. (Id.). \n \n \nOn July 9, 2008, Applicant hired a law firm to \u201chelp me clear my credit report and \nnegotiate settlements with the verified creditors.\u201d (AE D and E).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns, two of \nwhich may be applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201can inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant began \naccumulating delinquent debt in 1986, some of which was not resolved until 2002 when \nshe filed bankruptcy. Subsequent to the discharge of about $24,000, she accrued \nadditional delinquent debts that she did not pay or resolve.  The evidence is sufficient to \nraise those two potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n  \n Applicant=s financial problems started in 1986, and have essentially continued \ninto the present, except for a brief period in 2002 when she discharged many debts \nthrough a bankruptcy. Because the problems have been ongoing for many years, they \nreflect on her reliability and judgment. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \nApplicant attributed her financial issues to previous relationship problems and \nexercising poor judgment while in the relationships. Those were situations under her \ncontrol, and consequently, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nOn April 3, 2008, DOHA issued a SOR to Applicant, notifying her of the \ndelinquent debts that were a concern to the Government. As of the hearing on June 25, \n2008, she had not taken any steps to resolve ten of the eleven delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR. (One debt was previously resolved in a 2002 bankruptcy.) She submitted a \ncopy of her budget that indicates she has some money at the end of the month that she \ncould use to pay or resolve those outstanding financial obligations. On July 9, 2008, she \nentered into an agreement with a law firm to begin investigation of those issues. While \nthe execution of that agreement is an affirmative step in managing her finances, it is not \nsufficient evidence that her problems are under control, as required under AG \u00b6 20(c).  \n \nThroughout the security clearance process, Applicant admitted that she had \ncredit problems that she wanted to resolve. Despite her consistent acknowledgement of \nthose issues, she just recently executed an agreement to begin the process of resolving \nher credit problems. Because Applicant waited over a year to initiate action to resolve \nher debts, and as of today not one of the ten outstanding debts has been resolved or \npaid, her recent action cannot be construed as a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to pay or resolve her \nover-due debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nAlthough Applicant disputes several debts, she did not present any evidence to \nsupport the application of AG \u00b6 20(e). AG \u00b6 20(f) does not apply.   \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 51-year-old woman, \nwho candidly acknowledged that her financial difficulties for many years were the result \nof poor relationship choices and money management issues. In 2002, she filed \nbankruptcy to discharge about $24,000 of debt. Since that discharge, she again began \naccumulating debts that she chose not to manage or resolve. \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant completed a SF-86. In it she acknowledged that she had \nfinancial issues and that she \u201cwas in the process of cleaning up\u201d her credit. In January \n2008, the Government inquired about thirteen debts that were delinquent. In April 2008, \nthe Government alleged eleven of those debts in a SOR and placed her on notice that \nher finances could effect her employment. In May 2008, Applicant answered the SOR \nand requested a hearing. On June 25, 2008, the hearing was held. At the time of the \nhearing, only one of the eleven debts was resolved or paid, despite her previous \nstatement that she was working on the credit problems. On July 9, 2008, she decided to \nseek professional help.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to employ the assistance of a law firm to resolve her issues \nis a positive step in achieving financial stability. However, failing to initiate that step until \nvery recently indicates an on-going lack of commitment to manage her financial \nobligations and demonstrates unreliability. Until she resolves her delinquent debts and \nestablishes a solid budget and track record of fiscal responsibility, similar problems may \nrecur in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i through 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Copes, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his financial issues \nand personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn April 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 29, 2008, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. It is unclear when Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was received by DOHA. On June 18, 2008, Department Counsel requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Paragraph (\u00b6) E3.1.7 of the Directive provides \nNovember 5, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nthat Department Counsel has 20 days from receipt of Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR to \nrequest a hearing. Applicant was informed at the hearing that Department Counsel may \nhave requested a hearing more than 20 days after receipt of his answer. He \naffirmatively waived the issue and did not object to his case being handled at a \nhearing.1  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 27, 2008, scheduling the hearing for September 15, 2008. On \nSeptember 11, 2008, the hearing was cancelled because of the threat of severe \nweather. Another notice of hearing was issued on September 22, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on October 9, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were received without objection. The Government also offered an SOR \nDebt Summary chart as a form of demonstrative evidence. The chart is marked Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I and it was accepted for that limited purpose. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf but did not submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on October 16, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since about May 2005. He is a high school graduate. He served in \nthe U.S. Army from 1989 to 1992. He is married with three children, ages seven, four, \nand two.2  \n \n \nThe SOR lists 15 debts. Applicant admitted to owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.e, 1.f, and 1.i. He admitted to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.n, but indicated the debts were \nduplicates of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f. He admitted to SOR \u00b6 1.m, but provided \ninformation to dispute the debt. He denied the remaining allegations. Individual debts \nare addressed below. \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the medical debt of $802, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In \nhis answer to the SOR, he stated that he contacted the creditor more than a year before \nthe answer to work out a payment plan and was told they could not find his file. He \nstated that he would immediately re-contact the creditor and settle the debt. He has not \nmade any payments on the debt. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n is a duplicate of the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.3 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the medical debts of $5,633 and $944, as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He stated that he did not know what the debts were for, but he thought \nthe $5,633 debt may have been for the birth of one of his children. The credit reports \nthat list these debts do not identify a creditor. They simply list them as \u201cmedical.\u201d In the \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 6. \n \n2 Tr. at 24-25; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 30, 34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nabsence of additional information, there is insufficient evidence to find that Applicant is \nresponsible for these debts.4 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt of $370 to a collection company on behalf of a \ncellular telephone services company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He stated that he called \nthe telephone company in about August 2008, to dispute the account. He did not \nprovide any documentation in support of the dispute. The debt is listed on all the credit \nreports in evidence.5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $4,853 debt to a collection company, on behalf of a \nfinancial institution, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he \nmade attempts to settle the debt and was continuing to work with the creditor to resolve \nthe issue. He has not made any payments on the debt. At the hearing he stated that he \nnever had any dealings with the financial institution named in the SOR.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g allege delinquent debts of $1,371 and $2,501 to the same \nbank. Applicant admitted owing both debts, but stated that he believed they were \nduplicates and represented the same debt. He stated that he had one account with the \nbank about eight to ten years ago and that the debt resulted from when he was laid off \nwork. He further stated that when he tried to work out a payment plan, the creditor was \n\u201crude and threatening toward [him],\u201d and called a former employer and told the \nemployer that he was a \u201ccrappy human being.\u201d At the hearing Applicant identified the \nformer employer that was contacted. He listed on his Questionnaire for Sensitive \nPositions (SF 86), that he worked for this employer between September 1999 and July \n2001, and again between October 2002 and May 2005. Both debts, with different \naccount numbers, are listed on all the credit reports in evidence. The date of last action \nfor the debts is listed on the reports as between November 2001 and May 2002.7 I find \nthat Applicant is responsible for both debts. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt of $1,978 to a collection company on behalf of a \nfinancial institution, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He stated that he did not know what the \ndebt was, but that he would look into it and if it was legitimately his, then he would settle \nthe debt. He did not provide any documentation in support of the dispute. The debt is \nlisted on all the credit reports in evidence.8 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a delinquent debt of $604 to a collection company. Applicant \nadmitted owing this debt. The same debt is also listed in SOR \u00b6 1.o as a debt of $358 to \na different collection company. The difference in amounts is apparently due to accrued \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n5 Tr. at 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n6 Tr. at 30-31, 36, 37, 51-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n7 Tr. at 31-33, 52-53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \ninterest or penalties. The debt was apparently transferred or sold to the company \nnamed in SOR \u00b6 1.i, as the company in SOR \u00b6 1.o does not appear on the later two \nreports, but the company named in SOR \u00b6 1.i appears on all the reports. Applicant \ndenied owing the debt. He stated that he called the collection company named in SOR \u00b6 \n1.o, in about August 2008, to dispute the account, but was given the \u201crunaround.\u201d They \nfinally told him that they would investigate the debt and send him a response via e-mail. \nHe has not received a response. I find that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o is a duplicate of the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant has not made any payments on the debt which he admitted \nwas his responsibility.9 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt of $179 to a collection company on behalf of a \ntelephone services company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. A debt of $28 to the same \ncollection company on behalf of the same telephone services company is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant stated that he never had any dealings with this telephone \ncompany. He called the telephone company in about August 2008, and they told him \nthey had no record of his account. He also stated that he disputed the account on-line \nwith the credit reporting agencies. The debts are listed on the March 14, 2007 credit \nreport indicating the last action on the debts was in 2000. The debts are not listed on \nthe later two reports.10 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a delinquent debt of $1,096 to a collection company for a \nmedical debt. Applicant denied owing this debt. The debt is not listed on the two most \nrecent credit reports.11 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the debt of $8,421, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, but provided \nadditional information to suggest that he was not responsible for the debt. He stated that \nhe bought a truck in about 2001, and the next day the engine blew. The dealer replaced \nthe engine but it stopped working about a week later. After further attempts to resolve \nthe issue, he returned the truck. He stated that he never heard back from them. The \ndebt is not listed on the two most recent credit reports.12 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a series of low-paying jobs between \n1998 and 2000, and that he did not get back on his feet until 2005. He stated that the \ndebts were accrued eight or more years ago. He has not made payments on any of the \ndebts in the SOR. When asked why, he responded \u201cI have no excuse for it.\u201d He stated \nthat he has been traveling for work for large periods of time since he received the SOR. \nHe has never received financial counseling. Applicant earns about $65,500 annually \nand his wife earns about $6,000 a year working part-time. He has a surplus of about \n$400 to $500 per month, after paying his monthly expenses. He stated that he will pay \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 29, 33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n10 Tr. at 26-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n11 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n12 Tr. at 33-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nthe debts that he acknowledges are his responsibility or are proven to be his \nresponsibility.13 \n \n \nApplicant submitted an SF 86, certified as true on February 9, 2007. Question \n28A asked, \u201cLast 7 yrs, over 180 days delinquent on any debts?\u201d Question 28B asked, \n\u201cCurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debts?\u201d He answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. \nHe was questioned by an investigator for his background investigation on two occasions \nsometime after he submitted his SF 86. He testified that he did not remember if they \ndiscussed his delinquent debts.14  \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He stated that he \u201cwas \nunaware or had forgotten about these debts.\u201d He stated that he was given a very short \ntime to complete that application and he was under the impression that he had no \noutstanding debts that were under seven years old.15 I find that Applicant had \ndelinquent debts that were less than seven years old when he submitted the SF 86. I \nfurther find that Applicant knew this fact when he certified the SF 86 as true. After \nconsidering all the evidence, observing Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and gauging his \ncredibility, I find that he intentionally falsified his responses to Questions 28A and 28B of \nthe SF 86 by failing to list his delinquent debts. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 38-49. \n \n14 Tr. at 49-50; GE 1. \n \n15 Tr. at 45-46, 53-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments on any of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not applicable. He attributed his financial problems to low-paying jobs in about \n1998 to 2000. These are conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant started working for his current employer in 2005, and that is \nwhen he indicated that he was back on his feet financially. He has not made an effort to \npay his delinquent debts since then. There is insufficient information for a finding that he \nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.   \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. There are not clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. He \nhas not made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. \n \nApplicant disputed owing several debts. He did not provide documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute. However, several of the debts he disputed are not \nlisted on the most recent credit reports. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in 2007. The above disqualifying \ncondition has been established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nI have considered all the potential mitigating conditions. Applicant submitted his \nSF 86 in 2007. He denied falsifying his SF 86, but I did not find his testimony credible. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient credible information to establish any of the \nmitigating conditions. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice to our country. However, he has allowed debts to go unpaid for years without \nany effort at addressing them and he intentionally provided false information about his \nfinances on his SF 86.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 20, 2008.

DOHA received the request on March 10, 2008. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on March 20, 2008, and I received the case assignment on March\n20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on May 1, 2008. The government offered four exhibits, (GE) 1\nthrough 4, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\nand one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted 17 exhibits, (AE) A through Q,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008. The record closed on May 1, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 6, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.b of the SOR, with explanation. He denied the remaining factual\nallegations of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.   \n1\nApplicant graduated from high school, then enlisted in the United States Air\nForce. Four years later, he received an honorable discharge. Following his discharge,\nhe worked as a plumber for several years. He also received an associates degree in\narchitectural drafting. For the last 10 years, he has worked as an architectural\ndraftsman. He began work for his current employer, a federal contractor, in August\n1998.  \n2\nApplicant met his wife while serving in the military. They married in 1994. They\nhave three sons, ages 16, 9 and 3. The oldest son is Applicant\u2019s stepson.3\nFollowing the birth of their second son, Applicant\u2019s wife quit her job at a credit\nunion to remain home and care for their new son. She accepted employment with a\nnewspaper, which permitted her to work from home, primarily doing telephone\nsolicitation. Shortly after the birth of their second son, Applicant\u2019s wife became very\ndepressed, sleeping most of the day rather than working. Doctors diagnosed her with\npost partum depression and started treating her with prozac, an anti-depressant.\nBecause of her illness, she did not work regularly, causing a decline in family income.\nShe managed the family finances. When their income was not sufficient to meet\nordinary household expenses, she began using credit cards to pay for food, utilities and\nother everyday expenses. She hide the financial problems from Applicant.4\nIn November 2001, a serious car incident occurred in front of their home. A trash\ntruck ran over one of its employee\u2019s.  Applicant\u2019s wife ran out to help the injured man,\n\nAttachments to response to SOR; AE N, supra note 4; Tr. 35-38, 48-50.\n5\nAttachments to response to SOR; AE I (401K documents); Tr. 38-39, 66.\n6\nAttachments to response to SOR; AE Q (Credit report, dated April 30, 2008); Tr. 39, 42-43, 45-47, 66-67.\n7\nAttachments to response to SOR: AE Q, supra note 7; Tr.42-43, 67.\n8\n3\nand called for medical help for a broken leg. While waiting for medical help, she\ndiscovered that the injured man had been disemboweled. He died in the arms of\nApplicant\u2019s wife. Shortly after this incident, Applicant\u2019s wife felt tremendous guilt about\nher initial call for medical help. Her guilt caused serious depression, to the point she\nconsidered suicide. She eventually sought medical help. Doctors diagnosed her with\ncomplex post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from her witnessing her\nmother\u2019s suicide and borderline personality disorder. She began treatment, which\nincluded therapy and medication. Applicant knew about the post partum depression and\nher emotional difficulty with witnessing the death of the trash man. She kept her more\nrecent diagnoses from him. She continued to manage the family finances and their\nfinancial problems continued. She still did not tell her husband about the problems. In\nFebruary 2008, doctors diagnosed her with attention deficit disorder.  \n5\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems increased over a period of time because his wife\ncontinued to use credit cards to pay regular expenses. By 2004, the mortgage holder on\ntheir house started foreclosure proceedings because they had missed their monthly\npayments. Applicant obtained a loan on his 401K account and paid the overdue\npayments. He repays this loan through regular payroll deductions. He currently owes\nless than $1,000 on this debt.6\nThe family finances continued to decline. One creditor filed a civil action against\nApplicant and obtained a judgment against him. Applicant did not know about the court\naction as his wife signed for the papers, then hide the information from him. Because\nshe worked at home, she intercepted overdue notices and other negative information\nabout their financial problems. She disconnected the telephone in the evening, telling\nher husband she was preventing newspaper customers from interrupting their dinner\nand evening time. Applicant learned about the court judgment when the creditor\ngarnished his salary in 2006.7\nIn 2006, the mortgagor started a second foreclosure procedure on their home as\nthe mortgage payments were overdue again. Applicant and his wife negotiated a\nrepayment plan with the mortgagor in early 2006. The parties agreed to a $500 increase\nin the monthly payment for two years. Applicant and his wife agreed to a timely payment\nor the mortgagor would foreclose on their property. They complied with the terms of this\nagreement. They made their final payment in early 2008.8\nWith the foreclosure and garnishment, Applicant assumed primary responsibility\nfor the family finances in 2006. He and his wife considered bankruptcy, but he decided\nto repay the creditors, as he considered the debts his responsibility. Financial\n\nTr. 41, 53-55, 72.\n9\nSOR at 1-2; Attachments to response to SOR; AE A to AE F (Verification of debt payments); Tr. 66-75.\n10\nAE G - AE J (Documents showing debts current); AE K (Budget and pay statements); AE K (Tax returns from\n11\n2003-2007); Tr. 40, 56, 80-85, 89.\nAE M (Performance evaluations, awards and recommendations); AE P (Boy Scout verification); Tr. 52, 56,\n12\n58.\n4\ncounselors declined to provide any assistance telling them their debt was too high. More\nrecently, a financial counseling service agreed to help, but Applicant no longer needs\ntheir assistance.9\nThe SOR lists four other unpaid debts. Applicant negotiated a settlement for each\naccount listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.d and paid the negotiated settlements amount over\nthe last two years. Applicant used tax return money and sold excess leave back to his\nemployer twice to repay these debts.  For the debt in \u00b6 1.e, Applicant paid this debt\nthrough garnishment. It is paid in full. All the debts listed in the SOR have been paid.\nApplicant is current on all his monthly bills. He has a business credit card, but no\npersonal credit cards.10\nApplicant\u2019s wife now works full time. She recently received a significant salary\nincrease. She now earns approximately $32,500 a year. Applicant earns approximately\n$43,000 a year. Household net monthly income totals approximately $5,200 a month,\nincluding $600 in child support from the father of their oldest son. Household monthly\nexpenses total $4,000, leaving approximately $1,200 a month for unexpected expenses.\nTheir tax returns for the years 2003 through 2007 reflect a $20,000 increase in\nhousehold income.  \n11\n \nApplicant\u2019s employer rates his performance as excellent. Recommendations\nwritten by his project leader and a co-worker reflect that Applicant is reliable and\nhardworking. He has received regular salary increases and performance awards. He is\nrespected by his co-workers. Applicant is a den leader for a local boy scout troop. His\nwife\u2019s medical condition is under control.12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n5\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n6\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some significant delinquent debt over a\nperiod of time, which was referred to collection or resulted in the initiation of foreclosure\nproceedings twice and a judgment. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose when his wife became ill after the birth of their second son. She\nhid the problem and its extent from Applicant for years. While his debt problems began\nyears ago, the problems continued until the present. This potentially mitigating condition\ndoes not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from his wife=s medical problems, as well as loss of her\nincome during her long period of illness. When Applicant learned of the first foreclosure,\nhe borrowed money from his 401K account and repaid the overdue mortgage\npayments. In 2006, he took over the household finances when he learned about the\nextent of the new financial problems. He acted responsibly in identifying and resolving\nthese debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant attempted to hire financial counselors, but was\nrejected because his debt was too high. He also considered bankruptcy, but decided to\npay his debts. Over the last two years, Applicant has negotiated repayments amounts\nfor his debts and paid these amounts. He honored his commitment to repay his past\ndue mortgage payments. He has resolved all his delinquent debts, either by payment or\nsettlement. With his current income, he is now financially sound and prepared for future\ncontingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nstarted about eight years ago. Over a period of four years, his debts slowly escalated.\nHis wife\u2019s depression and PTSD contributed significantly to the problem because she\ndid not work much and hid the extent of the problem from Applicant. Applicant\u2019s failure\nto take an active role in household finances also contributed to the problems. Since\n2006, Applicant has completely changed his attitude about his role in the household\nfinances. He now takes primary responsibility for managing the household finances. He\ndecided against filing for bankruptcy and to repay his debt, which he has done. He did\nnot resort to any illegal means to obtain the money necessary to repay his debt. He\nnegotiated settlements, then used his tax returns and the money from the sale of his\nleave to pay the debts. He complied with the terms of his repayment plan with his\nmortgagor. He pays all his current bills in a timely fashion. His wife\u2019s medical condition\nis under control. She acknowledges her conduct in creating this problem and he\nconsiders the debts his responsibility. He is a dependable and reliable worker. His\nemployer routinely rates his performance as excellent. He provides a stable domestic\nenvironment for his family. Most significantly, he has taken affirmative action to pay or\nresolve the delinquent debts raising security concerns. His debts cannot be a source of\nimproper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are\npaidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a\nsecurity clearance. His household income has improved significantly in the last five\nyears and his current debts are easy to manage with his present net monthly income.\nHe has acted responsibly in resolving his debts, which are insufficient to raise security\nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n\n8\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

However, Applicant intentionally \nomitted complete information about his marijuana use on his 2003 and 2006 security \nclearance applications. Personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns are not \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 9, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-\n86), and on December 15, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF-86). (GE 1, 5) \nOn October 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; \nSeptember 24, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005. \n  \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement), E \n(personal conduct), and J (criminal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, \nor revoked. (HE 2) \n \nOn November 13, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On April 22, \n2010, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On \nMay 3, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On May 12, 2010, DOHA issued \na hearing notice. (HE 1) On June 2, 2010, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Tr. 23), and Applicant offered 11 \nexhibits. (Tr. 25-27; AE A-J) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE \nA-J. (Tr. 23, 27) Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR. (HE 1-3) On June 9, 2010, I received the transcript.    \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nDepartment Counsel made a motion to change the year in SOR \u00b6 2.e from \n\u201c2009\u201d to \u201c2008,\u201d because 2008 was the correct year Applicant responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories. (Tr. 16-17; HE 3) There was no objection and I granted Department \nCounsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 16-17) \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s hearing, the SOR was amended adding an allegation under SOR \u00b6 \n2.f that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose his marijuana use on his September 9, \n2003 SF-86. (Tr. 69-70) There was no objection to the SOR amendment. (Tr. 69-70) I \ngranted the motion to amend the SOR. \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted the following allegations: (1) he purchased \nmarijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and (2) he used marijuana after being granted a Secret security \nclearance (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (HE 3) In regard to SOR \u00b6 2.d, he admitted that he erroneously \nindicated that he did not use marijuana while holding a security clearance. (HE 3) He \ndenied the remaining SOR allegations.

(Tr. 42) He did not go to class or to work impaired by previous marijuana \nconsumption. (Tr. 39-40) When he was in college, he purchased marijuana about once \na month. (Tr. 43) He increased his marijuana use in college to one or two times a \nmonth. (Tr. 43)  \n \n \nIn 2003, before Applicant started employment with his current employer, he \nstopped using marijuana so that he could pass any drug screenings. (Tr. 52) He \nstopped using marijuana from about May 2003 to about June 2004. (Tr. 93-94) In \nSeptember 2003, Applicant began his employment with his current employer. (Tr. 47) \n \n \nOn March 19, 2005, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana. (Tr. 59-\n61; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 3.a; GE 3) He did not remember who gave him the marijuana. (Tr. 50) \nHe was found guilty and sentenced to 10 hours of community service, to pay a $331 \nfine, and to attend ten Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) \nmeetings. (Tr. 56; AE B, C, D) In October 2005, he completed his community service. \n(AE C) Applicant attended ten NA meetings. (Tr. 57; AE B) In November 2006, he \ndisclosed his arrest to his facility security officer. (Tr. 55, 62-63) He did not report the \narrest earlier because he thought it was just a ticket or citation. (Tr. 62) In December \n2006, he completed all court-ordered requirements. (Tr. 63; AE B-D) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent marijuana use was in March 2005. (Tr. 46) Applicant \ndoes not associate with the friends from college who used marijuana with him. (Tr. 46) \nHowever, he \u201cmay have smoked\u201d marijuana with his younger sister. (Tr. 54) His sister \nno longer smokes marijuana. (Tr. 54) Applicant\u2019s spouse does not smoke marijuana. \n(Tr. 48) After Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana, he informed his future \nspouse of the arrest. (Tr. 49) In 2005, she had a security clearance and she was \nshocked when he advised her of his arrest. (Tr. 49-50)  \n \n2003 security clearance application \n \nOn September 9, 2003, Applicant signed his SF-86. (Tr. 66-67; SOR \u00b6 2.f; GE 5) \nOn his September 9, 2003 SF-86 he responded, \u201cNo\u201d to Question 27, which asks: \n \nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\u2014Illegal Use of Drugs Since \nthe age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally \nused any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack \ncocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?  (Tr. 67-68)  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said that he did not disclose his extensive marijuana \nuse on his 2003 SF-86 because he was ashamed of his marijuana use and did not want \nhis employer to know about it. (Tr. 68)2  \n \n2006 security clearance application and August 2007 Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) interview \n \nOn December 15, 2006, Applicant signed his SF-86. (GE 1) Section 23d asks, \n\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or \ndrugs?\u201d Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d and explained that in March 2005 he was arrested \nfor possession of marijuana. (GE 1) He described the court\u2019s sentence, indicated he \ncompleted all court-ordered requirements, and the charge was dismissed on December \n12, 2006. (GE 1) SOR \u00b6 2.b indicated Applicant provided false information because the \noffense was actually in February 2006. Applicant\u2019s arrest was on March 19, 2005, and \nhe had a court date in February 2006. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s explanation for Section \n23d was actually accurate. (Tr. 71-72; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 3.b)     \n \nSection 24 of his 2006 security clearance, asks: \n \n24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity \n \nThe following questions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity. \nYou are required to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your \nfailure to do so could be grounds for an adverse employment decision or \naction against you, but neither your truthful responses nor information \nderived from your responses will be used as evidence against you in any \nsubsequent criminal proceeding. \n \na.

(Tr. 75; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 3.b; GE 1)   \n \n \n2 As indicated previously, SOR \u00b6 2.f was added to the SOR. (Tr. 69-70) SOR \u00b6 2.f alleged \nApplicant failed to disclose his marijuana use on his September 9, 2003 SF-86. (Tr. 69-70)  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to section 24a and \u201cNo\u201d to section 24b. (GE 1) In the \ncomments section, he said that he used marijuana from June 2004 to March 2005 in \nsocial settings on multiple occasions. (SOR \u00b6 1.c; GE 1) Applicant did not list his earlier \nmarijuana use because he was apprehensive and scared that he would lose his job. (Tr. \n73-74) He admitted that he should have indicated he used marijuana starting in the \nsummer of 1999, and that his answer was deliberately false. (Tr. 74-75) He was aware \nthat on his previous SF-86 he had not disclosed his marijuana use. (Tr. 86) He \nemphasized that he was worried that he would lose his job. (Tr. 87) He believed a \nlonger period of marijuana use would make him look worse, and he did not know he \nwould be interviewed by an investigator. (Tr. 91-92) When Applicant responded to SOR \n\u00b6 2.c, he denied that he deliberately misrepresented his marijuana usage dates. (HE 3) \nAt his hearing, he admitted that he deliberately misrepresented his marijuana usage \ndates, and his SOR response denying the allegation was based on the incorrect date for \nhis arrest in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 90-91; HE 3) \n   \nApplicant had a security clearance continuously from 2003 to December 12, \n2006, and his incorrect answer to section 24b was because he failed to carefully read \nthe question. (Tr. 75, 89-90) He thought it was limited to police officers, prosecutors, \nand courtroom officials, and did not notice the part about security clearance holders. (Tr. \n75-76; SOR \u00b6 2.d) As indicated previously, he did admit on the same SF-86 that he has \nused marijuana as recently as March 2005.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e indicated Applicant provided false information to an OPM investigator \non August 16, 2007, when he indicated his most recent marijuana use was in March \n2005. At the time the SOR was written, the Government erroneously believed \nApplicant\u2019s arrest for marijuana possession was in February 2006, rather than on March \n19, 2005. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s statement to the OPM investigator about his most \nrecent marijuana use was accurate. (Tr. 76-77)     \n \n \nA substance abuse practitioner and assessor evaluated Applicant and \ndetermined that he was at low probability for future drug abuse. (Tr. 79-80; AE I) The \nassessor recommended Applicant attend 10 AA/NA meetings.

(AE E)   \n      \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on \nany express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \nIt is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President \nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines H (drug involvement), E (personal conduct), and J \n(criminal conduct) with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d3 \n\u201cillegal drug possession or sale or distribution,\u201d and \u201cany illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance.\u201d These three disqualifying conditions apply because \nApplicant used and possessed marijuana.4 He fully disclosed his drug abuse at his \nhearing. He possessed marijuana before he used it. Applicant\u2019s Secret security \n \n3AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n4AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substance. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. \nRaish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nclearance was approved in 2003, and he used marijuana on multiple occasions from \nJuly 2004 to March 2005.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) can mitigate security concerns when drug offenses are not recent. \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when such conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d5 \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant\u2019s extensive marijuana use lasted several years. He stopped using \nmarijuana from about May 2003 to June 2004. Then he resumed his marijuana use until \nhis arrest on March 19, 2005 for marijuana possession. Applicant\u2019s most recent \nmarijuana use was in March 2005, more than five years prior to his hearing. He \nrecognizes the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse. He received some therapy, and \nattended 10 NA meetings. He is now married and has three children. These actions \ncreate some certitude that he will continue to abstain from drug use. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies \nto his marijuana-related offenses.6    \n \nApplicant demonstrated his intent not to abuse illegal drugs in the future. He has \ndisassociated from his drug-using associates and contacts. He has broken his patterns \nof drug abuse, and he has changed his life with respect to illegal drug use. He has \nabstained from drug abuse for more than five years. He provided \u201ca signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs. Marijuana was never prescribed for him. He receives partial credit \nbecause he attended 10 weeks of NA meetings, and he received a prognosis of low \nprobability of recurrence of drug abuse. He does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 26(d) \nbecause he did not provide sufficient evidence of the qualifications of the person who \nprovided the prognosis. More detail about the drug-treatment program he completed is \nnecessary to assess its validity.  \n  \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in March 2005, more than five \nyears ago. The motivations to stop using illegal drugs are evident. He understands the \n \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n6In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nadverse results from marijuana use.7 He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track \nrecord of no drug abuse to eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to \nclassified information.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process \nthe adjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and  \n \n(d)(3) a pattern of dishonesty violations.8 \n \n7Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n \n8The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd.

He did not disclose his \nmarijuana use for several years and continuing to May 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.f). When he \ncompleted his December 15, 2006 SF-86, he intentionally understated the duration of \nhis marijuana use when he stated in the comments section that he used marijuana from \nJune 2004 to March 2005 in social settings on multiple occasions. He did not disclose \nhis marijuana use from 1999 to May 2003. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b) and 16(d)(3) \nall apply. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges Applicant failed to disclose his marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance on his December 15, 2006 SF-86. Applicant\u2019s statement that he \ninadvertently failed to disclose this information is credible. He disclosed his marijuana \nuse and his marijuana arrest on March 19, 2005, and the Government was well aware \nthat Applicant held a security clearance in March 2005. Applicant has successfully \nrefuted SOR \u00b6 2.d.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nApplicant deserves substantial credit in the whole-person analysis for candidly \nadmitting he falsified the 2003 and 2006 SF-86s in order to continue his employment. I \nfound Applicant\u2019s statements at the hearing and in his SOR response about his \nmarijuana use and his reason for falsifying his security documents to be credible. \nHowever, the personal conduct concerns pertaining to Applicant\u2019s falsification of his \n2006 SF-86 about the duration of his marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 2.d), and his falsification of \nhis 2003 SF-86 when he denied any marijuana use in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.f) \ncannot be mitigated at this time because they are too serious and too recent.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant possessed marijuana on March 19, 2005. (SOR \u00b6 3.a) He also \nintentionally failed to disclose the duration of his marijuana use on his 2006 SF-86 as \ndiscussed in the Personal Conduct section. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) For a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1001 to occur, the false statement to the Government must be material. The Supreme \nCourt defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995), as a \nstatement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the \ndecision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, \n386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    \n \n  \nAs indicated previously, I found that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose \ninformation about the duration of his marijuana use on his 2006 SF-86. If Applicant had \nprovided an accurate answer on his 2006 SF-86 about the extent of his marijuana use, \nhis accurate answer would be capable of influencing the government to deny his \nsecurity clearance because he would have disclosed that he provided false information \non his 2003 SF-86. It was sufficiently serious9 to jeopardize approval of his security \nclearance. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony \n \n9 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(the maximum potential sentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 \nfine).  In sum, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply because the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and \n3.b are established.    \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to all of the offenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) \nand 32(c) do not apply because Applicant admitted the offenses and no one pressured \nhim into committing the offenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are similar and applicable to \nhis possession of marijuana offense. Applicant's marijuana possession in March 2005 is \na misdemeanor, and Applicant completed all court-ordered requirements. On December \n12, 2006, the marijuana possession charge was dismissed. The marijuana possession \noffense is mitigated by the passage of time (SOR \u00b6 3.a).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his December 15, 2006 SF-86 is more \nproblematic. He deliberately and intentionally falsified his 2006 SF-86 by not disclosing \nthe duration of his marijuana use because he wanted to deceive the Government into \nallowing him to retain his employment. \n \nMore progress is necessary to assure Applicant has the reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment necessary to safeguard classified information. His \nfailure to be fully candid and forthright shows poor judgment and militates against \napproval of a security clearance.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nwas relatively young and immature when he began using marijuana. He served his \ncountry as an employee of a Government contractor. He stopped using marijuana from \nMay 2003 to June 2004, and again after March 19, 2005. He showed he has the ability \nto abstain from marijuana use for lengthy periods of time. In his SOR response and at \nhis hearing, he frankly and candidly admitted his extensive history of marijuana use. He \nreceived some drug counseling and therapy. He knows the consequences of marijuana \nuse. Applicant contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no \nevidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His \ncharacter and good work performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation and \nmitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to \nretain his employment after his security clearance was called into question. A former \nsupervisor, his spouse, and his facility security officer laud his hard work, loyalty, \ntrustworthiness, and dedication. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain from \nmarijuana use, and avoids future offenses he will eventually have future potential for \naccess to classified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant failed to disclose his marijuana use on his 2003 SF-86, and he failed to fully \ndisclose his marijuana use on 2006 SF-86. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. These offenses show a lack of judgment and a failure to \nabide by the law. Such judgment lapses are especially relevant because they were \nmade in the context of security requirements. His falsifications of two SF-86s raise a \nserious security concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude drug involvement concerns \nare fully mitigated; however, personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns, relating \nto falsifications of two SF-86s, are not mitigated at this time. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d and 2.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on February 22, 2007. On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December \n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 13, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on May 22, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 28, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 6, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 24, \n2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, identified by \nList of Government Exhibits (Ex. I), which were received without objection. Applicant \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were received without objection, \nand testified on his own behalf.   \n \nI held the record open until August 8, 2008 to afford Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE G and H, without \nobjection, which were forwarded to me by Department Counsel by Memorandum, \ndated August 7, 2008 (Ex. II). By e-mail dated August 8, 2008, Applicant requested an \nextension of the August 8, 2008 deadline. Without objection from Department \nCounsel, I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until August 19, 2008 \n(Ex. III). Applicant submitted AE I and AE J without objection on August 14, 2008. \nApplicant submitted AE K without objection, which was forwarded to me by \nDepartment Counsel by Memorandum, dated August 19, 2008 (Ex. IV). DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 4, 2008. The record closed on August \n19, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old old computer operator, who has been employed by \nhis defense contractor employer since July 2003. GE 1, Tr. 20-21. He seeks to renew \nhis security clearance, which was previously granted while serving in the U.S. Air \nForce and was transferred to his current employment. Applicant believes retaining a \nclearance is a condition of his continued employment. Tr. 21-22, 35. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1980. Tr. 19. He served in the Air \nForce from June 1982 to August 2002, and retired as a Staff Sergeant (pay grade E-\n5). His Air Force Specialty Code was 250X2 \u2013 Supply Systems Analyst. GE 1, Tr. 16-\n19. Applicant successfully held a secret clearance while in the Air Force for his last 18 \nyears of active duty. Tr. 21-23. Applicant has never been married, and has no \ndependents. GE 1, Tr. 16. Applicant estimates that he has completed 12 college credit \nhours. Tr. 20. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \npersonal conduct which included the review of his February 2007 e-QIP, his April 2008 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand March 2007 credit bureau reports, and his February 2008 Responses to \nInterrogatories. GE 1 \u2013 4. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified four separate line items consisting of two collection \naccounts and two charged off accounts totaling $27,423. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. - 1.d.) All of \nthese debts are credit card accounts. Tr. 31. Applicant retained the services of a credit \ncounseling service, received financial counseling, and established a debt \nconsolidation program. His credit counseling service contacted all of his creditors, \nestablished a single monthly minimum payment for Applicant, which he pays to his \ncredit counseling service by direct debit. AE G. Before he retained the services of a \ncredit counseling service, Applicant was attempting to pay off his creditors in a piece \nmeal fashion, which he found inefficient and costly. Tr. 36-40, 44-54. In short, he has \nresolved all debts alleged in the SOR. \n \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to loss of income when he retired \nfrom the Air Force, a move, and underemployment. He explained while the Air Force a \nsignificant portion of his pay was tax free. Upon retiring from the Air Force he also \nincurred medical expenses he did not previously have as a result of paying for health \ninsurance and co-pays. After he retired, he moved to an area not served by a military \ntreatment facility and had to seek medical care outside of the military health care \nsystem. He also acknowledged he fell prey to easy credit and was not a good money \nmanager. Answer to SOR, Tr. 59-62. \n \nApplicant has established a budget with the assistance of his credit counseling \nservice, which reflects a net monthly remainder of $253 after he has paid all of his \nmonthly bills. His credit counseling service developed a comprehensive plan to \nachieve financial stability to include an estimated payoff and savings plan, creditor \nsummary, spending assessment, and personal action plan. AE H.  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his February 2007 e-QIP SF-86, he failed to provide \ncorrect answers relating to financial delinquencies over 180 days in the last seven \nyears, and financial delinquencies currently over 90 days delinquent. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \nand 2.b.)  \n \nWhen queried about his incorrect answers, he responded \u201cas stated in the \n[Answer to SOR], that was my own stupid mistake. Stupidity on my part.\u201d Tr. 56. \nApplicant stated that he did not pull his credit report before completing his e-QIP. Tr. \n56-57. Four months later in July 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) Investigator and freely acknowledged to that \nInvestigator after reviewing his credit report that his answers on his e-QIP were \nincorrect. Answer to SOR, Tr. 76-77. \n \nApplicant provided a reference letter from one of his company managers, who \nsaid, \u201c[Applicant] also demonstrated honesty, reliability and proved to be very \ndependable while performing his daily duties.\u201d Referring to the position Applicant fills, \n\u201cThe position is one of our highest positions of trust within the government operations \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfor this particular contract for [Government agency].\u201d Adding, \u201cI can confirm that \n[Applicant] is a man of great integrity, trustworthiness, and is extremely dedicated to \nhis family and work.\u201d AE D. Applicant submitted his last three years of work \nperformance evaluations reflecting consistent above average performance. AE E. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial considerations concerns were established by his \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s evidence. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties stem from \nunderemployment, difficulty in making the financial adjustment of active duty pay to \nprivate sector pay, uncovered health care costs, and mismanagement. \n  \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 \n19, two are applicable:  \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant demonstrated that whatever financial difficulties he encountered \ntransitioning from active duty Air Force life to private sector life are behind him. His \nunderemployment no doubt created part of his financial difficulties. His current job and \nAir Force retirement provide him sufficient income to meet his financial obligations. \nAlso, he had the good sense to seek the services of a competent and reputable \nfinancial counseling service, which guided him through the process of achieving \nfinancial stability. His debts although not paid in full are being paid in a timely and \npredictable manner. After all of his monthly payments are made, he has a net monthly \nremainder of $253. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,1 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are applicable or \npartially applicable:  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to Personal Conduct is set out in AG & 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during \nthe security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process. \n \nOf the seven Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 16, two \nare applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in \nanother country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nthat is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve \nas a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or \nintelligence service or other group.  \n \nPosing potential security concerns are Applicant\u2019s documented omissions of his \nfinancial delinquencies from his February 2007 e-QIP. His omissions are attributable \nto his misunderstanding of the question asked and carelessness. Having observed \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and the forthright assessment of his failure to exercise greater \ncare in responding to these questions and character evidence suggests his behavior \nwas not intentional. I also note when he was questioned by the OPM Investigator four \nmonths after he completed his e-QUIP, he freely acknowledged his failure to provide \naccurate information about his financial indebtedness. \n \nI found Applicant to be credible and acted in good faith. While he could \nreasonably have been expected to be more diligent when answering questions \nregarding financial delinquencies, his judgment lapses and inattention to detail are not \nenough to impute knowing and willful falsification under Guideline E. There being no \nmisconduct substantiated, there is no need to discuss Personal Conduct Mitigating \nConditions.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d2 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOctober 31, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 13, 2008, detailing security concerns \nunder financial considerations.  \n \n \nOn July 2, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On July \n22, 2008, I was assigned the case. On July 25, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing held on August 21, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) \n1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence.

There being no objection, the material \nwas admitted into evidence as Ex. A. On September 2, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations of the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old analyst who has worked for a defense contractor since \n2001, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 38, 79) Her husband describes \nApplicant as a woman of integrity, strong character, and great moral values who is the \n\u201cmost trustworthy, reliable and dependable human being\u201d he knows. (Ex. A)  \n \nIn 1985, Applicant came to the United States from Zimbabwe. (Tr. 35) In July \n2005, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Tr. 38) Her son, born in 1987, is a U.S. \nNavy medic. (Tr. 36) Applicant divorced in 1995 and remarried in 1996. (Tr. 37) In 1998, \nher second child, a daughter was born. In 2004, her youngest child, also a daughter \nwas born prematurely, had developmental delays, and has special needs. (Tr, 57, Ex. \nA, Ex. 2) Applicant works 30 hours per week due to her daughter\u2019s special needs. At \npresent she commutes between three and four hours a day, four days a week. If \nApplicant receives a clearance, her employer would transfer her to a work location \ncloser to her home. (Tr. 28) \n \n \nIn June 1995, Applicant obtained a master\u2019s in business administration (MBA) in \nfinance.(Tr. 37) She owes approximately $18,000 in student loans, which are currently \nin a forbearance or deferment status. (Tr. 67) Applicant also owes $18,000 on a credit \ncard. (Tr. 66) Neither of these debts are delinquent.  \n \nIn the mid 2000s, Applicant was looking for a way to make money while \nremaining at home with her daughter. She observed others purchasing investment \nproperties and selling them at a profit. She and her husband intended to purchase real \nestate, keep it for five or six months, and they sell it at a profit. (Tr. 44) They decided to \npurchase a town home; her husband states it looked to be a good decision. (Tr. 88) Her \nhusband urged against a real estate investment because he did not want the hassle of \nrental property. (Tr. 88) He believes the logic of his wife\u2019s decision was impeccable at \nthe time particularly when viewing the way home prices were increasing at the time. (Tr. \n88 - 89) Unfortunately, the market conditions turned in an unexpected way. (Tr. 89)  \n \n\n \n \n \n3\nThey chose to purchase a town home in an area five minutes from their home \nand in a neighborhood where they had previously lived for seven years. (Tr. 91) Even \nthough Applicant felt uneasy about the transaction, she went through with the purchase. \nApplicant credit was excellent at the time of the purchase. (Tr. 21, 25) \n \n \nIn July 2005, Applicant purchased a town home. Applicant put down $1,000 \nearnest money. The remaining balance of $377,741 ($370,000 contract price plus \n$7,741 settlement charges) was split into a $296,000 first mortgage and an equity line \nof credit of $74,000. Following the purchase, the housing market took a downward turn. \nWithin three months of the purchase, the town home had declined $75,000 in value.  \n \nApplicant was to make monthly interest only payments of approximately $3,000 \non the two loans. (Tr. 42) Applicant paid $2,125 monthly on the first mortgage and $625 \non the line of credit plus escrow fees. (Tr. 43) The line of credit was at a variable \ninterest rate, which increased raising their monthly payment to $850 on the equity line of \ncredit. (Tr. 53, 54) \n \n \nApplicant asserts she never used the line of credit on the town home. Purchasers \nare normally required to pay a minimum of 20% of the contract sales price at the time of \nclosing. On a $370,000 mortgage 20% would be $74,000. The line of credit was \n$74,000.  \n \n \nIt was never Applicant\u2019s intention to occupy the town home. It was intended the \nproperty would be rented thereby generating income and covering part of the monthly \nmortgage. Just prior to purchasing the home, Applicant learned the expected monthly \nrent would not exceed $1,500, which would cover only half of the $3,000 monthly \nmortgage payment. (Tr. 45) Tax advantages of owing rental property routinely provide \nsome relief to address a portion of the shortfall. However, Applicant was told the only \ntax advantage she could claim was a $2,000 per year deduction for depreciation, which \nresulted in a yearly tax savings of $1,200. (Tr. 62-63, Ex. A) \n \nApplicant had problems renting the property. The two months following purchase, \nthe sellers stayed in the home paying rent. Applicant was unable to find a tenant for the \nnext two months. (Tr. 47) The first tenant she located failed to timely pay the rent, then \nfailed to pay rent for two months, broke windows, and did other damage to the property. \nThe tenant occupied the town home for five months. (Tr. 71) From January through \nMarch 2006, Applicant actively sought to evict the tenant. In March 2006, the tenant \nwas evicted. Applicant was unable to find new tenants and had to make mortgage \npayments on both the investment property and her home after March 2006.  \n \nApplicant contacted the mortgage company to determine her options. Applicant \nqualified with the mortgage company for a \u201cshort sale.\u201d (Tr. 49) A short sale allows a \nhome to be sold at its current market value to avoid a potential foreclosure and negative \ncredit rating. (Ex. 2) Applicant worked with her mortgage company for five or six months \nattempting to negotiate a short sale. Applicant hired a realtor to attempt to find a new \nbuyer. (Tr. 51)  \n \n\n \n \n \n4\n \nIn 2003, Applicant and her husband purchased the home they live in for \napproximately $300,000. (Tr. 29) They have never been late on a mortgage payment \nand the taxes on the home are paid timely. (Tr. 41) Last year their home was assessed \nat $550,000, but had devalued to approximately $450,000. During 2006, they refinanced \ntheir home several times to continue paying the mortgage on the town house. Applicant \nincreased her hours at work to generate more income. Applicant exhausted her funds in \nher 401(k) retirement fund making the town home\u2019s monthly mortgage payment. \nApplicant contemplated selling her home and moving into the town home, but this was \nprevented by the current status of the housing market. Their neighbor\u2019s home failed to \nsell having been on the market for a year and a half. Applicant attempted to sell the \ntown home. Since the fair market value of the house had dropped, the town home could \nnot be sold for the value owed on the first mortgage and equity line of credit. Applicant \ncontinued to make payments until October 2006, when all funds were exhausted.  \n \nIn December 2006, Applicant\u2019s realtor found a buyer who offered to purchase the \ntown home for $326,000, which was a \u201cmuch higher\u201d offer than they going rate. (Ex. 2) \nThe buyer moved into the town home, with a clause in the purchase contract directing \nthe return all rents paid if the offer to purchase failed to close. In February 2007, the \nmortgage company informed Applicant the property would go to foreclosure. The \npotential buyer left the property and in March 2007 the town home was sold at \nforeclosure for $305,000.  \n \nSince the foreclosure, the mortgage company has actively sought repayment of \nthe home equity line of credit. Applicant states, \u201c[f]or endless weeks and months, they \nharassed me. They hired another company to do it and they were brutal.\u201d Applicant \noffered $5,000 to settle the matter, which was not accepted. The creditor stated at least \n$18,000 was needed. (Tr. 73) \u201cThe debt collector called evenings, early mornings, and \nafternoons, at work, weekends and my cell phone.\u201d However, Applicant has not recently \nreceived a demand for payment from the creditor regarding the home equity line of \ncredit. (Tr. 74) As of April 2008, it was Applicant\u2019s plan to pay the home equity line of \ncredit. (Ex. 2) Applicant has made inquiries with an attorney as to bankruptcy, but was \nreluctant to go that route. (Tr. 95)  \n \nUntil November or December 2006, Applicant was able to pay the property \nowners\u2019 association (POS) monthly fees. In November 2007, the property owners \nassociation obtained a $319 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a) against Applicant for unpaid monthly \nfees. Applicant states her tenant was supposed to have paid the monthly payments. In \nApril 2008, the judgment was paid in full or otherwise satisfied. (See Answer to SOR)  \n \n \nIn July 2007, a health care provided obtained a $15,000 judgment against \nApplicant. (See Answer to SOR) The judgment was released in April 2008.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n \n \n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant purchased investment property that went to foreclosure in February \n2007. The foreclosure eliminated the first mortgage of approximately $300,000, but \nfailed to eliminate the $74,000 equity line of credit. Applicant offered to settle the debt \nfor $5,000, but the creditor indicated that a minimum payment of $18,000 was required. \nNo payment has been made on this debt. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; [and] \n\n \n \n \n7\n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant=s financial problems were contributed to by market factors beyond her \ncontrol. Shortly after purchasing the investment real estate for $370,000, the fair market \nvalue of the property dropped to $300,000. The decline in the value of the real estate is \nnot, of itself, the cause of the debt. Although the decline did prevent Applicant from \nliquidating the debt through sale of the property at the amount owed on the town house.  \n \nIt was the inability to secure a proper renter that was an additional factor beyond \nher control that resulted in the foreclosure. Applicant\u2019s first renter failed to pay the rent \nand after five months an eviction action was required. Another temporary tenant who \nwas living in the property following a purchase offer had all rents returned to her when \nthe property failed to close. With a renter paying a portion of the monthly mortgage, \nApplicant may have been able to prevent the foreclosure. \n \nApplicant asserts she never used the line of credit. However, the line of credit \nwas used to pay the customary 20% down payment required of purchasers. The \nvariable interest rate on the equity line of credit increased Applicant\u2019s inability to make \nher monthly payments.  \n \nApplicant did what she could to prevent the foreclosure. She increased her hours \nof work, thereby bring home more income. She actively sought to secure new tenants, \nbut was unsuccessful. She used her 401(k) retirement funds until they were exhausted. \nShe refinanced her principle residence, until all the available equity in that residence \nwas eliminated. She actively pursued alternatives with the mortgage holder including \nthe possibility of a short sale. She did what she could to prevent the foreclosure. \n \nFollowing foreclosure, Applicant offered to settle equity line of credit for $5,000, \nwhich was a good-faith offer to settle the debt. The creditor refused and demanded a \nminimum payment of $18,000, an amount she was unable to pay. \n \nAs her husband stated, her reasoning in purchasing the investment was sound at \nthe time. Homes were increasing in value. They knew the area and were only five \nminutes from the property so they could monitor the property. They anticipated house \nprices would continue to increase. The downturn in the housing market caught a large \nsegment of the population by surprise. Applicant and her husband were very insistent \nthat they would not buy investment property again.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies. The behavior is infrequent. The sole unpaid debt is the line of \ncredit. There are no other delinquent obligations. The debt was incurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. The downturn in the housing market does not \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nUnder AG & 20(b), the down turn of the market and the inability to find a paying \nwere beyond her control. Applicant did all she could to prevent the foreclosure. She \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Her current finances prevent making an \noffer of more than $5,000 to settle the line of credit.  \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply. There has been no showing Applicant has received \nfinancial counseling. However, except for this single debt, Applicant\u2019s finances are \nunder control. AG & 20(d) does not apply to the line of credit, but does apply to the \nproperty owner\u2019s association judgment because that judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $319) was \npaid and the judgment released. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The two debts are not the types that \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts set forth in the SOR were not \nincurred on luxuries, but were the monthly association fees on the investment property \nand the equity line of credit used as down payment to purchase the property. Applicant \nworked extra hours, used the equity in her home, and used her retirement funds to \n\n \n \n \n9\nprevent foreclosure, which shows a strong desire by Applicant\u2019s to prevent the \nforeclosure.  \n \nHaving had a bad experience with investment property it is unlikely Applicant will \nrepeat the conduct. A house went to foreclosure, but this does not indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. It does not \nraise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, or ability to protect classified \ninformation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a and 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has resolved most of those\ndebts and has taken meaningful steps to resolve others. He is well on his way to resuming\na financially stable lifestyle.\nOn November 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). On\nDecember 23, 2008, Applicant submitted a response to the SOR in which he admitted the\nallegations contained in subparagraphs 1.a-c, 1.e, 1.h-j, and 1.n, denied the allegations\ncontained in subparagraphs 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.k-m, and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 17, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on February 25, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued\non April 2, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 28, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted 12 documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n(AE) 1-12 and admitted into the record without objection. \nThe record was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional\ndocumentation in support of his case. Four documents or groups of documents were timely\nreceived, marked as AE 13-16 and admitted into the record without objection. Department\nCounsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and is\nincluded in the record. On June 10, 2009, I initiated a series of e-mail exchanges with\nDepartment Counsel in which she agreed to contact Applicant and provide him additional\ntime to submit post-hearing documentation if he wanted. Those e-mails have collectively\nbeen marked as App. Ex. II and are included in the record.  No additional documentation\nwas received by June 15, 2009, and the record was again closed. The transcript was\nreceived on May 7, 2009.     \nProcedural Matters\nDuring the hearing, the evidence established that the allegation contained in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.j was a duplicate of the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.f.\nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw the allegation in subparagraph 1.j, and that motion\nwas granted without objection. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 28-year-old man who has been employed as a security officer by a\ndefense contractor since June 2006. He graduated from high school in 1999. He attended\na professional school from September 2001 to February 2002, to obtain the required state\ncertification to perform official police duties. As part of his employment with the defense\ncontractor, he is also required to be a sworn special deputy with the local sheriff\u2019s\ndepartment, which he has been since June 2006. Before obtaining his current employment,\nApplicant worked as a police officer or security officer for several different employers. He\nhas also worked as a part-time security officer for a hospital since December 2001, on a\nvery limited basis when he is needed to fill in for someone else.\nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation from his supervisors and a co-\nworker. Those persons attest to Applicant being a hard-working, organized, efficient,\ncompetent and trustworthy employee. They each recommend that he be granted a security\nclearance. \n   \nApplicant has been married since November 2002.  He and his wife have an eight-\nyear-old daughter. Applicant\u2019s wife is employed and her net pay is approximately $1,700\n\n Although the receipt marked as AE 7 indicates this debt was paid by credit card, Applicant credibly\n2\ntestified the card used was actually a checking account debit card (Tr. 82)\n3\nper month. She had been working as a manager of a retail store when their daughter was\nborn, earning about $18 per hour. She relinquished her management position due to the\nbirth of the child but was retained in a lesser position but at the same hourly rate.\nEventually, the employer found a reason to terminate her employment. She was then\nunemployed for about six months until she found a job that paid her $13-14 per hour.\nApplicant attributes the financial problems he has experienced for the past several years\nto his wife\u2019s unemployment and re-employment at a significantly reduced wage. \nApplicant obtained a promotion and salary increase in January 2009. His current net\nmonthly pay is about $2,800. He estimates his recurring monthly expenses for food,\nclothing, utilities, car expenses, medical expenses, tuition for his daughter at a private\nschool, and entertainment to be approximately $2,150. The mortgage payment on his\nhouse is $878, but because of ongoing negotiations with the mortgage company he has\nbeen instructed to not make the payment for the last few months. Applicant had about\n$3,000 in his checking account as of the date of the hearing. He does not have any open\ncredit cards. He has applied a substantial portion of the discretionary income he currently\nhas available to satisfy his delinquent creditors. \nThe debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a-1.c, owing in the total amount of $242,\narose from medical expenses. Applicant paid those debts, and apparently three others that\nwere not listed in the SOR, in full on May 15, 2009. (AE 15) The collection debt listed in\nsubparagraph 1.d, owing in the amount of $295, was originally owed to a telephone\ncompany. This account was settled-in-full as of April 27, 2009. (AE 5 & AE 12) The\ncollection debt listed in subparagraph 1.h, owing in the amount of $207, was originally a\nutility bill. This account was paid-in-full on April 27, 2009.      \n2\nThe debt listed in subparagraph 1.I, owing in the amount of $766, arose from a\ncredit card account. This account was settled-in-full for less than the full amount owing on\nMay 13, 2009. (AE 11 & AE 14) The charged off account listed in subparagraph 1.k, owing\nin the amount of $90, was actually paid-in-full as February 2004. (AE 8) The charged off\ncredit card account listed in subparagraph 1.m, owing in the amount of $1,038, was\nsatisfied and closed as of April 2008.\nApplicant testified he had made arrangements to pay the charged off department\nstore credit card account listed in subparagraph 1.d, owing in the amount of $295, on April\n30, 2009. He did not submit proof that he actually paid this account. \nApplicant testified he thought the account listed in subparagraph 1.f, owing in the\namount of $882, was a duplicate of the account listed in subparagraph 1.I. He based this\nassumption on the letters from the collection agency that are included as part of GE 4\nbecause he testified he only had one credit card with the bank listed in the letters that\nmake up GE 4. At the hearing, Department Counsel provided a detailed explanation and\ncomparison of the information contained in Applicant\u2019s Credit Bureau Reports (CBR) and\nother documents in the record that indicate the accounts are not duplicates. (Tr. 41-53) \n\n4\nApplicant also testified he thought the account listed in subparagraph 1.n, owing in\nthe amount of $212, was a duplicate of the account listed in 1.e., and that it had been paid\noff. Once again, Department Counsel provided a detailed explanation and comparison of\nthe information contained in Applicant\u2019s CBRs and other documents in the record that\nprobably indicates the accounts are not duplicates. (Tr. 64-72) However, it cannot be\nconcluded with certainty from the record evidence that they are not duplicates. Still,\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s interpretation of the information contained in the CBRs provides\nsufficient corroboration of Applicant\u2019s testimony that he paid the debt listed in\nsubparagraph 1.n to find that account has been satisfied. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l, owing in the amount of $2,433, is from a\njewelry store. The entries in Applicant\u2019s CBRs indicate the account was opened in either\nOctober 1999 or October 2000. Applicant testified he thought the debt had been\ndischarged in a bankruptcy action his wife had filed some years ago but he would satisfy\nthe debt if it is still valid. (Tr. 62-63) On May 15, 2009, the creditor presented Applicant with\nan offer to settle the account for $1,416, provided payment is made in full by July 30, 2009.\n(AE 16)   \nThe final account alleged in the SOR is subparagraph1.g and pertains to the\nmortgage on Applicant\u2019s residence. Applicant testified the lender talked him into acquiring\nan adjustable rate mortgage in October 2003. His monthly payment originally was $654.\nSince then the payment has at times increased to over $1,000 per month and appears\nfrom the entries in Applicant\u2019s CBRs to currently be set at $978 per month. Applicant\u2019s\nOctober 2008 CBR disclosed the account was past due in the amount of $9,778. His April\n2009 CBR disclosed the past due amount had increased to $16,623. \nApplicant testified he has been negotiating with the mortgage company seeking a\nloan modification that apparently is intended to convert the mortgage into a fixed rate\nmortgage. As part of the process, he was instructed by the company to not make any\nadditional payments on the loan. (Tr. 53-57) As of May 15, 2009, Applicant\u2019s request for\nassistance with his mortgage was pending review and the letter from the company\nindicated Applicant would be notified of the status of the review by June 14, 2009. (AE 13)\nThe record was reopened to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional\ninformation about the mortgage if it became available. No additional documentation was\nreceived by June 15, 2009, and the record was once again closed.    \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nThe SOR alleges 13 accounts that were either charged off, submitted for collection,\nor listed as seriously past due. Applicant admitted his liability for eight of the alleged\naccounts. The evidence establishes that all of the alleged delinquent accounts either are\n\n6\nor were at one time seriously delinquent. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from his wife\u2019s loss of employment and her\nsubsequent substantial reduction in pay. He submitted proof at the hearing and afterward\nthat he has satisfied nine of the alleged delinquent accounts that had been owing in the\ncombined amount of $2,792. He credibly testified he had made arrangements to pay\nanother account owing in the amount of $295 a few days after the hearing.\nApplicant was clearly and understandably confused about the collection account\nowing in the amount of $822 that remains unpaid. Likewise, he apparently was incorrect\nin his assumption that the charged off debt owing in the amount of $2,433 had been\ndischarged in a bankruptcy his wife filed some years ago. However, to his credit, AE 16\nindicates he contacted the creditor who had charged off the account and initiated\nnegotiations to settle the account in accordance with his testimony at the hearing. \nThe remaining delinquent account concerns Applicant\u2019s home mortgage. Like\ncountless thousands of his fellow citizens, Applicant got caught up in what can properly be\ndescribed as a banking fiasco. His CBRs disclose that the past due amount owing on his\nmortgage has increased tremendously in just the past six months. He testified he is doing\nwhatever he can to negotiate with the mortgage company to resolve the situation and has\nbeen instructed to not make any payments until some resolution is reached. He submitted\na letter that indicates the matter was under consideration. In a post-hearing conversation\nwith Department Counsel, Applicant indicated that as of June 15, 2009, some loan\nmodification was imminent. (App. Ex. II) Whether he will be successful in renegotiating his\nmortgage and saving his home cannot be known. However, the record does make clear\nhe is acting responsibly in attempting to resolve his personal mortgage crisis.      \nApplicant has not yet satisfied all his delinquent debts and his continuing mortgage\nissues may cause him to suffer a foreclosure in the not too distant future. Still, the efforts\nhe has made thus far to satisfy delinquent creditors, the proof he submitted of his\ncontinuing efforts to resolve others, his recent promotion and pay raise, the trust and\nconfidence he has earned from his supervisors and co-workers, and the total financial\nposture he is in as indicated by a comparison of his family income to family expenses\nstrongly indicate he will, in the very near future, be completely financially secure.\n \nAs a result of the above, I conclude Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior\n. . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 20(c): . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts apply. \n\n7\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and has\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraphs 1.k-n:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes delinquent debt totaling $18,853 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.s). Applicant denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o, but admitted the other debts. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old business operations clerk who has worked on a U.S. military installation since March 2007. She stayed on in her position after the company that had hired her lost the contract (Tr. 81, 114). Applicant has an interim security clearance for her duties (Tr. 81). In the fall of 1998, Applicant began undergraduate studies at a public university. She financed her education through student loans totaling about $50,496 (Ex. 4), some financial support from her parents, and seasonal income as a sales associate for a department store over the holidays in 1999 (Ex. 1). She obtained several credit card accounts in her name over the 1998/99 time frame (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1 2 1.q, and 1.r) (Ex. 4). Applicant paid her credit card bills on time until 2001. In November 2000, she lost her student research position after the professor for whom she had been working left the university (Ex. 1, Tr. 83). 3 In June 2001, Applicant transferred to another campus of the same university (Ex. 1). Her father lost his job that fall, and her parents had to reduce their financial support by 75% (Tr. 84). In addition to working as a ",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 17, 2007. On July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny her a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 24, 2008. She answered the\nSOR allegations in writing on August 20, 2008, and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on September 3, 2008, to conduct a hearing and to determine whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant. On October 6, 2008, Applicant requested a delay in holding her hearing\nFebruary 20, 2009\n\nApplicant testified with no evidence to the contrary that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was incurred by her\n1\nparents who used the credit card for college-related expenses, including travel to and from the university. She\nadmitted she initiated the account but charged only about $60 on the card (Tr. 99).\nApplicant denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.l, but not the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m.  Based on the credit\n2\nreports, they likely all pertain to the same debt. As reported in May 2007 (Ex. 4), the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.l\nreported a $2,349 debt balance for collection in November 2004. The collection agency in SOR \u00b6 1.m opened\nits account in November 2004 with a balance of $2,350. The named original creditor, Associates, is likely a\nprior assignee. The creditor named in SOR \u00b6 1.a then obtained a judgment of $2,349 in April 2007, which is\nthe reported balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l. The updated credit report of June 25, 2008, reports only the\n$2,349 judgment and does not include either of the creditors named in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l or 1.m.\n2\nuntil January 2009 due to the unexpected hospitalization of her newborn. Then\nassigned Department Counsel Gina Marine did not object, and on October 9, 2008, I\ngranted her request. On December 8, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for January 8, 2009.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Four government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and\nthree Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C) were admitted. Applicant and her spouse testified, as\nreflected in a transcript received on January 28, 2009. The record was held open until\nJanuary 26, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. On January 23,\n2009, Applicant submitted a statement concerning creditor contacts and her plans to\nrepay outstanding accounts (Ex. D), a current personal financial statement (Ex. E), a\nrecent wage and earnings statement for her spouse (Ex. F) and herself (Ex. G), and a\ncharacter reference letter (Ex. H). Department Counsel did not object and the\ndocuments were marked and admitted into the record as noted. Based on a review of\nthe SOR, Answer, transcript, and documentary exhibits, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $18,853 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.s). Applicant denied the debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o, but admitted the other debts. After\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old business operations clerk who has worked on a U.S.\nmilitary installation since March 2007. She stayed on in her position after the company\nthat had hired her lost the contract (Tr. 81, 114). Applicant has an interim security\nclearance for her duties (Tr. 81).\nIn the fall of 1998, Applicant began undergraduate studies at a public university.\nShe financed her education through student loans totaling about $50,496 (Ex. 4), some\nfinancial support from her parents, and seasonal income as a sales associate for a\ndepartment store over the holidays in 1999 (Ex. 1). She obtained several credit card\naccounts in her name over the 1998/99 time frame (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l,  1.n, 1.p,\n1\n2\n1.q, and 1.r) (Ex. 4). Applicant paid her credit card bills on time until 2001. In November\n2000, she lost her student research position after the professor for whom she had been\nworking left the university (Ex. 1, Tr. 83).\n\n3\nIn June 2001, Applicant transferred to another campus of the same university\n(Ex. 1). Her father lost his job that fall, and her parents had to reduce their financial\nsupport by 75% (Tr. 84). In addition to working as a student recruiter for the university\nuntil January 2004, Applicant held several other jobs while going to college. She worked\nas a cashier for a lingerie store from July to December 2001, and was a semi-\nprofessional cheerleader part-time from August 2001 to August 2002. Her income was\nnot sufficient to pay off her credit card balances in full each month so she just stopped\npaying on her credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r) (Ex. 4). She\nnotified her creditors that she was unable to pay on her credit cards but they refused her\nrequest to close the accounts and interest continued to accrue (Tr. 102). \nIn February 2003, Applicant and her spouse were married (Ex. 1). He had\nattended college from 1996 to 2000, in part financed through student loans of $20,000.\nHe left before finishing his degree (Tr. 70-71), and went to work for an office supply\nretailer with the intent of entering an assistant manager\u2019s program (Tr. 34-35).  Three\ndays after their marriage, Applicant\u2019s spouse was deployed with his reserve unit. He\nwas called up until about July 2003 (Tr. 37). Applicant stayed in school. She worked that\nsummer as a junior budget analyst from May 2003 to October 2003 (Ex. 1), but made\nno payments toward the credit card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r that\nhad been delinquent since 2001/02. In December 2003, one of her credit lenders\nobtained a $2,656 judgment against her (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Ex. 4). Applicant appeared in\ncourt with her father and promised to pay the debt (Tr. 98).\nIn March 2004, Applicant and her spouse had their first child (Ex. 1). His medical\ninsurance did not cover the full costs of her unexpected cesarean delivery (Tr. 89). A\nmedical debt of $1,968 was subsequently placed for collection in April 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d)\n(Ex. 4, Tr. 89). Additional medical debts of $109 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) $161 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) $125\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $225 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) from 2004 were placed for collection (Exs. 3, 4).\nFaced with the choice of staying with the office supply retailer in the hope of\nbecoming a salaried employee or of going on active duty in the military, Applicant\u2019s\nspouse enlisted as an active duty soldier in August 2004. He is a light wheel mechanic\n(Tr. 123). Ordered to report for active duty in January 2005, he asked for a cash\nadvance to cover the costs of the family\u2019s relocation. Due to an error, he was paid an\nadvance of two months\u2019 pay. He assumed the second advance was some type of\nentitlement, but discovered that he had to repay the total amount at $336 per month. So\nthat he could obtain the clearance he needed for his military duties, he focused on\nrepaying some of his debts, which did not include his student loan debt from 1996 that\ndue to interest had doubled from its original $20,000 (Tr. 70). Applicant\u2019s delinquent\ndebts went unpaid (Exs. 3, 4, Tr. 37-38, 40). In November 2004, a collection agency\nthat had held Applicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l placed the unpaid balance for collection with\n\nThis is likely the $1,500 credit card debt Applicant listed on her SF 86 (Ex. 1). The obligee named\n3\nby her on the SF 86 does not appear on either of her credit reports. She testified she had two Visa cards (the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.h and the debt she listed on her SF 86, Tr. 104).\n4\nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.m. Another credit card debt of $1,060 (SOR \u00b6 1.n) was placed\nas well with the same collection agency (Ex. 4).3\nIn May 2005, Applicant dropped out of college and joined her spouse at his duty\nstation. She was expecting their second child, and had no earned income. She could\nnot find a job that would pay her enough to compensate for the cost of daycare (Tr. 115-\n16). In September 2005, they had a son (Ex. 1, Tr. 38). Their financial struggles\ncontinued despite his E-5 salary. In 2006, they began to fall behind in their bills.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse accepted financial assistance from the Red Cross that he had to\nrepay at $84 per month for the next two years (Tr. 41-42, 52).\nIn June 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse began to make payments of $178 per month to\ntake his student loans out of forbearance with the intent of eventually finishing his\ndegree under the military\u2019s education benefit. He made payments for about a year (Tr.\n54-56, 70-71). As of January 2009, he owed about $45,000 in student loan debt largely\ndue to interest (Tr. 59). He was in the process of negotiating with the lender to resume\npayments that he could afford so that he can reenroll in college (Tr. 55).\nIn November 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse received orders to transfer to the\nNortheast (Ex. 1, Tr. 42, 52). He obtained a loan that he used to replace his 1992 Geo\nStorm (Ex. 53) with a 2000 Ford Explorer (they also had a 1998 Passat, Tr. 123-24),\nand to temporarily move his family to his in-laws\u2019 home in the Midwest. Initially,\nrepayment of the loan was at $164.99 per month for 36 months, although his monthly\nobligation increased to $181.90 in July 2007 after he missed a payment (Ex. B, Tr. 45).\nIn January or February 2007, he took a cash advance of one month\u2019s pay to cover the\ncosts of moving his family to their present locale. He had just about paid off his Red\nCross loan (Tr. 44). In April 2007, a medical provider placed an unpaid debt of\nApplicant\u2019s for collection in the amount of $469 (Ex. 4).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse primarily handled the family\u2019s finances until he was deployed\nto Iraq in late March 2008 (Tr. 57-58, 110, 127). While he was in Iraq, she had to spend\n$2,300 to repair the Explorer (Tr. 124). In response to DOHA interrogatories inquiring\nabout her unpaid debt, Applicant explained in June 2008 that she and her spouse had\nbeen paying off his debts over the past year; that since his debts had been paid off in\nMay 2008, they would be able to concentrate on her debts (Ex. 2).\nFollowing the birth of their third child in 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse was granted\nemergency leave to return to the U.S. in early September 2008. Their infant daughter\nwas hospitalized for a couple of weeks for treatment of a life-threatening illness (Tr. 59-\n61). Since her discharge, they have incurred early intervention costs (clinical\nassessments) for their daughter that are not covered by insurance (Tr. 61). \n\nSee footnotes 2 and 3, supra.\n4\n5\nStarting in October 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse has been paid at the E-6 rate. He\nwas recently released from duty in Iraq (Tr. 64), and his hazardous location pay, hazard\nduty pay, and family separation pay ($575 total, Ex. F) will end in February 2009 (Ex.\nD). He expects he may have to repay some of those entitlements (Tr. 60).\nApplicant and her spouse live on a military installation, so his housing allowance\nof $1,765 per month is taken directly out of his pay (Tr. 48-49). Daycare costs of $834\nevery two weeks and automobile insurance at $122 per month are paid by Applicant out\nof her earnings. Her net remainder of about $378 every two weeks goes toward\ngroceries, gasoline, diapers, formula, and whatever else may be needed in the\nhousehold (Tr. 119). Her spouse usually pays the cable television ($140 per month) and\ncellular phone costs ($85 per month) (Tr. 50-51) in addition to the $182 loan repayment\n(Tr. 109). On occasion, she will give him some of her money if he needs it for\nunexpected expenses like car repairs (Tr. 121-22). Neither Applicant nor her spouse\nhas an active credit card account (Tr. 95, 130). They do not fully agree on how to\nhandle their financial affairs (Tr. 78, 127). As of her hearing, Applicant had not\ncontacted any of the creditors listed in the SOR. She planned to pay off her smaller\ndebts first (Tr. 99-100). As of May 2008, her student loans, which had a balance of\n$49,099, were in deferred status (Ex. 3).\nFollowing her hearing, Applicant contacted the creditor that had held those\naccounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r. The accounts were no longer in the creditor\u2019s\nrecords and she was advised to dispute them with the credit bureaus. If she is informed\nshe does not have to repay them, she intends to pursue debt consolidation to resolve\nthe four larger credit card debts she recognizes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.m and 1.n)  (Ex. D).\n4\nAs of the pay period ending December 19, 2008, Applicant\u2019s gross pay for the year\ntotaled $22,529.10 (Ex. G). Her spouse\u2019s Medicare/security wages for 2008 totaled\n$31,818.20. His monthly take home pay for December 2008 was $1,665.39 (Ex. F). On\nJanuary 26, 2009, Applicant estimated that she and her spouse had joint monthly\ndiscretionary funds of $766.82 after paying expenses and the $182 monthly loan (Ex.\nE).\nApplicant has been an \u201cavid volunteer\u201d at the daycare center on base. In 2008,\nshe was in charge of organizing several important events at the center and she fulfilled\nthose duties responsibly (Ex. C). A senior acquisitions\u2019 security specialist familiar with\nApplicant\u2019s work since March 2007 has found her to be very professional in carrying out\nher duties. She is aware that Applicant has financial difficulties and she does not doubt\nApplicant\u2019s intention to resolve her debts (Ex. C, Ex. H).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\n\n6\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\n7\nApplicant does not dispute that she incurred delinquent balances on seven credit\ncard accounts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i, two VISA card accounts that are likely those\ncollection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r. Whether or not\nher parents incurred the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, she is legally responsible for the judgment\nbalance as well since the account was in her name. She appeared in court with her\nfather and promised to pay the debt with his assistance but did not do so (Tr. 98).\nApplicant also admits unpaid medical debt totaling about $3,057 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e,\n1.f, 1.g, and 1.r). As of January 2009, those debts, totaling about $14,000, had not been\npaid. Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nThe government did not meet its burden of proving that Applicant owed the\nadditional $4,854 in disputed debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o. As noted\nin footnote 2, supra, although the amounts differ, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.l are\nlikely the same debt as the collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. Applicant did not recognize\nany debt to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.k or the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j. She\nacknowledged having had cellular phone service in college with the creditor that had\nreferred a $224 debt for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.o), but she denied any knowledge of an\noutstanding balance. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.o are not included on\nher more recent June 2008 credit report (Ex. 3). However, AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d does not mitigate the $14,000 in\nproven debt.\nApplicant\u2019s credit card accounts became delinquent over the 2001/02 time frame,\nwhen she was unmarried, attending college, and working at minimum wages. Yet, AG\n20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be fully applied in\nmitigation because of her more recent delinquent medical debt, including the $1,968\nhospital bill incurred in the birth of her first child, and the fact that her debts have yet to\nbe resolved.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is implicated. The loss of her student\nresearch employment, the significant drop in financial assistance from her parents after\nher father lost his job in 2001, the low wages paid her when she was employed while in\nschool from 2001 to 2005, insufficient medical insurance to cover an unexpected C-\nsection in March 2004, and her inability to find a job that would pay her enough to cover\ndaycare costs at her spouse\u2019s first active duty station, are all factors outside of her\ncontrol that led to the delinquencies and then her failure to resolve the debts in a timely\nmanner.\n\nApplicant\u2019s financial situation cannot fairly be evaluated without taking into account her spouse\u2019s\n5\nincome and his debt obligations, as they affect her finances. Daycare costs ($1,668 per month), which she\ncovers, amount to more than half of her monthly take-home pay ($1,349.68 every two weeks).\n8\nFor AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, Applicant must have acted responsibly to address\nher debts once she was in a position to do so. Applicant did not work outside of the\nhome and the family needed a loan from the Red Cross to pay their bills in 2006. At the\nsame time, her spouse began repaying his student loan in June 2006 in an effort to\nbring it out of forbearance so that he could return to school. Any available funds during\nthat time also went to pay off some of her spouse\u2019s debt so that he could obtain the\nsecurity clearance he needed for the military. Even after Applicant began working in\nMarch 2007, she did not have the funds to devote to her old debts.\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated in June 2008 that they\nhad paid off her spouse\u2019s debt and would be able to concentrate on her delinquent\naccounts. She had not contacted her creditors before her hearing in January 2009, but\nher spouse\u2019s deployment, the birth of their third child that summer, and then her\nnewborn\u2019s life-threatening illness, are significant extenuating factors. Although she\nprobably could have paid the smaller medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f,  AG \u00b6\n20(b) applies in part.\nBefore the record closed, Applicant provided a statement indicating she had\ncontacted one lender in an effort to make payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p. 1.q,\nand 1.r. On the advice of the creditor, who was unable to confirm any outstanding\nbalances, Applicant disputed them with Trans Union. Assuming she will not be required\nto repay those debts, her debt burden would be reduced by only $898. While these\nefforts post-hearing to address her indebtedness are not enough in and of themselves\nto qualify for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d or AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d the evidence warrants partial\napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) taking the household as a whole.  Applicant\u2019s\n5\nspouse, who  handled repayment of old debt obligations until he went to Iraq, focused\non repaying his debts first. His debts have been resolved with the exception of his\nstudent loans. Applicant and her spouse have yet to fully agree as to how to handle\nsome of their financial obligations, but they do not rely on consumer credit and there is\nno evidence of extravagant expenditure.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n9\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for\nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts\nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in\nthe SOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant has \u201ca meaningful track record\u201d of paying her current financial obligations, and\nshe has a credible and realistic plan to pay her delinquent debt.\nApplicant candidly acknowledged the existence of delinquent debt, including\nconsumer credit obligations incurred when she was in college. Her failure to repay this\ndebt to date was reasonably explained, however. Despite full time employment since\nMarch 2007, most of her income has gone to child care, car insurance, and essential\nexpenses for the care of their children. Applicant needed her spouse\u2019s agreement and\nfinancial assistance to resolve her old debts, and he was focused on his old debts. They\ncould ill afford jeopardizing his clearance by ignoring the debt he brought into the\nmarriage or incurred in moving the family for his military career. While she had some\ncontrol over their finances following his deployment to Iraq in March 2008, she incurred\n$2,300 in unexpected auto repair expenses. Although she indicated in June 2008 that\n\n10\nthey could begin to repay her debts, she had the day-to-day responsibilities of a single\nparent caring for two preschool age children and then a newborn who became ill with a\nlife-threatening illness. Her spouse returned from Iraq in early September 2008, but they\nwere understandably focused on their daughter.\nAs of her hearing in January 2009, Applicant\u2019s spouse had been released from\nfurther duty in Iraq, and their infant had recovered sufficiently to attend daycare.\nCertainly, Applicant would have had a stronger case in mitigation had she started\nrepaying her delinquent debts. However, she expressed a credible plan to pay off her\nsmaller debts first and then obtain a consolidation loan to resolve the others. Before the\nrecord closed in this case, she contacted the lender who had extended credit to her on\nthe smaller accounts that she planned to pay off first. She is unlikely to have contacted\nthe lender unless she planned to repay the debts. The corporate security manager who\nhandled Applicant\u2019s request for clearance with their previous employer does not doubt\nApplicant\u2019s intent to resolve her old debts. The concerted efforts by Applicant and her\nspouse to satisfy his delinquent debts and to live within their means indicate that they\nboth understand the importance of addressing her debt as well.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant (Duplication of \u00b6 1.m)\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant (Duplication of \u00b6 1.m)\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\n\n11\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 27, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  On January 29,\n2009, after considering the written record,  Administrative Judge Rita C. O\u2019Brien denied Applicant\u2019s\n1\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under SOR subparagraphs 1(h), (p), and (u) are not at issue in this appeal.\n2\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed an appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are based upon substantial evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n2\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts, despite the fact that certain\ndebts listed in the SOR were repeats of others.  Applicant\u2019s gross annual pay is $32,485 and her net\nis $20,000.  Applicant has entered into an agreement with a debt consolidation program.  She is a\n46 year-old divorced mother of three.\nApplicant argues that \u201cthe amount of my debt is not correctly listed.\u201d  She asserts that she\ndoes not have over $100,000 in debt and that some of the items (debts) are duplicated.  The Board\nconstrues Applicant\u2019s statement as a claim that the Judge incorrectly found that she has $100,000\nin debt.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision reveals that the Judge never made an explicit finding that\nApplicant had $100,000 in debt.  Rather than make a specific finding on the total amount of\nApplicant\u2019s debt, the Judge referenced the fact that the SOR alleged 21 debts which totaled more\nthan $100,000.  The Judge noted that Applicant disputed the $100,000 total and claimed that her\nactual total delinquent debt amounted to approximately $73,000.  Thus, the Judge was aware of\nApplicant\u2019s admission that she had $ 73,000 in debt, and, since the Judge made no finding as to the\naggregate amount of Applicant\u2019s debt, there is nothing in the decision to indicate that the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis and conclusions were based on a finding that Applicant had $100,000 in debt.  Indeed, the\nJudge found that some of the debts listed in the credit reports are duplicates.  Given this, and\ninasmuch as Applicant admitted to $73,000 in debt, the Board concludes that, after a review of the\nrecord evidence in this case, the $27,000 discrepancy between the amount alleged in the SOR and\nthe amount admitted to by Applicant did not materially alter the Judge\u2019s analysis or conclusions in\nthe case.  In fact, the Judge\u2019s found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding several of the allegations in the\nSOR and ultimately found against Applicant on only $53,350 of debt.  Applicant has not established\nharmful error on the part of the Judge.  \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Applicant asserts that the Judge erred concerning the amount\nshe owes for child support payments.  However, the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor under the SOR\nallegation pertaining to this matter.  Therefore, even if the Judge\u2019s finding of fact was erroneous, it\nwas harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 06-23112 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 2007); ISCR Case No. 00-0250\nat 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2001).   \nIn support of her appeal Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the record,\nwhich the Board cannot consider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or\nconsidered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  The Judge\u2019s decision, viewed in light of the record as a whole,\n\n\u201cApplicant is . . . a mature, responsible adult.  She accrued significant debt over the past several years.  In\n3\nresponse to the government\u2019s concerns she offered proof that she pays one debt: her child support arrearage, which is\npaid by garnishment.  She also offered proof that she signed an agreement with a debt-relief organization, but no record\nevidence of payments.  Absent evidence that the payment plan is underway, and that Applicant has, in fact, begun making\npayments, the government\u2019s security concerns remain.  A fair and common-sense assessment of available information\nbearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows she has not satisfied the doubts about her ability or\nwillingness to protect the government\u2019s interests.  Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \ndraws a rational connection between the facts found and its ultimate denial of a security clearance\nfor Applicant.   See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle\n3\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that\n\u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified\ninformation\u201d is sustainable on this record.

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance\nis denied.\nOn November 28, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP, SF-86 format) to request a security clearance\nrequired as part of her employment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing\nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn August 27, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive\nJanuary 29, 2009\n\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. \n2\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included nine documents (Items 1 - 9) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n Applicant disputes this total, claiming that her delinquent debt amounts to approximately $73,000 (see notes\n4\non copy of FORM in Applicant\u2019s Reply to FORM).\n2\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG).\nApplicant received the SOR (Item 1) on September 8, 2008. She signed her\nAnswer on September 15, 2008, in which she admitted to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g., 1.i.,\nand 1.k. through 1.u. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j. In her Answer, Applicant also\nnoted that 1.c., 1.e., 1.j. 1.p., and possibly 1.u. were duplicate allegations. She did not\nindicate whether she wished to have a hearing or have her case decided on the record.\nAs neither Applicant nor the government requested a hearing,  the case was assigned\n2\nto me on January 21, 2009, for an administrative decision based on the record.\nOn December 29, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant was\n3\ngiven 30 days from the date she received the FORM to file a response. The government\ndid not object to Applicant\u2019s response, which was timely received on January 9, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old mother of three. She married in 1982, and divorced in\n1993. Her three sons are 14, 21 and 24 years old. Her two oldest sons are from a prior\nmarriage and she pays child support arrearages (Item 4). She attended one semester of\ncollege in 1999. Applicant was employed as a receptionist from 1997 to summer 2007,\nand completed her Security Clearance Application as part of that employment (Items 5;\n6). As of July 2008, she worked for another defense contractor (Item 6). The file does\nnot include information on whether or not she was employed from summer 2007 to\nsummer 2008.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes 21 debts, which total more than $100,0004\n(Items 7, 8 and 9). In her Answer, Applicant admits to 19 debts. She denies allegation\n1.j., stating that it is a duplicate of 1.e. However, in her Reply to the FORM, she\nindicates that it is allegation 1.r. that is actually the duplication of 1.e., noting that \u201cThis\nis item (e) on previous pg. Amount is after truck was sold.\u201d (Reply, Item 1) She also\ncontends that allegations 1.c. and 1.p. are duplicates of other alleged debts, but does\n\nIn its FORM, the government \n5\n3\nnot state which debt each duplicates. She claims that 1.u. might be a duplicate, without\nfurther explanation (Item 4).  \n5\nApplicant denies the $44,000 child support delinquency alleged in the SOR,\nstating that the account is current, and that she pays it monthly through payroll\ndeduction. In her Answer, she notes that the amount owed is $38,000, but in her Reply\nto the FORM, she lists the current debt as $36,000 (Reply, Item 1). She also states in\nher Answer that her income tax refunds are applied to her child support debt.\nApplicant claims that all the debts, except the child support, are in a debt\nconsolidation program (Item 4). In her response to DOHA Interrogatories in June 2008,\nApplicant noted that she had \u201cjoined a debt-relief program to correct my outstanding\ndebt\u201d and that she would be \u201ccompletely out of debt within 5 years.\u201d (Item 6). She\nprovided the name of a law firm as the point of contact, but did not forward\ndocumentation showing her enrollment. Three months later, with her Answer of\nSeptember 15, 2008, she again stated that she was \u201ctrying to consolidate and pay off\u201d\nher debts, and that she had obtained the services of a debt-relief organization. She\nprovided the following documentation: an agreement signed on September 15, 2008;\ninstructions on making payments; and a list of debts to be included in the plan. The list\nof debts in the agreement duplicates the debt list in the SOR, and the agreement was\nsigned on the day Applicant wrote her Answer to the SOR. The file contains no\ndocumentation of payments made or any further contact with the agency between\nSeptember 2008 and Applicant\u2019s Reply to the FORM in January 2009.\nApplicant did not provide a Personal Financial Statement, as requested,\nHowever, based on her earning statement of July 2008 (Item 6), her gross monthly pay\nis approximately $2,707, or approximately $32,485 annually. Her net monthly pay is\n$1,668, or approximately $20,000 annually. Her earning statement also shows a\ngarnishment of $280.85 per pay period, or approximately $562 per month. She states\nthat this garnishment is applied to her child support debt (Item 6).\nApplicant noted in her Interrogatory response that she \u201crecently went through a\nmarital breakup and due to the financial situation I fell behind on things.\u201d (Item 6). In her\nAnswer to the SOR she referred to the same situation, noting that, \n\u201cA couple of years ago I was going through a bad\nrelationship break up after 12 years... The one thing that did\nhappen to me is my live in boyfriend whom I have a son with\n(age 13) walked out on us about 3 years ago and I could not\nkeep up with my payments. I do not receive any child\nsupport from him and I could not pay all of these bills, part of\nthem are his, just in my name.\u201d (Item 4).\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n4\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n6\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n8\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.9\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\n\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nBased on the evidence contained in the FORM, disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619\n(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) apply. The credit bureau reports show that most of Applicant\u2018s\ndebts became delinquent around 2005 and 2006, and they still appear on her 2008\nreports (Items 7, 8 and 9), showing she has a history of being unable or unwilling to\nmeet her financial obligations.\nThe following conditions that can potentially mitigate security concerns are\nrelevant: AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay her numerous delinquencies did not occur in the distant\npast, because they are still delinquent. Although Applicant appears to have signed an\nagreement with a debt counseling organization, she provided proof only that she is\nmaking payments on one of the SOR debts, child support, through garnishment of her\npay. Given her failure to provide evidence of that she has actually started to make\npayments on the remaining debts, her reliability remains in question. AG \u00b6 20a cannot\nbe applied.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20(b) is relevant because Applicant experienced a difficult break-up of her\nrelationship with her son\u2019s father, which left her unable to handle the family debts on her\nown, a condition that was beyond her control. From her statement that it occurred about\n3 years ago, the break-up appears to have taken place in approximately 2005. The\ncredit bureau reports show that most of her delinquencies happened in the 2005-2006\ntime frame (Items 7, 8 and 9). Therefore, it does appear that the loss of her partner\u2019s\nsupport affected her ability to pay her debts. However, to be applicable, this mitigating\ncondition requires that the person act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to contact a debt-relief agency until she received the Statement of Reasons three\nyears later, and her failure to provide evidence of actual payments on her debts, do not\ndemonstrate responsible action. AG \u00b6 20 (b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20c is relevant because Applicant claims she has a payment plan in effect\nto resolve her debts. However, AG \u00b6 20c cannot be applied because it also requires\nevidence that the problem is under control. Applicant has provided no such evidence.\nAG \u00b6 20d is also relevant because Applicant contacted a debt-relief agency to\nbegin resolving her delinquencies. However, the record is insufficient to support a claim\nthat she made a good-faith effort to pay her debts. For instance, she stated in June\n2008 that she had started a debt-relief program, but provided only the name of a law\nfirm, with no further evidence that she followed through with that firm and began a\nprogram (Item 6). She apparently sought out a different debt-relief agency in September\n2008. However, the record contains no proof that she has done more than sign an\nagreement. There is no evidence that Applicant actually began making payments on\nany debts in the plan. The fact that she signed the agreement on the day she submitted\nher Answer, and that the debt list is simply a copy of the debts as listed in the SOR,\nindicate that Applicant engaged in a last-minute attempt to show some evidence of\npayment efforts. Finally, between her Answer in September 2008, and her Reply in\nJanuary 2009, she had an opportunity to make payments to show that a plan was\nunderway, but she took no action on any debt during those four months. Without\nevidence to support her claim of paying her debts through a payment program, and with\nonly a promise of doing better in the future (Item 4), mitigation is not available under AG\n\u00b6 20d.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) is also relevant. Applicant disputes several allegations, contending\nthey are duplicates of debts alleged elsewhere in the Statement of Reasons. The\nevidence supports Applicant\u2019s claim in part. The credit bureau reports show that 1.c.\nand 1.p. are duplicates, as well as 1.k. and 1.u. (Items 8 and 9). However, the evidence\ndoes not support Applicant\u2019s contention that 1.e. and 1.j. are duplicates. AG \u00b6 20(e)\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and\nall the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is 46 years old and presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. She\naccrued significant debt over the past several years. In response to the government\u2019s\nconcerns she offered proof that she pays one debt: her child support arrearage, which is\npaid by garnishment. She also offered proof that she signed an agreement with a debt-\nrelief organization, but no record evidence of payments. Absent evidence that the\npayment plan is underway, and that Applicant has, in fact, begun making payments, the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns remain. A fair and common-sense assessment of the\navailable information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows\nshe has not satisfied the doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in\nthese determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a: - 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i - 1.o.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nFor Applicant (duplicate of 1.c.)\nSubparagraph 1.q. - 1.t.\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u.\nFor Applicant (duplicate of 1.k.)\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is denied.\nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN\nAdministrative Judge\n\n8\n",

On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on April 21, 2008.  The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on April 23, 2008.  \nApplicant received the FORM on May 4, 2008. He had 30 days from receipt of the \nFORM to submit any additional material.  He did not respond.

(Item 6 at 3.) In his answer to the SOR, he states the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is resolved but provided nothing to verify the debt is paid. He is looking into \nthe other accounts. He states that in six months 98% of the debts listed will be resolved.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe states he is not a deadbeat. He has been making car payments for two years and he \nhas paid several old debts not alleged in the SOR. (Item 3.)   \n \nApplicant did not indicate that he had delinquent debts on his application for a \nposition of public trust or on his e-QIP application because he was not aware of the \ndelinquent debt because his ex-wife handled all of the bills. Applicant married in August \n2003 and divorced in April 2006. (Item 3; Item 4, Section 13/15.) Applicant encountered \ntwo periods of unemployment, from March 2001 to November 2001, and from March \n2006 to June 2006. (Item 4, Section 11.) He provided no information about his work \nperformance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since \n2001, Applicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations. He incurred numerous \ndelinquent accounts that remain unresolved. The SOR alleged 18 delinquent accounts \nthat were either charged off or placed for collection with a total approximate balance of \n$10,527.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility goes back to at least 2001. His history of \nfinancial irresponsibility casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  Applicants financial issues remain. He has not provided proof that any of the \ndebts are resolved.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) is considered because Applicant endured \ntwo periods of unemployment. He was unemployed for seven months in 2001 and for \nthree months in 2006. He underwent a divorce a few years ago and several of the \ndelinquent accounts appear to be medical debts. However, Applicant provided no \nexplanation as to how he encountered his financial problems. He did not explain \nwhether the medical bills were incurred as a result of an unexpected medical \nemergency or were for routine medical appointments. He took no steps to resolve any \nof the delinquent accounts so it cannot be concluded that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. FC MC \u00b620(b) does not apply.   \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling.  It is unlikely \nthat his financial problems will be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Applicant indicates that he intends \nto resolve these accounts but has provided no verification that any of the delinquent \naccounts were resolved. I cannot conclude that Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to \nresolve his overdue accounts.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligation to his creditors remains a \nsecurity concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his \ndelinquent debts that were over 180 days old in response to section 28(a) and his \ndelinquent debts that were currently 90 days old in response to section 28(b) on his e-\nQIP application, dated February 28, 2007. He also did not list his delinquent debts that \nwere over 180 days old in response to question 22.b on his application for a position of \npublic trust, dated September 19, 2006. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n \n17(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) potentially applies to this allegation. Applicant claims he was unaware \nof his delinquent debts because his ex-wife handled all the bills during his marriage. The \ndeliberate falsification allegation is based on circumstantial evidence. I find Applicant did \nnot deliberately withhold this information when filling out his e-QIP application and on \nhis application for a position of public trust. I find for Applicant with respect to the \npersonal conduct concern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no information \nabout his work performance. At the close of the record, Applicant provided little \nevidence that he has taken steps to resolve his delinquent accounts. There was \ninsufficient evidence to conclude any of the accounts were resolved. Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nOctober 30, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on December 19, 2006. On July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 11, 2008 and requested a hearing\nbefore DOHA.  This Administrative Judge was assigned the matter on August 27, 2008.\nA notice of hearing was issued on September 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing for\nOctober 7, 2008. The Government offered eleven exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 11, which were received without objection. Applicant offered five\nexhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E, and he testified on his own\nbehalf.  The record remained open until October 21, 2008, to allow the Applicant the\nopportunity to submit additional documentation.  He submitted two Post-Hearing\nExhibits, referred to as Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B.  DOHA received the transcript of\n\n2\nthe hearing (Tr.) on October 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 52 years old and has a Bachelors of Science Degree in\nAeronautical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Aeronautical\nEngineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\n          The Applicant began his current employment in January 2005.  His past criminal\nhistory includes five separate arrests, charges and convictions for various criminal\noffenses related to the possession and/or use of illegal drugs or alcohol.  \nHis most recent arrest occurred in January 2004, when he was charged with\nBeing Under the Influence of a Controlled Substance.  Applicant admits that at the time\nof his arrest, he was under the influence of methamphetamine.  He pled guilty and was\nsentenced to probation for three years and fined. \nIn August 2003, he was charged with (1) Possession of a Controlled Substance,\na felony, (2) Under the Influence of a Controlled Substance, and (3) Controlled\nSubstance Paraphernalia.  The Applicant had been using methamphetamine prior to his\narrest.  He pled nolo contendere to Count 1 and was found guilty.  He was sentenced to\nthree years probation and fined.  \nIn October 1994, the Applicant was charged with (1) Driving While Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol or Drugs, and (2) Driving with a BAC of over .08% and under .20%\nof alcohol.  He was found guilty of Count 1, and was sentenced to three years probation\nand fined.\nHe was arrested in November 1985, and charged with Driving While Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol or Drugs.  He was found guilty of alcohol related recklessness and\nwas sentenced to one year probation and fined.\nHe was arrested in October 1982, and charged with (1) Possession of a\nControlled Substance - Cocaine, (2) Possession of a Controlled Substance - Psilocybin,\nand (3) Possession of a Controlled Substance - Cannabis.  The Applicant explained that\nhe was on his way to a birthday party at a bar for a friend.  He had a gift of psilocybin to\ngive to his friend as a present.  He missed a turn signal and was ultimately arrested and\nbooked by police.  (Government Exhibit 4).  He was placed on a diversion program.  \n\n3\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant was introduced to marijuana by a high school friend.  He used\nmarijuana from 1980 until at least 1983 at times weekly.  He stopped associating with\nhis friends who used marijuana, and he quit using it.  In a statement to the DoD in 1985,\nthe Applicant stated that he had absolutely no intention of future use of marijuana or any\nother illegal drug.  (Government Exhibit 4).   \nIn July 2003, the Applicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.  He took\na leave of absence from work to help her through treatment, and was subsequently laid\noff from work.  This caused financial difficulties including a bankruptcy, and the loss of\nhis house.  His two children who had been living with him had to go live with their\nmother.  He became depressed and started using methamphetamine to help deal with\nthe situation.  From about July 2003 to at least October 2004, he used\nmethamphetamine one to four times weekly.  He then stopped associating with this\ngroup of friends, and he quit using methamphetamine.  He indicates that he has been\ncompletely sober and drug free for the past four years and he has no intentions of ever\nusing any illegal drugs in the future. \nFollowing his most recent arrest in January 2004, the Applicant indicates that he\nhas completed a state funded program for drug abusers known as \u201cProp. 36\".  He\ndescribed the program as a \u201cone to two year drug treatment program that consisted of\nclasses and meetings, and upon completion, the pending felony was reduced to a\nmisdemeanor\u201d.  (Tr. p. 35).  The record was left open after the hearing to give the\nApplicant the opportunity to submit documentation concerning this recovery program.\nHe submitted a copy of the court docket that includes his progress reports from the\nProposition 36 program.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B).  The Applicant also\nsubmitted a signed and notarized affidavit or Statement of Intent that indicates that he\nwill not use any methamphetamine or any other controlled substance in the future and\nthat he understands and agrees that if he does, it will result in the automatic revocation\nof his security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).  \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated December 19, 2006.  (Government Exhibit 9).  Question 23\n(d) of the application asked the Applicant, have you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  The  Applicant answered, \u201cYES\u201d\nand listed his felony arrest for August 20, 2003.  He failed to list his charges and\nconvictions in 1994 for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and in 2004\nfor being under the influence of a controlled substance.  (See Government Exhibit 9).\nThe Applicant explained that he thought the question was asking him to disclose only\narrests that may have occurred within the last seven years and that he obviously\nmisread the question.  (Tr. pp. 50-51).  Under the circumstances, I do not find that this\nexcuse has any merit.  The Applicant should have disclosed his complete criminal\nhistory.           \n\n4\nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s direct manager, coworkers and\nprofessional colleagues indicate that the Applicant has gone through some hard times in\nthe past but that he has persevered through dedication and hard work and has\nsuccessfully completed all of the sentencing requirements imposed by the court.  The\nApplicant is considered to be a dedicated employee who is timely, reliable and\ntrustworthy.  He is also said to be a responsible family man who lives a well balanced\nlife.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C and D). \nApplicant has received four cash awards from his employer for outstanding\nperformance on the job on January 22, 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Tr. p. 56). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\n5\n22.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed\nin Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d                                               \n              \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct, drug involvement and dishonesty that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the\nfinding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or\nmitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant\nhas  engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J), drug involvement (Guideline H),  and\npersonal conduct (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope\nand nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines J, H and E of the SOR.\n\n7\nThe evidence shows that over the past twenty-two years, the Applicant has been\narrested and convicted on five separate occasions for drug or alcohol related offenses,\nthe most recent of these arrests occurred just four years ago.  On that occasion, the\nApplicant was arrested for Being Under the Influence of Methamphetamine.  Under\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions, 31.(a) a single serious crime or\nmultiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted apply.  None\nof the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, Guideline J is found against the\nApplicant.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25.(a) any drug\nabuse, 25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 22.(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  Applicant told the Government\nin 1985 that he had no intentions of further illegal drug use, but he returned to using\ndrugs, in 2004, this time, methamphetamine.  Applicant\u2019s states that his last use of any\nillegal drug was in 2004, and that he has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug\nagain.  He has completed the Proposition 36 program, and is making progress in his\nrehabilitation.  However, given the extensive nature of his drug use and the fact that he\nreturned to using illegal drugs when he told the Government in the past that he would not\nuse them, raises questions as to whether he can remain drug free.  The Applicant is on\nthe correct path, however, more time in rehabilitation is needed to demonstrate to the\nGovernment that he will not return to using illegal drugs.  Given the circumstances of this\ncase, I find his past use of illegal drugs to be recent and of security significance.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16.(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.\nApplicant\u2019s excuse for not listing his entire criminal history on his security clearance\napplication is not reasonable and therefore has no merit.  Based upon the evidence\npresented, I find that the Applicant deliberately concealed this information from the\nGovernment on his security clearance application.  Consequently, Guideline E is found\nagainst the Applicant.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  It is noted that he is respected and admired\nby his manager and colleagues.  However, under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and a lack\nof candor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the\n\n8\nApplicant under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), H (Drug Involvement), and E (Personal\nConduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the SOR.                                              \n                \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                      \nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Robert R. Bohn, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s failed to mitigate the security concern generated by his fascination\nwith stories involving incestuous sexual encounters with children. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn May 6, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing one allegation under Guideline D,\nSexual Behavior, cross-alleged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The SOR also\nincluded one additional Guideline E allegation. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 29, 2011\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on May 27, 2010, denying the Sexual Conduct\nallegation and admitting the Personal Conduct allegation. He requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to another administrative judge on January 25, 2011. A notice of\nhearing was issued on February 8, 2011, scheduling the hearing for February 24, 2011.\nAfter a change of venue, the hearing was cancelled. On February 24, 2011, the case\nwas transferred to me. On March 4, 2011, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling\nthe case for March 30, 2011. The hearing was held as scheduled, and I received 11\nGovernment exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on April 7,  2011.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41-year-old married man with three children, ages four, two, and\none. He has an associate\u2019s degree, earned in 1995, and a master\u2019s degree in networks\nand operating systems, earned in 1999. (Tr. 14) \nFor the past 15 years, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor. He has\nheld a security clearance for this entire time. Currently, he is the leader of a software\nengineering team that develops products \u201cdealing with mostly the display, query, and\ndissemination of satellite imagery.\u201d (Tr. 17)\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. He has earned various performance\nawards over the years. (GE 5 at 6-9; AE D) According to his supervisor, he \u201cgenerates\neffective solutions to problems [and] makes sound business decisions.\u201d (AE E at 2)\nIn approximately 2003, Applicant and his wife travelled to a South American\ncountry in the Andes mountains. Shortly after arriving, they became debilitated by\nsevere altitude sickness. The hotel staff prepared them coca-leaf tea, a pre-Columbian\nfolk remedy for altitude sickness. (Tr. 74; GE 11 at 9) The tea relieved their altitude\nsickness.\nBecause cocaine is a derivative of the coca leaf, coca-leaf tea is illegal in the\nUnited States. (GE 11 at 9) Applicant was aware of the relationship between coca\nleaves and cocaine when he drank the tea. Once he returned home, he immediately\nreported his consumption of coca-leaf tea to his facility security officer. (Tr. 50)\nApplicant has never used any illegal drugs, either before or after the episode with the\ncoca-leaf tea.\nApplicant enjoys viewing pornography over the Internet. (Tr. 37) Once in 1999\nwhile \u201csurfing pornography,\u201d Applicant \u201ccame across\u201d a picture of a naked child who\nappeared to be approximately six years old. (Tr. 65; GE 6 at 3) He promptly deleted the\nimage. Later, he disclosed this to a polygrapher during an investigation related to his\napplication for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). After the\ndisclosure, Applicant was ordered to undergo a psychological exam. (Tr. 30) Applicant\n\n3\ndid not take the exam. Instead, after consulting with his boss, he withdrew his\napplication for SCI and his boss reassigned him to a project that did not require access\nto SCI. (Tr. 33)\nIn approximately 2004, Applicant downloaded stories from the Internet about\nchildren involved in incestuous sexual activity. (GE 6 at 3) When asked on cross-\nexamination whether these stories were arousing to him, Applicant responded as\nfollows:\nThe parts having to do with children was not. The description of the acts\nwas, if that makes sense. (Tr. 69)\nApplicant did not have any children when he downloaded the stories about\nincest. He has deleted them and has not downloaded any additional stories since 2004.\nHis wife and his boss know about these downloads. (Tr. 42, 53, 57) \nApplicant\u2019s two-year-old child had a twin sibling who passed away approximately\ntwo weeks after birth. (Tr. 69) Devastated by this loss, Applicant and his wife began\nattending grief therapy. \nApproximately three weeks after Applicant\u2019s child died, an adult family member\ndied. Since then, Applicant has been having nightmares that he may have been a victim\nof incest. (Tr. 41) Upon talking with his therapist, Applicant suspects his interest in\nstories about incest stems from the possibility he may have been an incest victim. (Tr.\n43) Applicant continues to receive counseling from his therapist addressing both the\nissues of his child\u2019s death, and the possibility he may be repressing memories of being\nmolested by a family member. (Tr. 42-43) Applicant did not provide any therapist\nrecords.\nApplicant has never committed an act of incest with his children. (Tr. 44) He has\nnever intentionally accessed child pornography. (Tr. 43) Although he used to access\nadult pornography in the past, he has not accessed it since one of his children almost\n\u201cwalked in on [him] looking at naked pictures,\u201d three years ago. (Tr. 44) \nWhen asked during direct examination whether he regretted accessing stories\nabout incest over the Internet, Applicant responded, \u201csince it\u2019s caused this mess, yes.\u201d\n(Tr. 59)\nPolicies\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\n\n4\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d Applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 12) The following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13 are\npotentially applicable:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects a lack of\ndiscretion or judgment.\nThe possession of child pornography constitutes a crime. (State X Code Ann. \u00a7\n374.1:1 (2010)) To constitute child pornography, the material must be sexually explicit\nand visual. (State X Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-374.1A (2010)) Also, it must be reproduced with\n\u201clascivious intent.\u201d (State X Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-374.1C (2010))\n\n5\nThe picture of a naked girl that Applicant came across while surfing the Internet\nfor pornography in 1999 meets the statutory definition of child pornography. However,\nhe was not intentionally seeking child pornography when he came across the picture.\nAlso, he  promptly deleted it. Consequently, no criminal conduct occurred. \nThe stories Applicant downloaded about incest were sexually explicit, and he\nacknowledged downloading them for his sexual gratification. However, they were not\nvisual. Consequently, these stories did not constitute child pornography.\nAlthough the stories Applicant downloaded did not constitute child pornography,\nthey were obscene. (State X Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-372 (2010)) However, possession of\nobscene material absent proof of marketing or distribution does not constitute a crime.\nThe Government presented no evidence that Applicant downloaded the obscene\nmaterial for sale or distribution. (State X Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-374) \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s downloading and possession of stories about incest does\nnot constitute criminal conduct. Therefore, AG \u00b6 13(a) is inapplicable.\nApplicant is receiving therapy, in part, to understand, what compelled him to\ndownload stories about incest. Although this indicates that Applicant\u2019s problem may\nhave a compulsive element, he has not engaged in the conduct for more than six years.\nConsequently, this behavior does not constitute a pattern. AG \u00b6 13(b) is inapplicable. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, boss, and therapist know about the behavior. AG \u00b6 13(c) does\nnot apply.\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s behavior was not public, it did reflect a lack of judgment. AG\n\u00b6 13(d) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s interest in stories about incest is troubling. The nature and\nseriousness of this behavior are not lessened by the fact he has never molested his\nchildren, particularly given that he is still trying to understand, with his therapist\u2019s help,\nwhy stories about incest sexually aroused him.\nApplicant has deleted the stories he downloaded, and has not downloaded any\nadditional stories about incest for more than six years. However, because of the nature\nand seriousness of the conduct, the passage of time does not mitigate the security\nconcern. Applicant explained that his interest in downloading the stories about incest\nmay have stemmed from the possibility he may have himself been an incest victim. His\ntherapy involves, in part, the issue of whether he repressed these memories. \nApplicant provided no records from his therapist detailing the scope of the\ntherapy and the prognosis. Without this information, Applicant\u2019s reassurances and the\n\n6\npassage of time since the conduct last occurred are insufficient to mitigate the security\nconcern.\n \nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15)\nApplicant was given coca-leaf tea by the hotel staff during his Andes mountain\nvacation to combat severe altitude sickness. He had never used illegal drugs before the\nincident, and has not used illegal drugs since the incident. Also, he reported drinking the\ncoca-leaf tea to his facility security officer as soon as he returned from vacation. This\nepisode does not generate a personal conduct security concern.\n Applicant exercised bad judgment when he downloaded stories involving incest.\nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct concerns for the reasons set\nforth in my analysis of the Sexual Behavior guideline.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI have considered the applicability of the whole-person factors in my analysis of\nthe Sexual Behavior guidelines above, and I conclude that they do not warrant a\nfavorable conclusion. In reaching this decision, I also considered Applicant\u2019s troubling\nresponses to questions regarding whether he was sexually aroused by the stories\ninvolving incest, and whether he regretted accessing the stories.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on April 17, 2008. He\nadmitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e, denied the\nremaining allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMay 6, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 21, 2008.  The hearing was conducted as\n2\nscheduled.

Additionally, while the amount alleged in subparagraph 1.a is $1,873, the credit reports indicate\nthe actual amount owing on the February 2005 judgment is in excess of $4,000. The amount alleged in the\nSOR rather than the amount listed in the credit reports is used herein in computing the total amount owed on\nthe judgments. \n2\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-7, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified, called one witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted 1 documentary exhibit\nthat was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) 1, and admitted into the record without\nobjection. The transcript was received on June 2, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 57 years old and has been employed as a mechanical engineer by a\ndefense contractor since February 2007. He retired from employment with a different\ndefense contractor in February 2007. Applicant has possessed a secret level security\nclearance at various times for the past 28 years. No prior adverse action has been taken\nto revoke or downgrade his clearance.\nApplicant married the first time in December 1992. That marriage ended in divorce\nin March 2003. He has two children from that marriage, ages 13 and 14, and pays $1,408\nper month as child support. He has been remarried since March 2003, and has an 11-year-\nold stepchild from this marriage. His wife does not work outside the house.    \nSOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c allege three judgments entered against\nApplicant, totaling over $12,000.  Each judgment arose from delinquent credit card debt,\n3\nand each judgment was entered in 2005. Applicant has done nothing to satisfy any of the\njudgments. \nSubparagraph 1.d alleges a collection account owing in the amount of $157. This\naccount arose from a cell phone bill and has been delinquent since at least 2005. Applicant\nhas done nothing to resolve this account.\nSubparagraph 1.e alleges a medical bill that was submitted for collection in or about\nDecember 2007. Applicant credibly testified this bill should have been covered by medical\ninsurance and that it is now in the process of being paid by the insurance company.\nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.h allege three charged off credit card debts, totaling\nover $14,600. Applicant testified he did not recognize the creditors listed on those accounts\nand, based on similarities in the amounts owing, assumes they are duplicates of the debts\nalleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c. (Tr. 35-38) He did not submit any evidence in\nsupport of those assumptions and admitted he has not even bothered to dispute the\naccounts with the various credit reporting agencies.

He submitted a personal financial\nstatement (AE 1) in which he listed his March 2003 net monthly income as $4,553, net\nmonthly expenses as $6,364, and his net monthly deficit as $1,811. In the same document,\nhe listed his January 2008 net monthly income as $6,178.33, his net monthly expenses as\n$6,433.21, and his net monthly deficit as $254. He does not have a plan to resolve his\ndelinquent debt nor to get his monthly income and expenses in order.    \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case.\n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id. at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant admits he has three outstanding judgments and one outstanding collection\naccount totalling over $12,000. He denies liability for the three charged off credit card\naccounts, totalling over $14,000, based on his assumption that they are duplicates of the\njudgments. He did not offer any evidence in support of those assumptions and has not\ndone anything to dispute the validity of those debts. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a):\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.\nApplicant credibly testified the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e is being resolved\nby his medical insurance company. However, he has done nothing to resolve any of the\nother alleged debts and has no plan to do so in the future. He has allowed each of the\naccounts to remain delinquent for years without taking any action to satisfy any of them.\nHe continues to spend more each month than he earns and hasn\u2019t figured out a way to\nresolve that continuing financial dilemma. I have considered all mitigating conditions and\nfind that none apply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\n\n5\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. He has neither overcome the case against\nhim nor  satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f-h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 9, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an e-\nQIP version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On February 25, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), H (Drug \nInvolvement), and J (Criminal Conduct), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nJune 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 3, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, notarized March 14, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on April 8, 2008, and the \ncase was assigned to me on April 11, 2008. A Notice of Hearing was issued that same \ndate, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on May 8, 2008. During the hearing, \nthree Government exhibits and nine Applicant exhibits were received without objection, \nand Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on May 16, \n2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.c., 2.a. and 2.b., and 3.a. of the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as a \nsoftware engineer 2,1 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He commenced \nworking for his employer in January 2007. He received a Bachelors Degree in Computer \nScience in December 2005.  He never served in the military and never married.  \n \nDuring the period May 2002-September 2007, Applicant was a poly-substance \nabuser whose choice of substances was rather broad, and included narcotics, \nstimulants, hallucinogens, and cannabis.2 He attributed his substance abuse to curiosity \nand, despite learning as a child that drug use could be detrimental to one\u2019s life, he was \ndrawn to \u201cexperiment\u201d with such substances.3 At one point, he intentionally became \n\u201caddicted\u201d to cigarettes for 18 months to experience overcoming an addiction while so \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)/Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86), dated Apr. 9, 2007), at 15; Applicant Exhibit D (Employee Performance \nDevelopment Process, dated Jan. 7, 2008. \n  \n2 Answer to SOR, dated Mar. 14, 2008, at 1. \n \n3 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to Interrogatories, dated Oct. 31, 2007), at 6 is the source for \nthe facts in this paragraph and the next two paragraphs unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nmany individuals were unable to do so.  He noted that there was only one occasion that \nhe ever \u201cabused any drug, whether legal or not, to fill a void in [his] life.\u201d He stressed \nthat \u201cwhile all other substances were kept easily under control and used only for a short \ntime period, . . . marijuana may have gotten away from [him].\u201d \n \nApplicant is not ashamed of his drug use. He believes \u201cit played a non-trivial role \nin [his] development as a person.\u201d He does, however, regret not more seriously \nconsidering his future before satisfying his curiosity, and not being able to leave \nmarijuana alone when he graduated from college. \n \nOn April 9, 2007, Applicant completed his SF 86, and in response to an inquiry \npertaining to his use of illegal drugs and drug activity \u201csince the age of 16 or in the last 7 \nyears, whichever is shorter,\u201d4 Applicant responded, in part, that he had used marijuana \nsocially during college (estimated commencement date May 2002 until estimated end \ndate July 2006) on dozens of occasions, usually while attending parties or other social \ngatherings.5 During an interview with a Government investigator in May 2007, Applicant \nstated he had stopped using illegal drugs in July 2006, and said he had no intention to \nuse any illegal drugs again.6 Nevertheless, despite being aware of the illegal or \ncontrolled status of the substances and the Government\u2019s interest in his substance \nabuse in April 2007, he actually continued to use marijuana on an estimated three \noccasions since graduating from college, including one time during the last week of \nSeptember 2007.7  Applicant contended he did not lie to the investigator because at the \ntime he made the statement, that was his intention.8 \n \nOn October 31, 2007, Applicant stated that graduating from college in December \n2005 was his personal signal to cease his substance abuse.  Nevertheless, as noted \nabove, he continued using marijuana several more times after graduation. He stated:  \u201cI \nfeel guilty about it.  It is no longer fun, it keeps me from \u2018being all that I can be.\u2019  And \nmore importantly it is illegal & could cost me my job.\u201d9 He also contended he decided to \nstop using marijuana because he was \u201cgrowing up\u201d and recognized \u201cnothing positive \ncomes from it. . . .\u201d10 He stated he has no intention to use any of the substances \nagain.11 \n \n4 Question 24. \n \n5 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 31. \n \n6 Tr. at 32-34.

He usually will invite [Applicant] over to hang out [sic] and smoke \nif he has some.\u201d24 \n \nApplicant has never received any counseling from a recognized drug \nrehabilitation program nor has he ever attended any drug rehabilitation support group \nactivity for his substance abuse.25 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n17 Id. at 42-43. \n \n18 Id. at 45-46. \n \n19 Tr. at 46. \n \n20 Applicant Exhibit D, supra note 1, at 4. \n \n21 Applicant Exhibit E (Certificates of Commendation, undated). \n \n22 Applicant Exhibit A (Character Reference Letters, various dates). \n \n23 Applicant Exhibit B (Move-Out Notice, dated Oct. 28, 2007). \n \n24 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 3, at 1. \n \n25 Id. at 2-3. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d26 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \n \n26 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of \n1970, \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition),\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d may \nraise security concerns. During the period May 2002-September 2007, Applicant \npurchased, used, and sold a variety of illegal or controlled substances, or misused \nprescription drugs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply.   \n  \nAG & 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d would \napply if Applicant had already been granted a security clearance.  However, in this \ninstance, Applicant was merely an applicant for a security and it had not been granted \nprior to his continued substance abuse.  Accordingly, the evidence fails to establish AG \n& 25(g). \nIn addition, AG & 25(h), \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure \nto clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use,\u201d may raise security \nconcerns.  While there is no expressed intent by Applicant to continue his illegal drug \nuse, in May 2007, he stated to an investigator that he had stopped using illegal drugs in \nJuly 2006, and said he had no intention to use any illegal drugs again.  Nevertheless, he \nactually continued to use marijuana on an estimated three occasions since graduating \nfrom college, including one time during the last week of September 2007.  Thus, his lack \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nof candor, as recently as May 2007, has raised substantial question as to his \ncommitment to discontinue drug use.  AG & 25(h) applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  While the majority \nof Applicant\u2019s illegal substance abuse occurred during the period May 2002 until \nJanuary 2004, he continued his \u201cexperimentation\u201d with cocaine until October 2005 and \nhis extensive use of marijuana until September 2007. Taken individually, the \n\u201cexperimentation\u201d of some of the substances might qualify as infrequent use that \noccurred \u201cso long ago.\u201d However, the entire course of conduct-the behavior-which, \ndespite having been pronounced by Applicant as in the past, continued for nine months \nafter he became an employee of the defense contractor and to within six months of the \nissuance of the SOR, casting doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  The evidence fails to establish AG & 26(a). \n \nUnder AG & 26(b), drug involvement concerns may also be mitigated where \nthere is a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence \nAs noted above, on October 28, 2007, Applicant and his roommate agreed to \ncease sharing an apartment. That action was the first formal disassociation from his \ndrug-using associate. Also, his claims that his lifestyle and environment have changed, \nthat he has graduated from college, has taken up physical fitness, and is now employed \nin a professional capacity, when viewed carefully, reveal some rehabilitative steps. \nApplicant graduated from college in December 2005, took up physical fitness, and \nentered the professional work place in November 2005 (with a non-defense contractor \nas a software engineer) and then in January 2007 with a defense contractor. \nRegardless of the changes in environment and lifestyle, Applicant continued his \nsubstance abuse. His purported abstinence, commencing in September 2007, after \nnearly five and one-half years of intensive substance abuse with a wide variety of \nsubstances, has, if he is to be believed, been in place less than nine months, hardly a \nsufficient period of abstinence, considering his history of substance abuse and the \nabsence of any drug awareness or treatment programs. The evidence fails to fully \nestablish AG \u00b6 26(b).  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 30:      \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying.  Similarly, under AG & 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted,\u201d may raise security concerns. During the period May 2002-September 2007, \nApplicant purchased, possessed, and sold a variety of illegal or controlled substances, \nor unauthorized prescription drugs.  Those activities constitute criminal conduct \nbecause such conduct violates state and/or federal criminal laws. AG && 31(a) and \n31(c) apply.   \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d Also, AG \u00b6 32(d) may apply where \u201cthere is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s nearly five \nand one-half years of criminal conduct-intensive substance abuse with a wide variety of \nsubstances-continued until at least September 2007, or until about nine months ago. \nThose nine months of purported abstinence, as well as some expressed remorse, and a \ngood employment record, constitute some evidence of rehabilitation. However, the \nlength of the criminal conduct, the absence of being truly and sincerely remorseful-he \nsaid he was not ashamed-about his drug abuse, the fact that the criminal conduct \ncontinued after he became employed by a defense contractor, and it continued after he \nmisrepresented facts to an investigator, all minimize the significance of the possible \nmitigating conditions and cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  The evidence fails to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d).   \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, and \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG & 16(b), \u201cdeliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative,\u201d may raise security concerns. \nIn April 2007, Applicant completed his SF 86, and indicated he had used a \nvariety of illegal or controlled substances, or misused prescription drugs usually while \nattending parties or other social gatherings. During an interview with a Government \ninvestigator in May 2007, Applicant stated he had stopped using illegal drugs in July \n2006, and said he had no intention to use any illegal drugs again. Nevertheless, despite \nbeing aware of the illegal or controlled status of the substances, he actually continued to \nuse marijuana on an estimated three more occasions after graduating from college, \nincluding one time during the last week of September 2007.  Applicant contended he did \nnot lie to the investigator because at the time he made the statement, his intention was \nnot to use illegal substances in the future.  While there is evidence that substance \nabuse continued until September 2007, the record is bereft that the substance abuse \ncontinued between July 2006 and May 2007.  With Applicant\u2019s denial, and the absence \nof Government evidence to the contrary, there is no evidence Applicant deliberately \nomitted, concealed, or falsified information in the SF 86 or during the interview.  The \nevidence fails to establish AG & 16(a) or AG & 16(b). \nIn addition, AG & 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative \nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information,\u201d may raise security \nconcerns.  In this instance, Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and criminal conduct were \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nclearly sufficient for an adverse determination, and the two minor allegations under \nGuideline E offered no meaningful evidence not otherwise considered. Drug use while \nholding a security clearance is specifically dealt with under AG & 25(g), and drug use \nwhile a clearance is pending may be considered under the whole person concept. The \nevidence fails to establish AG & 16(c). \nIn addition, AG \u00b6 16(g), \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity,\u201d \nmay raise security concerns.  Applicant, his roommate, and his drug supplier, as well as \nthe friends and associates at college who used illegal substances with him during social \ngatherings and thereafter, were all involved in criminal activity.  It appears Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with everyone other than his roommate ceased upon graduation.  He and \nhis roommate continued to reside together until October 2007. Because of that \ncontinuing relationship, AG & 16(g) applies.   \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 17(e), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d and under AG \u00b6 17(g), it may be \nmitigated when an \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d  \nApplicant terminated his relationship with his roommate in October 2007, and has taken \npositive steps to reduce vulnerability by becoming more forthright regarding his history \nof illegal substance abuse and criminal conduct.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(e) and 17(g) apply.   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When Applicant\u2019s problems first \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nbegan, he was a university student.  Curiosity got the best of him and, knowing what he \nwas about to do was illegal, he intentionally began to experiment with a number of \nillegal or controlled substances, or misused prescription drugs. (See AG & 2(a)(1), AG & \n2(a)(2), AG & 2(a)(4), AG & 2(a)(5), and AG & 2(a)(7).)  His drug abuse reached its \nhighest level in 2003 when he abused nine different substances.  Thereafter, while it \nmay have tapered off, he continued to abuse cocaine as recently as October 2005, and \nmarijuana as recently as September 2007. (See AG & 2(a)(3).  He intended to abstain \nin July 2006, and intended to alter his lifestyle and environment, but, notwithstanding his \ngraduation from college, his interest in physical fitness, and his employment by a \ndefense contractor, his substance abuse continued.  After nearly five and one-half years \nof intensive substance abuse, followed by only nine months of abstinence, his \nbehavioral changes and rehabilitation efforts are too recent to fully assess, and there is \ninsufficient evidence of change to conclude there is no likelihood of recurrence.   (See \nAG & 2(a)(6) and AG & 2(a)(9).) \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and criminal conduct considerations.  His personal conduct concerns are \nbetter covered under the other two issue areas which specifically are directed towards \nhis criminal conduct and drug involvement, and are considered redundant to them. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(1): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(2): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a.(3): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(4): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(5): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(6): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a.(7): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(8): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(9): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(10): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.(1): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.(2): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.(3): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.(4): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 52-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor and has held a security clearance since 1991. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He and his wife were married in March 1984, divorced in June 1992, and re-married in August 1994. They have two sons, ages 23 and 21. (FORM, Items 5 and 6) Applicant considers himself to be a social drinker. He will drink beer when attending or watching a sporting event, and on such occasions has consumed as many as 10 beers. He drinks between three and six beers at one time each month and was last intoxicated in March 2008. (FORM, Item 7) Applicant has further stated he will continue to consume alcohol in this manner and with this frequency.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s\ninformation about his alcohol consumption. Accordingly, his request for a security\nclearance is denied.\nOn November 20, 2006, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive\nPositions (SF-86) to request a security clearance required as part of his employment\nwith a defense contractor. (FORM, Item 5) After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn May 27, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive\nOctober 31, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included six documents (Items 1 - 6) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nunder Guideline G (alcohol consumption) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2\nMore specifically, the government alleged that Applicant was arrested in September\n2006, charged with and convicted of Operating a Motor Vehicle While Intoxicated (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a); that from 1975 until at least March 2008, he regularly consumed alcohol to\nexcess and to the point of intoxication (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he intends to continue\nconsuming alcohol to the point of intoxication (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that he was arrested in\nSeptember 1995, charged with and convicted of Operating a Motor Vehicle While\nIntoxicated/Operating a Motor Vehicle With a Blood Alcohol Content 0.08% - 0.15%.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nOn June 22, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, admitted the allegations in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c and 1d. He denied the SOR \u00b6 1.b allegation. He also requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On July 24, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of\nrelevant materials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision.\n3\nApplicant received the FORM on August 6, 2008, and was given 30 days to file a\nresponse to the FORM. He did not submit anything in response to the FORM by the\nSeptember 5, 2008, deadline. The case was assigned to me on October 10, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor and has\nheld a security clearance since 1991. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s\ndegree in electrical engineering. He and his wife were married in March 1984, divorced\nin June 1992, and re-married in August 1994. They have two sons, ages 23 and 21.\n(FORM, Items 5 and 6)\nApplicant considers himself to be a social drinker. He will drink beer when\nattending or watching a sporting event, and on such occasions has consumed as many\nas 10 beers. He drinks between three and six beers at one time each month and was\nlast intoxicated in March 2008. (FORM, Item 7) Applicant has further stated he will\ncontinue to consume alcohol in this manner and with this frequency. He also\nacknowledges that his alcohol consumption will probably result in his being legally\nintoxicated at times. Applicant further avers he will not drive after drinking to the point of\nintoxication, which he speculates is about four beers. (FORM, Item 7)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nPrior to the current investigation, Applicant had submitted a Security Clearance\nApplication (SF 86) on March 7, 2000 (FORM, Item 6), to request a periodic\nreinvestigation. He disclosed therein that, in September 1995, he was arrested for\n\u201cDUI\u201d. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 60 days in jail, of which all but\ntwo days (already served) were suspended. He was also placed on probation for 363\ndays and assessed fines and court costs. (FORM, Items 4, 5, 6 and 9) There is no\ninformation available regarding the details of his conduct, e.g., how much he had to\ndrink or under what circumstances he was drinking and decided to drive. Further, the\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d states the charge as \u201cOperating a Motor Vehicle While\nIntoxicated/Operating a Motor Vehicle with a Blood Alcohol Content 0.08% - 0.15%.\u201d\nHowever, the record before me does not contain the source of that charge as drafted.\nNonetheless, it is uncontroverted that Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of\nan alcohol-related driving offense in 1995.\nIn September 2006, after watching a basketball game and consuming an\nunspecified amount of alcohol, Applicant was arrested and charged Operating a Vehicle\nWhile Intoxicated. After refusing a breath test, his blood alcohol level was determined\nthrough an involuntary blood test conducted pursuant to a search warrant. He was\nconvicted in December 2006 and sentenced to 365 days in jail. His jail term was\nsuspended for one year conditioned on good and lawful behavior, payment of assessed\nfines and court costs, completion of alcohol safety awareness classes, 180 hours of\ncommunity service, participation in Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) activities,\nand installation of an ignition interlock system on his car for one year. Applicant\ncompleted the court\u2019s requirements and was released from probation in December\n2007. (FORM, Item 8)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline G (alcohol consumption) at AG \u00b6 21.\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nAlcohol Consumption.\nUnder Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise\nof questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) The government\u2019s\ninformation presented in the FORM is sufficient to support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\n- 1.d. Applicant was arrested and convicted in 1995 and in 2006 for driving while under\nthe influence of alcohol. In December 2007, Appellant completed probation and other\nrequirements of his sentence from his 2006 conviction. He admits to consuming as\nmany as 10 beers in one sitting and that he drinks between three and six beers in one\nsitting about once monthly. Applicant was most recently intoxicated in March 2008,\nthree months after completing his probation and having the interlock ignition device\nremoved from his car. \nAvailable information requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at\nAG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under  the\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n5\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent) and AG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).\nBy contrast, of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 23, only AG \u00b6 23(a)(so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;) potentially applies\nhere. Applicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related incident occurred about two years ago. It\nhad been 11 years since any similar conduct. Thus, it could be argued Applicant\u2019s\nconduct was not recent and was infrequent. However, it does not appear Applicant has\nchanged his drinking habits, even after a second alcohol-related arrest, a year of\nprobation, violation of which would have landed him in jail for a year, a year of court-\nordered monitoring (through the ignition interlock device) of his drinking and driving, and\nafter alcohol awareness classes and work with MADD. Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol ranges\nfrom mildly excessive (three to six beers at once) to abusive (10 beers at once), with no\napparent change in sight. In light of all of the information presented, I cannot conclude\nhe will not again drink and drive or that his alcohol consumption does not cast doubt on\nhis \u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the security concerns presented by the adverse information about his alcohol\nconsumption.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline H. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 52 years old and\npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult. Indeed, he is a father and husband with\nadvanced degrees, he has a stable employment record, and he has held a security\nclearance for about 19 years. However, in response to the government\u2019s concerns\nabout his drinking and alcohol-related arrests, he exhibits an unwillingness to change or\nto even acknowledge the gravity of the information presented. Absent information that\nshows he is not likely to engage in alcohol abuse or illegal alcohol-related conduct, the\nfavorable information in his background is insufficient to overcome the security concerns\nabout his drinking. A fair and commonsense assessment  of the available information\n8\nbearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has not yet satisfied\nthe doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.9\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto allow Applicant access to classified information.

On March 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 13, 2008.

DOHA received the request in March 2008. Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on April 11, 2008, and I received the case assignment on April\n16, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 9, 2008, which Applicant\nacknowledged receiving more than 15 days before the hearing.  I convened the hearing\n1\nas scheduled on June 5, 2008. The government offered two exhibits (GE) 1 and 2,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf. She submitted 12 exhibits (AE) A through L, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on June 16, 2008. The record closed on June 5, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (the PRC). (Tr. 12-14) The\nrequest and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included\nin the record as Administrative Exhibits I to VI. The facts administratively noticed are set\nout in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 18, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the security\nconcern set forth in \u00b6 1 of the SOR.\nApplicant, who is 45 years old, works as an engineer and lead architect for a\ndefense contractor. She began working for her current employer in 1997. At its request,\nshe completed and submitted a security clearance application in March 2007.  \n2\nApplicant and her husband were born in the PRC. She received a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree and a master\u2019s degree in science from major universities in the PRC. She met\nher husband while in graduate school. They married in 1987 in China. Her husband\nmoved to the United States shortly thereafter to begin work on his doctorate degree.\nApplicant came to the U..S. in March 1989 to start work on her doctorate degree. Both\nreceived their doctorate degrees from an American university. An American university\nawarded Applicant a Masters in Business Administration in 2002. She and her husband\nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens in February 2000 and hold U.S. passports. Applicant\u2019s\nhusband is a tenured professor at an American university.

She\nvalues these assets at approximately $2.5 million. She and her husband also have\nretirement investment accounts valued at nearly $800,000. Their combined yearly\nincome is approximately $250,000. Their children attend U.S. schools and are active in\nsports and other programs after school. They have no economic interests in the PRC.4\nApplicant\u2019s 81-year-old mother lives in the PRC. She owns her own residence\nand lives alone. She worked in the local government owned-factory and receives a\npension from the government. For the last three or four years, Applicant has sent her\nmother $1,000 once a year as a gift. She does not provide regular financial support for\nher mother. Her mother has never visited the U.S. She talks with her mother by\ntelephone about once a month.5\nApplicant\u2019s two older brothers and older half-sister are citizens of and reside in\nthe PRC. Her half-sister is about 19 years older than she. Her sister left home for\ncollege when Applicant was a baby. Her sister is married and has two grown daughters\nwho are married.  Her sister retired from her job as a site manager of a train station. Her\nsister\u2019s husband is also retired. She assumes they are getting a retirement benefit, but\nshe has no information about this benefit. She may talk with her half-sister once a year.\nHer half-sister has not visited her in the U.S. 6\nOne brother works at a local hospital where he is in charge of hospital supplies.\nHer other brother works in product distribution at the local steel company. Both brothers\nare married and their wives do not work outside of the home. One brother has two\nchildren and the other brother has one child. These children are adults. She talks by\ntelephone with her brothers about twice a year, on holidays. Neither brother has visited\nher in the U.S.7\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of and reside in the PRC\nin a distant area from her family. They own a business. Her husband\u2019s four siblings own\nbusinesses. She has limited contact with her in-laws. Her husband talks with his parents\nby telephone every other month. Her husband\u2019s parents visited the U.S. after\nApplicant\u2019s son was born, but have not returned as they don\u2019t speak English. She has\nhad little contact with his parents and siblings since her marriage more than 20 years\nago. Her husband does not send any financial support to his parents or any of his\nsiblings.8\n\nId. at 37-39, 72-73.\n9\nId. at 39-40, 72-74, 78-79.\n10\nAE H (2007 e-mails to employer about trip to the PRC); Tr. 40-41, 73, 75, 78.\n11\nAE A at 2, 4-6; Tr. 29-31, 45-48, 94. \n12\n4\nSince January 1, 2000, Applicant has traveled to the PRC three times. In\nDecember 2000, she traveled alone and on her U.S. passport to the PRC to visit her\nailing father. She stayed with her parents for the entire two weeks of her visit. Her\nbrothers visited her, but not her half-sister. Her father died in 2003.9\nApplicant did not return to the PRC for her father\u2019s funeral. Rather, in 2004, she\nand her family traveled to the PRC. They stayed one week with her mother, then spent\na week sightseeing in Beijing. Applicant returned to the U.S. while her husband and\nchildren visited with his parents for a week. During this trip, Applicant visited with her\nbrothers when they came to their mother\u2019s home.10\nApplicant\u2019s last trip to the PRC occurred in 2007. Before she made her\nreservations, she notified her employer of her intent to travel to the PRC and inquired if\nthere would be a problem. Her employer told her there would be no problem with her\ntaking this trip. She traveled alone to the PRC to celebrate her mother\u2019s 80  birthday.\nth\nShe visited with her brothers and her half-sister during this one week trip. Applicant\nalways traveled on her U.S. passport. Her husband and children traveled on their U.S.\npassports. During her trips to the PRC, Applicant did not contact friends or others\noutside of her family. She has no future plans to travel to the PRC.11\nApplicant states that following the Tiananmen Square occurrence, she began\nthinking about her new life in the U.S. She has embraced the freedoms of speech and\nreligion. She realized she would be able to prosper economically and develop a career\nin the U.S. in a way she would not be able to do in the PRC. She made a decision to\nremain in this country. She explained the basis for her belief that the government of the\nPRC would not likely harm members of her family to force her to divulge classified\ninformation. She does not believe that her mother would tell her if the government of\nPRC was placing pressure on her. If the government of the PRC would try to pressure\nher mother, she would tell the world about the PRC\u2019s actions because she believes that\nby speaking out in public the PRC government would be very concerned about losing\nface and would free her family faster. She could not be pressured because of her family\nin the PRC.12\nFour colleagues, two managers and a professor from her doctorate program\nwrote recommendations on behalf of Applicant. All uniformly agree that she is highly\nintelligent, hardworking, reliable, trustworthy, and excels at her job. In the performance\nof her duties, she works with intellectual property materials and appropriately handles\nthis sensitive information. She is conscientious about the need to protect sensitive\ninformation of contractors and her employer. All praise her character and integrity, and\n\nAE B (letter, dated May 23, 2008); AE C (Letter, undated); AE D (Letter, dated May 12, 2008); AE E (Letter,\n13\ndated May 10, 2008); AE F (Letter, dated May 29, 2008); AE G(Letter, dated June 2, 2008); AE J\n(Performance evaluation 2007).\n5\nrecommend her for a security clearance. Her most recent performance evaluation\npraises her skills and work contribution.13\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The PRC is an authoritarian,\ncommunist party-led state. Human rights violations continue to be problematic.\nConcerns regarding the PRC\u2019s weapons development, theft of classified technology\ninformation between 1979 and 1999, and industrial espionage activities remain. The\nPRC continues to have active intelligence operations in the U.S., which seek to obtain\nmilitary and industrial secrets through Americans of Chinese ancestry. On the other\nhand, the PRC supports the U.S.\u2019s anti-terrorism position and activities. The U.S. and\nthe PRC have developed joint trade agreements, resulting in the sale of goods to each\nother, and work together on environmental issues. The PCR enjoys a most favored\nnation status in trading with the U.S. The PRC has opened its doors to outside\ninvestment.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n6\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n\n7\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers and half-sister are citizens of and reside in the\nPRC. She maintains a normal familial relationship with her mother and two brothers and\nsome contact with her half-sister. Her husband maintains a normal familial relationship\nwith his parents and siblings in the PRC. These relationships are not per se a reason to\ndeny Applicant a security clearance. The government must establish that these family\nrelationships create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion or would create a potential conflict of interest between her\nobligations to protect sensitive information and her desire to help her family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the government of the\nPRC. See ISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). Concerning the\nintelligence gathering activities of the PRC, in ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May\n9, 2008) the Appeal Board agreed with the government\u2019s argument, concluding that\nsubstantial evidence of a security risk existsand when an Applicant has family members\nliving in the PRC because the PRC is an active collector of intelligence and sensitive\nproprietary information from U.S. defense contractors, considers U.S. citizens of\nChinese ancestry to be \u201cprime intelligence targets\u201d, and monitors its citizens\u2019 telephone,\nfax and e-mail communications. This risk that an Applicant could be targeted for\nmanipulation or induced into compromising classified information is real, not theoretical.\nApplicant\u2019s relationship and her contacts with her family in the PRC raise a heightened\nrisk that the government of the PRC will use her family members to pressure her into\nrevealing classified information. The same risk exists in regards to Applicant\u2019s husband\nbecause he maintains contacts with his parents and siblings in the PRC. The\ngovernment has established its case under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).\nIn deciding if Applicant has submitted evidence of mitigation, under AG \u00b6 8 (a), I\nmust consider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\n\n8\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider if\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with her family members is not a basis to deny\nher a security clearance; however, her burden of proof on mitigation requires more than\nstatements about the limited scope of her conversations and contacts with family\nmembers. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). Applicant\u2019s mother is\nretired and depends upon the government of the PRC to provide her retirement benefit.\nApplicant traveled to the PRC three times in the last eight years to visit her family\nmembers, in particular her parents. See continues to speak with her mother and\nbrothers on a regular basis. In light of the intelligence activities of the PRC directed to\nthe U.S. through Americans of Chinese ancestry, Applicant has not mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) and (b).\n \nFinally, under AG \u00b6 8(c), I must consider if the \u201ccontact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s contacts with her mother\nand two brothers are not infrequent and casual, nor are her husband\u2019s contacts with his\nfamily infrequent and casual. I, however, find that Applicant\u2019s relationship with her much\nolder half-sister is casual and infrequent, given the almost 19 year difference in age and\nthe minimal efforts she makes to communicate with her half-sister from the U.S. or\nwhen she was visiting the PRC.\nNone of the remaining mitigating conditions are applicable in this case. Applicant\nhas not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6 6.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n9\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant came to the U.S. 20 years\nago as a student. Following the incident in Tiananmen Square in 1989, she considered\nwhat her life might be in the U.S. as opposed to her life in the PRC. She eventually\ndecided to remain in the U.S. She has embraced the concepts associated with\ndemocracy and freedom. She and her husband became U.S. citizens. They are living\nthe American dream. They have a good income, are saving for their retirement, and\nraising their children in the American way of life. They abide by the laws and manage\ntheir finances. They are highly respected individuals in their professions and careers.\nApplicant\u2019s managers and co-workers praise her worth ethic and character. She is\nreliable and trustworthy. The Appeal Board has held that all these highly admirable\nqualities are not enough to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns when an\nApplicant has family in the PRC. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008).\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under the foreign influence\nguideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn January 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 28, 2008, and requested an\nadministrative determination. On February 21, 2008, the government prepared a File of\nRelevant Materials (FORM). Applicant replied on March 24, 2008. Department counsel\ndid not object to the admission of the reply, and the case was assigned to me on May\n12, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nMay 29, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is a 53-year-\nold married woman with three children, ages 30, 19, and 15. The oldest two children are\nfrom previous marriages. She served two stints in the U.S. Navy. The first was from\n1974 through 1978 and the second was from 1982 through 1990. On both occasions\nshe was honorably discharged. She served in the National Guard from 1993 to 1997. \nApplicant works for a defense contractor as a flightline technician. She is highly\nrespected on the job. A coworker describes her as \u201can extremely hard worker willing to\ngo the extra mile to complete her tasking\u201d (Reference letter of March 4, 2008, as\nincluded in the Reply).\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. They began when her then\nhusband left her in approximately 1988 when she was pregnant. Over the next two\nyears, she unsuccessfully struggled to manage her bills and support her family. In 1990,\nshe filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Item 7). She scheduled approximately $14,700 of\ndebt which was discharged through this process. \nAt some time during the early 1990s, Applicant started a business. The record\ncontains no description of it. It failed after a major hurricane devastated the local\neconomy. At the time, Applicant and her family lived at her father-in-law\u2019s home on a\nmilitary base. When he passed away, they had to move. For the next several years,\nApplicant struggled to locate affordable housing, in part, because apartment rental costs\nskyrocketed after the hurricane (Answer). Her finances again grew delinquent. \nIn 1999, Applicant again filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Item 6). Approximately\n$51,000 of scheduled, unsecured debt was discharged.\nSince the 1999 bankruptcy, Applicant has again experienced financial problems.\nCurrently, her delinquent debt totals approximately $21,700. It includes phone bills,\nutilities, medical expenses, credit card accounts, and income tax bills.\nThrough the help of a law firm, Applicant has consolidated nearly all of her\ndelinquencies and organized a payment plan. Through the plan, approximately $257\nmonthly is applied to the delinquencies. She is researching any of her delinquencies not\nincluded in the plan, and adding them to it after she verifies them. There is no record of\nwhen Applicant entered the plan, or when the delinquencies will be satisfied.\nApplicant also contends she is satisfying some of her delinquencies through\npayment plans she arranged independently of the one she organized with the law firm\u2019s\nhelp. She provided no documentation of these efforts.\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Here, Applicant\u2019s 20-year history of\nfinancial problems triggers the application of AG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6\n19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other\nfinancial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems experienced through approximately 2000 were\ncaused primarily by a failed marriage, a failed business, and an economic downturn that\noccurred in her community after a natural disaster. However, these financial problems\nrecurred, and no such potentially mitigating factors appear to have contributed to the\nrecurrence. Also, the resulting financial delinquencies are still largely outstanding.\nNeither AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d nor AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has organized a payment plan, and has begun making payments.\nAlthough she retained a law firm to help organize her debts, she did not establish\nwhether it is providing her with any counseling services. Moreover, she provided no\ndocumentation of her repayment history, nor did she establish when she began\nexecuting the plan, or when the plan would be complete. AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d\napplies, but AG \u00b6 20(c ), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d does not.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n5\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe negative security inference generated by Applicant\u2019s two bankruptcy\ndischarges is offset somewhat by the circumstances that generated the underlying\nfinancial conditions. However, Applicant\u2019s financial problems recurred after the second\ndischarge, and no such mitigating circumstances contributed to the recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s steps at debt resolution constitute good-faith efforts to resolve her financial\nproblems. She failed, however, to provide corroborating documentary evidence of these\nefforts. Consequently, these good-faith efforts are outweighed by the longstanding\ndelinquent debt history and its recurrent nature. Evaluating this case using the whole\nperson factors, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated herein.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 64-year-old who has worked for a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2005, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged two medical debts and two tax liens totaling $16,678. \nApplicant asserted he is making $25 per month payments on one medical debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). (Item 6) He provided documentation showing he made a $25 payment in \nDecember 2007 and a second in January 2008. The debt was $340 when he answered \nthe SOR. (Item 4) Applicant asserted he is making similar payments on the medical \ndebt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He provided documentation showing two payments, the last \noccurring in January 2008. As of his response to the SOR, he had reduced the debt to \n$5,807. (Item 4) This debt was incurred in 2004 when Applicant was unemployed and \nbecame ill resulting in hospitalization. There is no documentation Applicant has made \nadditional payments on any of his debts. \n \nAccompanying his answer to the SOR (Item 4), Applicant provided \ndocumentation that he had paid other medical debts not listed in the SOR. As of \nFebruary 2008, Applicant\u2019s monthly discretionary income (gross income less monthly \nexpenses) was $2,000. (Item 6) \n \n \nApplicant admits owing the IRS $9,650 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and the state department of \nrevenue $806 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In September 2000, the IRS issued a tax lien (Item 7) and in \nAugust 1999, the state issued a tax lien. (Item 7) In August 2006, Applicant completed \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Item 5) He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to section 27, which asked if during the previous seven years he had a \nlien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts. Applicant asserts \nhe \u201cwas unaware of any tax liens appearing on [his] credit record\u201d (Item 4) when he \ncompleted his e-QIP. He assets he did not intentionally provide false information.  \n \nIn his response to the SOR (Item 4), Applicant stated he would investigate the \ntax liens and arrange repayment of the debts. In February 2008, Applicant responded to \nwritten interrogatories (Item 6). At that time, Applicant stated he had talked with an IRS \n\n \n \n \n3\nagent and was told the IRS records did not show the lien. The agent stated liens do not \nappear after 15 years. Applicant asserts the agent stated he would provide Applicant \nwith forms to apply for a manual release of the lien. No documentation supporting his \nassertions was received. \n \nThe tax liens were filed in 1999 (Item 7) less than ten years before Applicant \ntalked with the IRS and seven years before Applicant completed his e-QIP.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n \n \n \n4\n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $16,800 on four past due obligations including \ntwo tax liens. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his \ninterview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR \nresponse, and his response to interrogatories. Throughout this process, he had \nadmitted responsibility for four delinquent debs, totaling more than $16,000. These \ndebts are currently delinquent. He has provided insufficient documentation to show \nsignificant progress resolving these debts. He documented making four payments \ntotaling $100. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19 (c). \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s one medical debt occurred when he was sick and \nhospitalized in 2004, while unemployed. Illness is not an event that is unlikely to recur. \nThere is no showing the tax liens were not caused by sickness. The debts remain \nunpaid. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experience illness and hospitalization while \nunemployed. His illness occurred four years ago. AG & 20(b) has some applicability.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(c), there is no showing Applicant has attended financial classes, \nmaintains a budget, or is paying his debts. AG & 20(c) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(d), Applicant asserts he is making monthly payments on two \ndebts, but only documented making four $25 payments in December 2006 and January \n2007. No other payments are shown. Evidence of a good-faith plan is lacking. Applicant \nasserts he owes no past due taxes. However, he again failed to provide supporting \ndocuments. He talked with the IRS, but provided no evidence he discussed the state tax \nlien with state authorities. Tax liens may not appear after 15 years, but Applicant\u2019s lien \nis only nine years old. He has failed to show the tax liens have been released or that no \ntax is owed. AG & 20(d) does not apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \n \nUnder AG &16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d and AG &16(b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d \n \n \nApplicant=s false answer on his SF 86 about his tax liens tends to show \nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and lack of trustworthiness. AG &16(a) and AG \n&16(b) apply. \n \n \nApplicant asserts he was unaware of any tax liens and did not intentionally \nprovide false information. Tax liens are routinely imposed only after a person is notified \nof the tax obligations and provided an opportunity to respond. Additionally, Applicant \nknew he was delinquent on almost $6,000 of medical debt resulting from his 2004 \nillness and hospitalization. He failed to report his delinquent medical debt on his e-QIP \ndoes not strengthen his claim of mistake. Due to the significant nature of the debt he \nshould have been aware of the debts when completing his e-QIP. \n \n \nBecause Applicant chose to have his security clearance eligibility addressed \nwithout a hearing, I am unable to give additional weight to his credibility. Applicant failed \nto present a good explanation as to why he did not answer the questions correctly.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. Mitigation could occur under AG \u00b6 17(a) if a person \u201cprovides the individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d Applicant has not met his burden of proving that \nhe made good-faith efforts to correct the omissions in his security clearance application \nor that his efforts were prompt. I find this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) provides mitigation where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The security clearance application in issue \n\n \n \n \n7\nwas executed in August 2006, which is recent. I conclude this potentially mitigating \ncondition does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 (f) provides mitigation where \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or \nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d Applicant=s tax liens are substantiated by his \nadmissions and Item 7. Also, the information was pertinent to a determination of his \ndebts and finances. I find this mitigating factor does not apply. I also considered \ncarefully the other potentially mitigating conditions and conclude they do not apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. His medical debts are not the type of \ndebt that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. However, Applicant did not explain how or why the tax liens were \nincurred. Applicant asserts he was unaware of his tax liens and did not falsify his \nquestionnaire. Outstanding tax liens are a type of obligations an applicant is expected to \nremember and report on his e-QIP.  \n \nApplicant has $2,000 per month in discretionary income, but has shown payment \nof only $100 on his debts. Paying $100 on his outstanding obligations is insufficient to \nshow rehabilitation, a permanent change of behavior, or the likelihood the debts will not \ncontinue. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes eight delinquent debts totaling $22,056 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h). Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, and denied the other debts. She indicated she had no knowledge of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, had started making payments on those debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f, and had paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h in full. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old human resource specialist (\u201cpersonal assistant IV lead\u201d), who has been employed by her present employer, a defense contractor, since November 2006. She is seeking a secret security clearance for her duties as lead of a 20-person team servicing a warrior transition unit (Item 3, Item 4, Ex. A). Applicant graduated from high school in June 1993. She attended a local community college during the fall semester of 1993. The record available for review does not indicate whether Applicant held a job until February 1997, when she began working as a legal secretary. In February 2005, she switched legal employers, but stayed there only until that August 2005. In September 2005, she began working in the defense industry, taking a job as a material expeditor for a defense contractor on a military installation.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 23, 2007. On February 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its action to deny her a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued as of  September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 10, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 28, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. On\nApril 30, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting\nof seven exhibits (Items 1-7). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and\nAugust 13, 2008\n\nThe e-QIP submitted as Item 3 does not contain the signature form, but it indicates that Applicant certified\n1\nthe accuracy of the information on May 23, 2007. The government also submitted as Item 4 a Questionnaire\nfor Sensitive Positions (SF 86) dated June 26, 2007, which was apparently prepared from the information\nprovided on the May 23, 2007, e-QIP. E-QIP release forms signed by Applicant on May 24, 2007, are\nappended to the June 2007 SF 86 (Item 4).\n2\ninstructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant filed a response (Exhibit A)\non May 15, 2008, to which the government did not object. On June 9, 2008, the case\nwas assigned to another DOHA administrative judge to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. The case assignment was transferred to me on June 27, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations\n(Item 2) and her response to the FORM (Ex. A), eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\neight delinquent debts totaling $22,056 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h). Applicant admitted\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, and denied the other debts. She indicated she\nhad no knowledge of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, had started making payments on those\ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f, and had paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h in full. After\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old human resource specialist (\u201cpersonal assistant IV\nlead\u201d), who has been employed by her present employer, a defense contractor, since\nNovember 2006. She is seeking a secret security clearance for her duties as lead of a\n20-person team servicing a warrior transition unit (Item 3, Item 4, Ex. A).\nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1993. She attended a local\ncommunity college during the fall semester of 1993. The record available for review\ndoes not indicate whether Applicant held a job until February 1997, when she began\nworking as a legal secretary. In February 2005, she switched legal employers, but\nstayed there only until that August 2005. In September 2005, she began working in the\ndefense industry, taking a job as a material expeditor for a defense contractor on a\nmilitary installation. Once that company\u2019s contract ended, she continued on with the\nnew contract holder in November 2006 (Item 3, Item 4, Ex. A).\nIn July 2005, Applicant\u2019s spouse (then fianc\u00e9) broke his right femur in a\nmotorcycle accident. He subsequently suffered medical complications that left him\nunable to work for about three months. Applicant was financially responsible for paying\ntheir expenses, and payment of some credit cards and her student loans was not a\npriority (Ex. A).\nIn request for a secret security clearance, Applicant completed an e-QIP on May\n23, 2007.  Applicant responded affirmatively to delinquent debt inquiries under section\n1\n\nAs of February 2008 (Item 5), Equifax was reporting that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g had transferred or sold\n2\nthe debt. It is obvious from the account numbers listed and the high credit amounts  that the creditor in SOR\n\u00b6 1.b is actively pursuing collection of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. As conceded by the government in the FORM,\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is an updated balance of SOR \u00b6 1.g and does not represent additional debt.\n3\n28, \u201ca. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nand \u201cb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and indicated that\nshe owed about $10,000 in credit card debt to four named creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,2\n1.f and 1.h). She added in explanation that the accounts were delinquent because her\nfianc\u00e9 had been out of work for three months following an accident, and she had helped\nhim \u201cget back on his feet.\u201d (Item 3, Item 4). In a section provided for additional\ncomment, Applicant stated:\nAs I stated previously, the only reason for my credit card debt is because\nof my trying to help my fiance get back on his feet after his accident. We\nare still trying to dig out of the hole and I am almost in the place where I\ncan start paying those bills again and get myself caught up. (Items 3, 4).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 26, 2007, revealed she was making her\nautomobile loan payments on time. She had taken out a loan of $20,341 in March 2005\n(Item 6) that she was repaying at $370 per month. She owed a total of $6,668 on five\nrevolving charge accounts that were rated as current, including a jewelry store debt with\na balance of $2,145 (high credit $7,600 opened in December 2005). The four accounts\nlisted as delinquent on her e-QIP had a balance of $9,296. She was also reportedly past\ndue on three student loans initially totaling $8,825 but now up to $9,572 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c,\n1.d, and 1.e).  The student loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been charged off. Also included\non her credit report was a $6,882 student loan reportedly taken out in January 2005 that\nwas in deferred status (Item 6). It is unclear whether this student loan is in addition to\nthose in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. Applicant listed on her e-QIP one semester of study\nat a community college in fall 1993. The discrepancy in dates between her studies and\nthe student loans cannot be resolved based on the limited information available for\nreview.\nOn December 3, 2007, Applicant responded to a request from DOHA to verify\npayments of her debts. She disputed that she owed as much as $3,090 on the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.h, but she admitted she had not paid anything on her four delinquent credit\ncard accounts or her three student loans. Applicant again cited the negative financial\nimpact of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s unemployment for three months, although she provided no\nspecifics of the income loss, and added that she was paying for her wedding scheduled\nfor late 2007. Applicant expressed her intent to make payments as soon as she was\nable. At DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) on\nwhich she indicated a net monthly remainder of $587.17 but zero assets (Item 7).\nOn January 19, 2008, Applicant entered into a consent judgment with the law\nfirm collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Under the terms of the consent judgment,\nApplicant was to pay $3,165.11, $1,000 due by January 25, 2008, and then $180\n\nIn her Answer, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.h on the basis that it had been paid off as shown in a letter proving\n3\nit had been satisfied. There is no such letter included in Item 2. Instead, there is a statement of her checking\naccount as of January 24, 2008, which shows a debit from her account of $963. However, Applicant provided\nin rebuttal to the form a letter confirming she had paid the $963 to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h (Ex. A).\nApplicant credibly indicated that she is repaying the student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e at $103 per month,\n4\nand that payments are being made to another creditor servicing the student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d. The available\nrecords confirming payments do not identify the student loans by their original account numbers. However,\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show that the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d were referred to the same collection\nagency so they are likely the loans being repaid at $103 monthly and that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is being\nrepaid through another assignee. Under existing repayment arrangements, she was paying $358.29 per\nmonth. Since $180 was going to the law firm collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f and $103 to the assignee for two\nof her student loans, her payment on the other student loan would be about $75 per month.\n4\nmonthly. On January 24, 2008, $963 was debited from Applicant\u2019s checking account to\nsettle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h.  On receipt of that payment, the creditor holding the debt\n3\nreleased her from any obligation to pay the remaining $404.04 debt balance (Item 2, Ex.\nA).\n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of February 3, 2008, showed updated outstanding\nbalances of $2,588 on SOR \u00b6 1.a, $2,547 on SOR \u00b6 1.b (SOR \u00b6 1.g, same debt),\n$4,533 in collection on SOR \u00b6 1.c, $2,887 in collection on SOR \u00b6 1.d, and $2,676 as a\ncharge off balance on SOR \u00b6 1.e. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h were reported as\ntransferred accounts with zero balances (Item 5). While the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h had been\nsettled (Ex. A), she had yet to make her first payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. Her\ncredit report included no new delinquent accounts (Item 5).\n \nOn or about February 11, 2008, Applicant made her first payment toward SOR \u00b6\n1.h under the consent agreement (Ex. A). On March 30, 2008, Applicant made a\npayment of $225 to bring the debt balance of SOR \u00b6 1.e to $2,070 (Item 2). The\npayment was sent before March 18, 2008, but was made by check dated March 30,\n2008. As of May 2008, she was paying $180 monthly on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, $103\nmonthly to the agency collecting the student loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, and\nabout $75 on the student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d.  Applicant had not yet contacted the\n4\ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a or 1.b. She had been unaware previously that the creditor in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b was a collecting agency for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. Once she satisfies\nexisting payment arrangements, she plans to contact the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and\n1.b. Applicant estimates that she has about $220 per month in discretionary funds but\nthis does not include any cost increases for food and fuel (Ex. A).\nApplicant has administrative responsibility for over 230 injured military personnel.\nShe has demonstrated professionalism, trustworthiness, and reliability in fulfilling her\nduties, which include leading a 20-person team. She has earned the strong\nendorsement of those military personnel who have had the opportunity to observe her\nwork ethic and dedication to the soldiers she serves (Ex. A).\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency on four credit card accounts and\nthree student loans. As of her response to DOHA interrogatories on December 3, 2007,\nApplicant had made no payments toward her total delinquent debt of about $19,763.\nSignificant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are too recent to satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6\n20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). When she completed her e-QIP\nin May 2007, Applicant disclosed four delinquent credit card obligations totaling about\n$10,000, a good estimate given she owed about $9,296 on those accounts. She also\nhad not repaid three student loan accounts that had been charged off and placed for\ncollection.\nApplicant has attributed her financial delinquencies to her fianc\u00e9 being out of\nwork for three months following a motorcycle accident in July 2005.  Mitigating condition\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d) is implicated. While she has not provided the\nspecific income and expense figures, her credit reports confirm that her financial\nproblems began in the summer of 2005 when she fell behind on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nHowever, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, she must have acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. She made no payments on the four delinquent credit card obligations or\non the three student loans between November 2006 and January 2008. Applicant\nexplained in December 2007 that she continued to struggle financially. While she\naverred that she had caught up in her \u201cmortgage\u201d payment, there is no indication that\nshe had a mortgage. On her PFS, she indicated she had a rental obligation of $300 a\nmonth. She also listed monthly discretionary income of $578.17, although this did not\ninclude any payments on her debts. Her credit reports reveal that she was repaying on\ntime a $7,600 jewelry store debt on an account opened in December 2005, her car loan\ntaken out in March 2005 at $370 per month, and a couple of open credit card accounts.\n\n7\nIt is unclear whether the car payment was included in the $740.67 she estimated in\nmonthly car expenses, but her discretionary funds were apparently going toward her\nwedding expenses. Applicant presented little to show that her expenses were\nreasonable and justified her complete disregard of the delinquent credit card and\nstudent loan debts for more than a year.\nAfter the assignee collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f filed a civil action against her,\nApplicant began repaying that debt. Before she received the SOR, she had also settled\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and had entered into repayment terms with the creditor collecting\nthe student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. Thereafter, she has made monthly payments\nof $103 on those student loans, and made at least one payment of $225 on the other.\nWhile Applicant has not furnished proof off all the payments made, her assertions of\nrepayment are accepted given her credibility as to her financial situation overall and the\nevidence of payments documented in the record. AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) does not fully\napply, given her efforts to resolve her debts are in response to collection efforts, in the\ncase of SOR \u00b6 1.f by resort to a civil complaint, and she has yet to even contact the\ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.\nAs to whether she has done enough to warrant favorable application of AG \u00b6\n20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d), Applicant is\nnot required to settle or satisfy each debt for classified access. However, there must be\nadequate assurances that her financial situation is stable and she is not likely to fall\nbehind in her financial obligations, including her living expenses, while she is repaying\nher delinquent accounts. Applicant has not provided a PFS since she has begun\nrepaying her delinquencies other than to indicate that with the payments she is making,\nher monthly net remainder \u201chas come down considerably to $219.88.\u201d (Ex. A). She\nremains concerned about the potential negative financial impact of any emergency\nsituation, which suggests a tight financial situation, although the figures she provided do\nnot include any income from her spouse. Her February 2008 credit report (Item 5) does\nnot show any continuing reliance on consumer credit and there is no evidence that she\nwas behind on her day-to-day expenses as of the close of the record in May 2008. In\nlight of her intent to continue to resolve her debts and the fact that she has the present\nmeans to do so, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. The amount of delinquent debt that\nremains to be paid is about $15,000. Applicant is not likely to engage in illegal acts\nbecause of the debt.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\npersons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all\ntimes. Applicant has not concealed from the government that she has had difficulty\nmeeting her financial obligations, due in part to an unforeseen accident that left her\nfuture spouse unable to work. She exhibited questionable judgment when she put her\npersonal interest in paying for her wedding ahead of her delinquent consumer credit and\nstudent loan obligations, but has shown good judgment of late in making efforts to\nresolve her debts. Military personnel who have had the opportunity to observe her work\nperformance attest to her dedication and reliability to the soldiers she serves. Despite\nthe recency of her financial problems, her candor with the Department of Defense and\nher ethical reputation at work strongly suggest she will make good on her intent, which\nis to continue to resolve her debts.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                                       \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her security clearance application (SCA) on May 15, 2007.\nOn February 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under the criminal conduct\nguideline (Guideline J), the drug involvement guideline (Guideline H), and the financial\nconsiderations guideline (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on February 26, 2008. She\nelected to have her case decided administratively without a hearing. A copy of the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of\nthe list of allegations in the SOR) was sent to Applicant on March 19, 2008. Applicant\nreceived the FORM on March 25, 2008. Applicant\u2019s response was due by April 25,\nMay 30, 2008\n\n2\n2008. No response was received. The case was assigned to this administrative judge\non May 9, 2008. Based upon a review of the FORM and the entire case file, Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted seven allegations under paragraph 1 (criminal conduct). She\nalso admitted all three allegations under paragraph 2 (drug involvement). Finally, she\nadmitted all 13 debts under paragraph 3 (financial considerations). Applicant provided\nno explanation for the criminal conduct. With regard to the drug allegations, Applicant\nclaimed she quit using drugs in 1998. Her explanation for the financial debts is that she\nwas trying to help family members. She then stated that, \u201cI have been paying things off.\u201d\nApplicant is 49 years old, and has been employed in several positions with her\ncompany since October 2000. She is currently a stock clerk. She seeks a secret\nsecurity clearance. \nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nWhen Applicant was approximately 34 or 35 years old, she pled guilty to driving\nwhile under the influence of a controlled substance. (SOR 1.g.) She was sentenced to\nfive years probation, 180 hours of community service, and ordered to attend a driving\nwhile under the influence (DUI) course. A bench warrant was issued after she failed to\ncomply with the terms of probation. \nOn March 9, 1995, Applicant was arrested for being under the influence of a\ncontrolled drug (SOR 1.e.), riding a bike under the influence of drugs, and disorderly\nconduct related to drugs. Applicant was accepted into a drug diversion program, but\nwas terminated for failing to comply with the requirements of the program. On August\n15, 1996, Applicant pled no contest to the drug possession charges, and was sentenced\nto 6 days in jail. The record does not disclose the status of her probationary sentence\nshe received in SOR 1.g. \nApplicant was arrested for possession of stolen property (SOR 1.f.) on July 9,\n1996. In August 1996, Applicant pled guilty to the charge. She received seven days in\njail and probation for three years. In October of the same year, Applicant was charged\nwith being under the influence of drugs; she was sentenced to 90 days imprisonment\nand three years probation. Her probation was terminated on February 1998, when she\nviolated the probation terms of the July 1996 offense, and the February 1998 offense in\nSOR 1.a.\nOn June 17, 1997 (SOR 1.c.), Applicant was charged with failure to stop, driving\nwhile license suspended, no insurance, and no registration. She failed to appear for\narraignment on the charge and a warrant was issued. On September 22, 1997,\nApplicant was sentenced to nine days in jail on the SOR 1.c. charge. On September 17,\n1997 (SOR 1.b.), Applicant  was charged with use/under the influence of controlled\n\n3\nsubstance (2 charges), presenting false identification to a police officer, possession of a\ncontrolled substance paraphernalia, and receiving stolen property. She was convicted\nand served time for the first two charges of possession of paraphernalia, and the\nparaphernalia charge. Applicant served 51 days in jail, followed by time on work\nrelease. While serving time on work release, she was charged with the SOR 1.a.\noffense. \nOn February 13, 1998 (SOR 1.a.), Applicant was charged with possession of\ncocaine base for sale, possession of a narcotic controlled substance, and use/under the\ninfluence of a controlled substance. Applicant received jail time (not gleaned from the\nrecord), and placed on probation for two years, which she completed in October 2000.\nDrug Involvement (DI)\nApplicant began using cocaine (SOR 2.a.) in 1990. She became dependent on\nthe drug, and by 1996, she was using the drug at least 2 or 3 times a week. (SOR 2.b.)\nIn addition to using the drug, she began to sell it to others in 1996. Applicant used\ncocaine until February 1998. (SOR 2.c.)\nFinancial Involvement (FI)\nThere are 13 delinquent debts listed under the financial guideline. The accounts\nare for utility bills, credit cards, furniture, and telephone service. The total amount of the\ndelinquent debt is $9,728.00. In her answers to interrogatories (Item 6), supplied to the\ngovernment of December 10, 2007, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement\n(PFS). The PFS reflects she has $1,215.00 of discretionary income left each month,\nafter subtracting her monthly expenses from her monthly income. The only explanation\nprovided by Applicant for the debts is that she was trying to help family members. She\nalso claimed she was paying the debts off. Applicant provided no additional\ndocumentation regarding the debt. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant stressed that the drug use and criminal conduct should no longer be a\nconcern as she has not been involved in either activity for 10 years. Her faith in her\nchurch helped her beat drug use. No additional information was provided.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare flexible rules of law that are applied in conjunction with the general policy factors of\nthe whole person concept.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-\nthe-clock responsibility. The Government places a high degree of trust and confidence\nin individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include\nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of\nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nCriminal behavior casts doubts concerning a person\u2019s judgment and\ntrustworthiness.\nDrug Involvement (DI)\nBesides being against the law, drug use fosters poor judgment.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nInability to pay bills in a responsible fashion raises the chances of irresponsible\nbehavior such as breaking the law to generate funds. \nAnalysis\n30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, and\nreliability. By it\u2019s very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct from 1993 to February 1998 establishes a pattern of\nbehavior that falls within CC (DC) 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\n\n5\noffenses) In 1993 (SOR 1.g.), Applicant exercised poor judgment by ingesting drugs\nand then attempted to operate a car. She exacerbated her conduct by not satisfying the\nterms of her probation, leading to a warrant for her arrest. In March 1995, Applicant was\ncharged with three new offenses related to her drug use. Applicant did not take\nadvantage of the drug diversion program, and the charges were reinstated, culminating\nin her no contest plea to disorderly conduct related to drugs. \n Over the next three years, Applicant was convicted of seven new charges\nrelating to her drug use. The charge in February 1998 was the most serious because\nApplicant was caught with paraphernalia, and provided a false identity to law\nenforcement in an effort to not have her true identity detected. \nEven though Applicant provided little information about how and why she stopped\ncommitting crimes, I believe her criminal conduct was a function of her drug use. When\nshe stopped using drugs, she stopped engaging in criminal behavior. Though the\nconduct was not isolated, it occurred in a five-year period, about 10 years ago. CC MC\n32.a. (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior occurred, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.\nCC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) also applies based on Applicant\u2019s credible though short\nexplanation of her church\u2019s role in convincing her to stop her criminal behavior and drug\ninvolvement in 1998. The combination of the passage of time and Applicant\u2019s church\ninvolvement convince me she will stand by her 10-year-old period of abstinence, and\ncontinue to forego all drug use in the future. \nDrug Involvement (DI)\nDI DC 25.a. (any drug abuse) and DI DC 25.c. (illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia) apply to Applicant\u2019s drug use that occurred between 1993 and\nFebruary 1998. DI MC 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) receives\nconsiderable attention when evaluated with a demonstrated intention not to engage in\nfuture use as set forth in DI MC 26.b. (1) (disassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts), (2) (changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used), and (3)\n(an appropriate period of abstinence). Applicant realizes that her religious faith stopped\nher drug use. I am confident she will continue her strong relationship with her church to\npreclude any possibility of sliding into drug use and probable criminal behavior. \n\n6\nFinancial Considerations (FC) \nTwo disqualifying conditions apply: FC DC 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Applicant\nhas carried some of this delinquent debt for three years or more without any effort on\nher part to resolve the debt individually or collectively. The only mitigating condition that\ncould apply is FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control, and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances). It is fair to conclude that Applicant\u2019s growing drug problem between\n1993 and 1998 had a negative impact on her overall finances. However, the termination\nof her drug problem in 1998 should have been a turning point in her life, allowing her to\ngain a new perspective on her objectives. Though she claims she was providing\nfinancial help for her family members, that decision to provide assistance was within her\ncontrol, and receives no recognition under FC MC 20.b. \nApplicant\u2019s claim she is trying to pay off debts calls for consideration of FC MC\n20.d. (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts). The condition does not apply as Applicant has provided no\ndocumentation of the debts she has paid. Without sufficient evidence to mitigate,\nextenuate, or explain the reasons why her debts became delinquent and/or documented\nefforts to repay the debts, Applicant\u2019s scant evidence in mitigation does not satisfy her\nultimate burden of demonstrating she is entitled to security clearance eligibility. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nWhile Applicant has met her burden of persuasion under the CC and DI\nguidelines, she has not shown she is entitled to a security clearance under the FC\nguideline. The same conclusion is reached even after the circumstances of this case\nare evaluated in the context of the whole person. Without a plan in progress that\nindicates an effort to repay the creditors, the FC guideline is resolved against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1b.\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor applicant\nSubparagraph 1f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1g.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): \nFOR APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b. \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), based on four delinquent debts totaling $23,381, including a delinquent \nstudent loan for $20,237. Applicant paid off all the debts except the student loan, and he \nhas been making regular payments on the student loan for six months. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on December 18, 2006. \nOn March 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \nJuly 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 19, 2008; answered it on \nMarch 31, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on April 4, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nApril 25, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on April 29, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on May 9, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 28, 2008. Applicant \nrequested additional time to prepare, and I granted his request. On May 29, 2008, \nDOHA issued a second notice of hearing, rescheduling the hearing for June 17, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until July 2, 2008, to enable him to \nsubmit additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted AX H through L, and they were \nadmitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX H through L is \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on June 26, 2008. The record closed on July 2, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old digital test technician employed by a federal contractor. \nHe has worked for his current employer since December 2006. He previously worked as \na temporary contract employee, supporting the same employer from January to \nDecember 2006. He has also been self-employed since December 2004, servicing and \nrepairing electronic scanning equipment (Tr. 48). He received an associate\u2019s degree in \nelectronic engineering and technology in 1991, and has been taking college classes to \nobtain his bachelor\u2019s degree since January 2000 (Tr. 6, 39-40). He is unmarried and \nhas three children, ages 20, 15, and 8, who live with him and his girlfriend (Tr. 41). He \nhad an interim clearance until the SOR was issued, but he has never held a final \nsecurity clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application reflects he was laid off from work and \nunemployed from July 2003 to September 2003. He was injured on the job in January \n2004 and unemployed until April 2004. He was laid off again in May 2005 and \nunemployed until September 2005. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor describes him as dedicated, extremely conscious \nof security procedures, hard-working, respectful, and a team player (AX L). A co-worker \nregards him as a dedicated employee and a \u201cgreat asset\u201d to his company (AX K). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts: a medical debt (\u00b6 1.a), a utility bill (\u00b6 \n1.b), a credit card account (\u00b6 1.c), and a delinquent student loan (\u00b6 1.d). The medical \ndebt was for treatment of Applicant\u2019s injuries in an automobile accident in 2004. He \nthought all medical bills had been paid by insurance, but his credit report reflected a \ndelinquent debt for $851. He contacted the collection agency and paid $756, the \namount the agency claimed due on the account. He has been unable to identify the \ncreditor, if any, for the remaining $95 listed on his credit report, but is willing to pay it if \nthe creditor can be identified (Tr. 33-34). Applicant\u2019s credit report dated June 30, 2008 \nreflects a zero balance on this account (AX I at 1). \n \n \nThe utility bill in SOR \u00b6 1.b arose after Applicant sold his house in 2005. The \nutility company had been estimating his bills, but they read the meter after Applicant \nmoved and determined he owed $2,994. This bill appears to include the cost of \ninstalling a water heater (Tr. 35). The debt has been paid in full (AX B; Tr. 34-35). \n \n \nThe $55 delinquent credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was on an account \nopened in 2006. In January 2008, Applicant received an offer to settle the account for \n$600, paid it, and received a letter from the collection attorneys stating the account had \nbeen settled (AX E; Tr. 35-36). Applicant\u2019s credit report dated June 30, 2008, reflects a \nzero balance on this account (AX I at 1). \n \n \nApplicant is in a loan rehabilitation program for the delinquent student loan \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant\u2019s mother co-signed his student loans around 1988, and \napplicant sent his mother $150 per month to pay the loans starting in 2000. He was \nunaware that there were two separate loans and his mother was not making the \npayments on one of them. He discovered the account was delinquent when he was \ninterviewed by a security investigator (GX 7 at 2-3). His credit reports reflected that the \nlast activity on this account, with a balance of $20,237, was in February 2004 (GX 4 at \n3; GX 5 at 2; GX 6 at 9). He has been making monthly payments of $220 by automatic \ndebit from his checking account since January 2008. If he adheres to the monthly \npayment plan, his account will be rehabilitated and considered current after he makes \nthe October 2008 payment (AX G; AX J). \n \n \nApplicant testified that the security investigator \u201cdid [him] a favor\u201d by confronting \nhim with his delinquent debts, because he had taken his good credit for granted and did \nnot pay enough attention to his financial situation (Tr. 45). He now pays close attention \nto his finances and subscribes to a credit monitoring service (Tr. 46). \n \n \nApplicant works about 20 hours a week and earns about $3,000 per month as a \ngovernment contractor. He earns between $500 and $1,500 per month from his private \nbusiness (Tr. 48). He submitted a personal financial statement in January 2008, \nreporting total net monthly income of about $3,936 per month and monthly expenses \nbetween $2,885 and $3,235, leaving a remainder between $1,051 and $701. He went \nthrough a period of accumulating debts, but now his only outstanding debt is the student \nloan (Tr. 51). His car is paid for, and he has no credit cards (Tr. 51). He has about \n\n \n4 \n \n \n$30,000 in checking accounts, and he intends to use these funds to purchase a house \n(Tr. 66). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not \nraised because there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d Since the \ngovernment produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), (c) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \n\n \n6 \n \n \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established, \nbecause Applicant had multiple delinquent debts and the student loans are still in the \nprocess of being rehabilitated. The medical bills attributable to his automobile accident \narose from circumstances that are \u201cunlikely to recur,\u201d but the utility bills, delinquent \ncredit card account, and delinquent student loan did not arise from unusual \ncircumstances. The final prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) is established by Applicant\u2019s \naggressive responses to his delinquent debts after he learned about them and his \nproactive measures to prevent recurrence. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established for the \nmedical bills, but not for the others. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. The automobile \naccident giving rise to the delinquent medical bills was beyond Applicant\u2019s control, and \nhe has resolved this debt. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment also were beyond his \ncontrol, but his unemployment ended before the delinquent credit card account was \nopened, and his unemployment appears to have been unrelated to the medical bills. He \ndid not attribute his delinquent student loans to unemployment, but rather to being \nunaware that there were two loans and his mother was paying only one. I conclude AG \n\u00b6 20(b) is established for the medical bills, but not for the others. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive. If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. Applicant has not \nreceived counseling, but it appears his financial problems are under control. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant was unaware of some \ndelinquent debts until he applied for a security clearance. Upon learning of his \ndelinquent debts, he took prompt and aggressive action. His only outstanding debt is his \nstudent loan, and it appears to be under control. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nproduced evidence that he paid the balances in full for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.c, and he produced a recent credit report showing zero balances on both \naccounts. He is willing to pay these two small amounts if the creditors can be identified. \nI conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent, educated adult. He was sincere, candid, well \nprepared, and credible at the hearing. Like many applicants, he did not pay attention to \nhis credit history until he applied for a clearance and discovered that his financial record \nraised security concerns. Confronted with the facts, he responded promptly and \naggressively.  \n \n \nApplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \neach and every debt alleged in the SOR. All that is required is that he demonstrate that \nhe has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant \nactions to implement that plan.\u201d ADP Case No. 18900 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008), \n\n \n8 \n \n \nciting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006) and ISCR Case No. 02-\n25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2005). Applicant has resolved all the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR except for the student loan on which he has been making regular \npayments for six months. Based on his recent track record and his credible testimony at \nthe hearing, I am confident that he will continue making payments on his student loans \nuntil the account is rehabilitated.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

He travels to Nigeria twice a year to fulfill \nhis village duties and does not wish to renounce his Nigerian citizenship for it might \ninterfere with his travel to Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s wife, mother, and the majority of his \nsiblings and step-siblings are citizens and residents of Nigeria. Additionally, he had 26 \npast due and delinquent accounts totaling more than $35,000. Applicant\u2019s personal \nconduct is not of security concern. However, Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign \ninfluence, foreign preference, and financial consideration security concerns. Clearance \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 24, 2008, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline C, foreign influence, based on his Nigerian duties as a village \nchief, Guideline B, foreign preference due to his wife, mother, siblings and fiance who \nare citizens and residents of Nigeria, and Guideline F, financial considerations, based \non a history of financial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts. \n  \n \nOn February 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nMay 20, 2008, the SOR was amended to strike some of the duplicate debts, to add \nallegations under SOR \u00b6 1.c and 2.d, and to allege security concerns under Guideline \nE, for personal conduct, based on failure to disclose owing foreign land and failing to list \na 1994 arrest and a 2005 conviction. On June 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR. \nOn June 10, 2008, I was assigned the case. On July 10, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on July 23, 2008. The government offered Exhibits \n(Ex.) 1 through 8, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Exhibits A through C, which were admitted into evidence. On \nAugust 6, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Nigeria. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Items I\u2500V. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies he owns land in Nigeria in response \nto the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.d, and 4.a. He denied 13 of the debts and admitted the \nremainder indicating the majority of the debts had been incurred prior to his divorce. \nThe admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of \nthe record, case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old quality control manager who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since August 2001, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Nigeria. In October 1976, unable to find work in Nigeria \nApplicant moved to the U.S. He intended to return to Nigeria when he finished \nschooling. Due to hard times in Nigeria, including a military coup, his parents \nencouraged him to stay in the U.S. In December 1989, he became a U.S. citizen. In \nSeptember 2001, he obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in construction management from a \nstate university in California. (Ex. 8) He has spent 32 years in the U.S. (Tr. 41) \n \n \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\nApplicant\u2019s father had two wives and is now deceased as is Applicant\u2019s step-\nmother. His father was the Minister of Information. (Ex. 8) His mother, a citizen and \nresident of Nigeria, was a business woman with whom he has weekly telephone \ncontact. Applicant sends his mother $1,000 per year for her living expenses. (Tr. 44) His \nsiblings also contribute to his mother\u2019s support. His wife is a citizen and resident of \nNigeria with whom he has telephone communications three times a day. They married \nin December 2006. He had anticipated she would complete her immigration paperwork \nand move to the U.S by the end of 2007. His wife remains in Nigeria. \n \n \nPrior his death, Applicant\u2019s father was the chief of his village of 400 to 500 \npeople. (Tr. 94, Ex. 8) When his father died in 2005, by tradition, Applicant, being the \nfirst son, became chief of the village. (Tr. 35) Since becoming chief, Applicant has \nreturned to Nigeria twice a year to fulfill his duties as chief. He spends two to three \nweeks during each trip in Nigeria. (Tr. 93) Applicant intends to continue doing so for the \nrest of his life. Duties include: leading the village, settling disputes with other villages, \nsettling disputes within his village, and handling punishments for those who do illegal \nthings in the village. He reviews disputes dealing with theft and adultery. (Tr. 37, Ex. 8) \nHe is required to be present in June and December each year for annual festivals. Each \ntrip to Nigeria costs between $1,000 and $1,600. (Tr. 91) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father owned 100 acres of land on which his father had his house. \nThe land is family land not owed exclusively by Applicant. (Tr. 37) In 2005, Applicant \nstarted building a house for himself on this land. The house is worth approximately \n$10,000. (Tr. 42) He does not intend to move permanently to Nigeria until much later in \nhis life. Applicant relinquished his Nigerian passport when he obtained his U.S. \npassport. Applicant states he is a loyal U.S. citizen, but is concerned about renouncing \nhis Nigerian citizenship because he does not know the impact renouncing might have \non his travel to Nigeria. He will not renounce his Nigerian citizenship if it would affect his \nability to travel to Nigeria.  \n \n \nApplicant lives with a sister in the U.S. who is an administrator and dual U.S. and \nNigerian citizen. Applicant has a step-brother who is a computer analyst living in the \nU.S. with whom he has had no contact in 10 years. He has another step-brother who is \nan electrical engineer in California who he contacts every two years. The remainder of \nhis seven siblings and eight step-siblings are citizens and residents of Nigeria. \n \nOne of his sisters is a retired nursing administrator (Tr. 47); another is a business \nwoman with whom he has contact three times a month; one sister who is a teacher with \nwhom he has weekly contact (Tr. 51); he does not know his one sister\u2019s occupation; \nanother sister is a retired police commissioner. Applicant has a brother who is a teacher \nin Nigeria with whom Applicant has monthly telephone contact. (Tr. 50, Ex. 8) Applicant \ndoes not know the occupation of one of his brothers. Another brother is a local \ngovernment chairman of his village. This brother is an elected government official, a \nvice local building chairman working for the governor. (Tr. 53) \n \nApplicant step-sister is a retired police commissioner in Nigeria. (Tr. 52, 56, Ex. \n8) His contact with her is every three years. He has two step-sisters who are business \n\n \n \n \n4\nwomen/traders, one of which he has not spoken with in seven years and the other he \nsees twice a year; one step-sister is an attorney with whom he has had no contact in 10 \nyears; a step-sister is a teacher; and one step-sister is deceased. \n \nApplicant was married from June 1995 to November 2005. Applicant and his ex-\nwife share legal custody of their four children all born in the U.S. His ex-wife has \nphysical custody of the children. Applicant was ordered to pay $1,700 per month in child \nsupport. He was also required to maintain insurance for the children until his ex-wife \ncompletes her education to be a nurse. At the time of their divorce, Applicant\u2019s wife was \nmaking $50,000 a year and his yearly salary was $75,000. (Tr. 96) \n \n \nIn October 2004, Applicant was charged with second degree assault and assault \nwith a deadly weapon with the intent to injure. His wife alleged Applicant pursued her \nwith a knife. Applicant asserts it was a frame-up. (Tr. 80) In May 2005, he was convicted \nof the charge. Applicant was court ordered to see a psychologist, which he did twice a \nweek for two months and then once a week for four months. (Ex. 8) He was sentenced \nto three years and two years in prison, respectively. The judgment was stayed. (Ex. A) \nThe prison sentences were suspended and he was place on probation until May 2007. \n(Ex. 3) Following the October 2004 incident, Applicant\u2019s then wife filed for divorce.  \n \n \nIn 1994, Applicant had been at a bar drinking with friends. Applicant, then age \n39, stopped to give a woman standing on a street corner a ride and was arrested for \nsoliciting a prostitute. He thought the woman was a hitchhiker. (Tr. 82) He was taken to \nthe police station and released. He does not remember being charged, paying bond, \nhiring an attorney, or appearing in court. (Tr. 82) In 1994, he was convicted of disorderly \nconduct (prostitution) and sentenced to 12 months probation. (Ex. 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts in question totaling approximately $27,000. \nApplicant admits debts totaling approximately $14,500 and denies the remainder. \nApplicant has not contacted some of his creditors about his delinquent debt because he \nwould not be able to pay them. (Tr. 69)  \n \n \nIn 2003, a civil suit was filed against Applicant by his landlord who claimed \nApplicant owed more than $5,000 in unpaid rent. Applicant thought his then wife was \nmaking the payments. In April 2004, the judgment was satisfied. In July 2008, an order \nof satisfaction was entered as to the credit card debt listed in SOR \u00b6 3.m ($1,115). (Tr. \n28, Ex. B) The creditor of the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 3.y ($1,212) has offered to settle the \nmatter for $600. There is no documentation Applicant accepted the offer or made \npayment in compliance with the offer. \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant completed a sworn interview (Ex. 8) Applicant asserts he \ndisputes ten debts, seven of which are listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.c, 3.f, 3.i, 3k, \n3.o and 3.q). Applicant stated he should have to pay only the debts he was responsible \nfor and would establish repayment plans for those debts. He anticipated those debts \nwould be paid by June 2007. (Ex. 8) He did not provide documentation showing the \nbasis of the disputes. \n \n\n \n \n \n5\nAs of June 2006, Applicant gross monthly salary was $6,200. Applicant makes \n$776 monthly payments on his car, which he purchased three years ago. He owes \n$27,000 on his car. Applicant monthly remainder after paying other expenses and \ndeductions was $1,417. (Ex. 8) Applicant estimates his discretionary income at $1,200 \nper month. (Tr. 78) Applicant did not provide a budget. (Tr. 79) He has not received \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 80)  \n \nApplicant acknowledged the telephone debt in SOR \u00b6 3.j ($866). His wife had \nincurred the telephone bill prior their divorce. He indicated he would contact the creditor \nand set up a repayment plan by June 2007. This was not done. Applicant asserts that \nduring a three week separation his then wife ran up a $5,279 telephone bill. (SOR \u00b6 3.q) \nApplicant does not want to pay this bill because his ex-wife incurred the debt. (Tr. 73, \nEx. 8) The divorced decree did not require his ex-wife to pay the bill. At the time of the \ndivorce, he just wanted to get it over with and many things went unaddressed. (Tr. 73) \n \n \nThe state alleged Applicant was delinquent on this child support payments. \nApplicant denies being delinquent. Applicant has an automatic deduction of $1,994 \nmonthly paid directly from his wages. SOR \u00b6 3.v ($1,093) is a department store credit \ncard debt. Applicant stopped making payment on this debt when his account was not \nproperly credited with merchandize he had returned. Applicant disputes the amount \nowed on the discount department store credit card listed in SOR \u00b6 3.w ($702). (Ex. 8) \nHe assets he charged $124 and the remainder is interest and penalties. (Ex. 8) \n \n \nApplicant purchased jewelry for $2,451 (SOR \u00b6 3.x) with $50 monthly payments. \nWhen he made a second purchase the monthly payment rose to $125, which he could \nafford and the debt became delinquent. Applicant is talking with his attorney about \nsettling the department store debt (SOR \u00b6 3.v, $1,093). At one time, Applicant was \nrepaying his gasoline credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 3.z, $953), but is no longer doing so. The \ndelinquent debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 75)  \n \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In section 17, \u201cYour Foreign Activities\u201d he was asked \nif he had any foreign property. He answered \u201cno\u201d even though he was building a house \nin Nigeria. Applicant states he misunderstood the question. (Tr. 62) In reading the \nquestion, Applicant concentrated on the business connections and financial interest part \nof the question. \n \n \nIn response to section 23, \u201cYour Police Record,\u201d Applicant listed his November \n2005 domestic arrest. He did not list nor was he required to list his February 1994 arrest \nfor soliciting a prostitute on either his September 2006 SF-86 or his December 2001, \nPublic Trust Position Applicant, Standard Form (SF) 85P. The question of each form \nrestricts the time frame in question to the previous seven years. The 1994 arrest was \noutside of the period of review.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n                                                          \nNigeria \n \n \nNigeria is a western Africa federal republic that has experienced periods of \npolitical instability, turmoil, and economic crisis since obtaining its independence from \nBritain in 1960. Military coups and long military-imposed transitions rather than civilian \nrule are part of Nigerian political history.2 The military has ruled Nigeria for \napproximately 28 of its 43 years since independence.3  \n \nIn May 1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule. In the eight years since the end of \nmilitary rule, Nigeria has suffered serious ethnic/religious conflicts.4 Areas of Nigeria are \nmarked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed conflicts between religious, \npolitical, and ethnic factions.5 \n \n \nNigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country with over 250 ethnic groups with the \nmajority of people living in extreme poverty.6 Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest oil producer and \nits oil wealth is a continuing source of political tension and civil unrest. Ongoing ethnic \nand religious conflicts are often based upon resentment between the northern and \nsouthern regions of the country over perceived unfairness in the distribution of the \nsubstantial oil revenues.7 The Northern two-thirds of the country is Muslim and the \nsouthern third is a mix of Muslims and Christians.8 \n \n \nLack of law and order in Nigeria poses considerable risks to travelers, including \narmed robbery and kidnapping.9 Violent crime, committed by ordinary criminals, as well \nas by persons in police or military uniforms can occur throughout the country. U.S. \ncitizens are warned of the deteriorating security situation in the oil rich Niger Delta \nregion. Kidnapping for ransom in the area remains high. \n \n \nThe Nigerian government\u2019s human rights record is poor, and the government \ncontinues to commit serious human rights abuses.10 Nigerian government officials at all \n \n2 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of African Affairs, Background Note; Nigeria, April 2008 (Background \nNotes) at 1.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n \n \n11 Id. (Ex. V) \n\n \n \n \n8\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Preference \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 9 articulates the security concerns relating \nto foreign preference problems: \n  \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \n \nAG & 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n \n \n(1) possession and/or use of a foreign passport; \n \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country; \n \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in the foreign country; \n \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American \ncitizen; \n  \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve \nthe interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or government in conflict \nwith the national security interest; and \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the \nUnited States; for example, declaration of intent to renounce United States \ncitizenship; renunciation of United states citizenship. \n \nAG & 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign \ncountry; \n\n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n(b) individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred \nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s father died, Applicant as the eldest son, became chief of his \nvillage. He travels to Nigeria twice a year to fulfill his obligations. Applicant intends to \ncontinue doing so for the rest of his life. In 2005, Applicant started building himself a \nhouse on his father\u2019s land. He is required to be present in June and December each \nyear for annual festivals and stays two or three weeks on each visit. He does not intend \nto move permanently to Nigeria until much later in his life, but is concerned about \nrenouncing his Nigerian citizenship because he does not know the impact renouncing \nmight have on his travel to Nigeria. He will not renounce his Nigerian citizenship if it \nwould affect his ability to travel to Nigeria.  \n \nAccepting the role of village chief, traveling to Nigeria twice a year to fulfill those \nduties, and reluctance to renounce his Nigerian citizenship shows a foreign preference. \nAs village chief, Applicant adjudicates punishments and penalties to those who violate \nrules. SOR & 10.c None of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s family owns 100 acres of land in Nigeria on which he is building a \nhouse. Applicant is not the exclusive owner of the land. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor as to \nSOR & 1.c.  \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n\n \n \n \n10\n \n \nAG & 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that \nthe individual=s access to protected information may involve unacceptable \nrisk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their \ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress \nexists; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation;  \n \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with foreign national; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nations from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country.  \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n\n \n \n \n11\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority.  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nAG & 7(a), 7(b), and 7(c) all apply because of Applicant\u2019s contact with \nfamily members (especially his wife), role in his village, and property in Nigeria. \n \nAG & 8(a) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s wife, mother, siblings, and step-\nsiblings are citizens and residents of Nigeria. Applicant lives with his sister in the \nU.S. He has daily contact with his wife who is a citizen and resident of Nigeria. \nHe has weekly contact with his mother, monthly contact with a brother, talks with \nhis other siblings less frequently, and sees his relatives when he visits Nigeria \ntwice a year. \u201cIt is unlikely [he] will be place in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interest of [his mother and sibling] and the interest of the U.S.\u201d his \ninfrequent contacts (once or twice a year) and not particularly close relationship \nwith his Nigerian relatives have a very low potential for forcing him to choose \nbetween the United States and Nigeria. He met his burden of showing there is \n\u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his Nigerian relatives] could create a \nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation.  \n \nAG & 8(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s brother is an elected government \nofficial, a vice local building chairman working for the governor. His step-sister is \na retired police commissioner in Nigeria. There is no evidence that his mother or \nother relatives are or have been political activists, or are challenging the policies \nof the Nigerian Government. There is no evidence his wife, mother or other \nsiblings, except for his brother and step-sister, currently work or have ever \nworked for the Nigerian Government, military, or new media, or that of any other \n\n \n \n \n12\nforeign government. There is no evidence that terrorists or the Nigerian \nGovernment have approached or threatened Applicant or his relatives for any \nreason. There is no evidence that his relatives living in Nigeria currently engage \nin activities which would bring attention to them or that they or other Nigerian \nelements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced \npossibility that his relatives or Applicant would be targets for coercion or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.\u201d Applicant lives with his sister in the U.S. who is a dual U.S. and \nNigerian citizen. Applicant was born in Nigeria 53 years ago, but has lived 32 \nyears in the U.S. He obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in construction management \nin the U.S. and has worked for defense contractors for seven years. These \nmitigating conditions taken together are sufficient to fully overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns for all of his relatives except for his wife. He has such \na close relationship with his wife, and such frequent contact with her that security \nconcerns pertaining to SOR & 1.c are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owes approximately $24,000 on 19 past due obligations, even \nthough he only admitted past due debt of $14,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\n \n \n \n13\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nIn 2005, Applicant was divorced and went from a combined family income of \n$125,000 to a single income of $75,000. Applicant=s financial problems were contributed \nto by his $1,700 per month child support obligation (SOR & 3.l, $1,553 and & 3.p, $561) \non which he is current. He is current on his $776 monthly car payments. It cost $2,000 \nto $3,200 per year for Applicant to return to Nigeria to fulfill his duties as chief. After \nexpenses he has $1,200 monthly for discretionary spending. \n \nAG & 20(a) does not apply because the majority of his debts remain unpaid and \nhis debts were not infrequent because there are 19 debts. Nor did they occur under \nunusual circumstances. The debts were joint obligations made while Applicant was \nmarried and either does not want to pay or refuses to pay.  \n \nAG & 20(b) does not apply. Although Applicant was divorced, the divorce \noccurred three years ago and even with $1,200 a month of discretionary income only \none debt (SOR & 3.m, $1,115) has been paid. Applicant has not acted reasonably \nunder the circumstances.  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and there is no indication the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. AG & 20(c) does not apply. \n\n \n \n \n14\n \nApplicant has paid the credit card debt listed in SOR & 3.m ($1,115). AG & 20(d) \napplies to this debt and his child support obligation. An offer has been made by a \ncreditor to settle a debt (SOR & 3.y, $1,212) for $600. There is no documentation \nshowing Applicant has accepted the offer or made payment in accord with the offer. I \nfind against Applicant as to SOR & 3.y.  \n \nAC & 20(e) legitimately disputing a debt does not apply to any of the bills. \nApplicant does not want to pay the telephone debt in SOR & 3.q ($5,279) because his \nex-wife incurred the bill. However, the debt was incurred during the marriage and the \ndivorce decree does not require his ex-wife to pay the debt. Either Applicant has failed \nto show his dispute concerning his debts was reasonable or he has failed to provide \ndocumentation showing the basis of his dispute, or both.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government has shown Applicant's answer to a question in Section 17 was \nincorrect, but this does not prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information \nabout his finances. Applicant has denied intentional falsification. Deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement \nto the Government when applying for a security clearance is a security concern. But \nevery inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and \nmaterial. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  \n \n \nThe omission related to a house and land in Nigeria. Applicant does not have \nexclusive use of the land in Nigeria, but is building a house on the property. The \nquestion asked Applicant if he had any foreign property, business connections, or \nfinancial interests. In answering the question, Applicant was thinking about the \n\u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201cfinancial interest\u201d aspects of the question when he answered \u201cno.\u201d He \nshould have listed the house, but did not think the question was asking about a private \nhome. Applicant did not provide an intentionally false answer. \n \n \nIn response to his arrests, Applicant did list the November 2005 domestic arrest. \nHe could have given more information about being found guilty in May 2005, but he \ndoes not appear he was trying to hide the arrest from the government.  \n \n \nHis SF-86 and 85P asked Applicant about his arrests during the seven years \nprior the completion of the forms. The 1994 arrest for soliciting a prostitute was not \nwithin the seven-year time period. Applicant was not required to list this arrest. Applicant \ndid not show questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules for failing to list the 1994 arrest, failing to list the family land in Nigeria, \nor failing to provide a fuller explanation of his 2005 arrest that resulted in the 2006 \nconviction.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n15\nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has relatives who are \ncitizens and residents of Nigeria. His contact with them is limited except for his wife, \nwho he contacts daily. However, he is chief of his village and does not what to give up \nthat duty or renounce his Nigerian citizenship because doing so might interfere with his \ntravel to Nigeria. He is building a house there, which indicates he is planning on living in \nNigeria at some future time. He has delinquent debts which have not been adequately \naddressed.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence, \nforeign preference and financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n \n \n16\n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.l, 3.m,  \nand 3.p: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.r-3.u: \nStruck as duplications of other debts. \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-k, 3.n, \n3.o, 3.q, and 3v-z: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.c:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has a General Educational Development (GED) high school equivalency certificate and attended trade school. He has been married for 18 years. He was previously married three times, twice to the same woman. He has three adult children from his earlier relationships and two children with his current wife.1 Applicant was having health issues in 2004. He drank beer every day after work. He smoked more than a pack of cigarettes a day since he was a teenager. His wife had brain surgery in about February 2004. He started drinking more to relieve the stress. He had gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with severe nausea, high blood pressure, anxiety, and increased liver enzymes, which were related to his drinking. He lost weight. His doctor recommended that he stop drinking. She put him on a Valium detoxification as an outpatient to stop his drinking, but it was unsuccessful. Applicant did not like how the Valium made him feel. His doctor recommended that he undergo detoxification in a hospital. She told him that there could be health concerns if he attempted to stop drinking on his own. Applicant stated that she told him that he could \u201cstroke out\u201d and die if he stopped drinking without medical care.

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol use. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn October 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 19, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 11, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 26, 2009, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 17, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one \nApril 6, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nwitness, and submitted Exhibit (AE) A, which was received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 25, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a General \nEducational Development (GED) high school equivalency certificate and attended trade \nschool. He has been married for 18 years. He was previously married three times, twice \nto the same woman. He has three adult children from his earlier relationships and two \nchildren with his current wife.1  \n \n \nApplicant was having health issues in 2004. He drank beer every day after work. \nHe smoked more than a pack of cigarettes a day since he was a teenager. His wife had \nbrain surgery in about February 2004. He started drinking more to relieve the stress. He \nhad gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with severe nausea, high blood pressure, \nanxiety, and increased liver enzymes, which were related to his drinking. He lost weight. \nHis doctor recommended that he stop drinking. She put him on a Valium detoxification \nas an outpatient to stop his drinking, but it was unsuccessful. Applicant did not like how \nthe Valium made him feel. His doctor recommended that he undergo detoxification in a \nhospital. She told him that there could be health concerns if he attempted to stop \ndrinking on his own. Applicant stated that she told him that he could \u201cstroke out\u201d and die \nif he stopped drinking without medical care. He was admitted to a hospital on May 11, \n2004, pursuant to his doctor\u2019s advice, for a three-day detoxification to help him quit \ndrinking. This was not an alcohol rehabilitation center or program; he entered for a \nlimited time and a limited purpose. Medical records indicated that he reported \u201cdaily \nalcohol use of 6-10 tallboys per day.\u201d Another medical document reported \u201c24+ \ntallboys.\u201d Applicant testified that figure was not his daily consumption. It referred to how \nmuch he could possibly drink if he was camping or doing some other type of recreation. \nHe admitted that the medical report was accurate in that he was drinking between six \nand ten beers a day at that time. He reported under pain/discomfort that he had \n\u201cstomach pain; nausea; feeling of need to vomit,\u201d and that he drank beer for the pain. \nHe was diagnosed by a physician (M.D.) as alcohol dependent.2 \n \n \nApplicant discharged himself from the hospital on May 13, 2004. He did not like \nthe hospital. He felt it was dirty, with a bad smell, and the patients were people with \nmany problems. He equated it to a \u201chomeless shelter.\u201d The medical report indicated that \nhe did not require detoxification during his stay at the hospital. Applicant was not \ninterested in an outpatient or inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program or in attending \nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings. He believed that he could stop on his own. He stated \nthat he did not drink for about four months. He then started drinking again out of \nboredom and to relax. He stated that he drank less than he did before, \u201cI reprogrammed \nas that I\u2019m getting older; just drink a few in the evening and call it after that.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 30-32, 52-53; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-28, 32-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-27, 44-45; GE 2. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories concerning his alcohol use on \nJanuary 5, 2008. He indicated that he drank a six pack of beer a day, but he did not \ndrink to the point of intoxication. He wrote that he drank beer to relax and that he \u201clike[d] \nto drink a few beers in the evening to unwind.\u201d4 \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated by his doctor on August 24, 2008, pursuant to a request \nby DOHA to follow-up on his previous evaluation of alcohol dependence. The doctor \nforwarded a letter and an evaluation to DOHA on September 8, 2008. The letter noted:  \n \nI had the opportunity to see [Applicant] recently. Paperwork from your \noffice was reviewed, and a copy of the office visit is included. This is not a \nproblem that I have discussed with the patient previously, so all \ninformation is from your letter and the office visit. From his history, it does \nsound like he has problems with alcohol dependence. He does have \nhealth issues that would certainly improve with discontinuation of alcohol \ncompletely. It sounds like he does use alcohol as a method to decrease \nstress and tension, so I have placed him on medication to help from the \nstandpoint of relieving those issues. Since I last saw him, he has \ndecreased his alcohol to two beers daily. He will see me again in the next \ncouple of weeks for followup. With his current concerns related to his \nemployment and health, hopefully this will give him added willpower to \ndiscontinue alcohol completely, which is what I have recommended to \nhim. I believe that setting him up with a therapist who deals with alcohol \ndependence would be advantageous in the long term for helping him meet \nhis goal. \n \nThe doctor did not diagnose Applicant with alcohol dependence. He made an \nassessment of \u201c[h]istory of alcohol habituation.\u201d5 \n \nApplicant questions the alcohol dependence diagnosis, and whether he is an \nalcoholic. Since 2005, he has deployed to Iraq or Kuwait five times for about three to six \nmonths each deployment. He does not drink while he is deployed and had no Ill effect \nfrom going for extended periods without alcohol. He does not believe that he could do \nso if he was alcohol dependent. He does not have a criminal record and there is no \nevidence of any alcohol-related incidents. He denies that drinking has affected his \nemployment.6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was asked if she believes he is an alcoholic. She does not \nbelieve he is an alcoholic, but would like him to stop because of his health issues. She \nstated that he will go several weeks where he drinks beer every evening, and then he \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n4 GE 4. \n \n5 Tr. at 45-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3. \n \n6 Tr. at 21, 25-31, 42, 54-56. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nwill go for periods where he does not drink at all. On weeknights, he will drink less than \na six pack. On weekends, he may drink a little more than during the week, but not to the \npoint of what she considers to be intoxication. In their 18 years of marriage she has \nnever seen him drunk. She confirmed that he has not missed work because of his \ndrinking.7 \n \nApplicant currently drinks between two to four beers each night after work. He \ndrinks to relax and unwind after work. He worked construction for a large part of his life. \nIt was normal to have a couple beers after a day of physical labor. He admitted that he \nwill drink more than that on the weekends, if he is doing yard work, at a function, or \ncamping.8 \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded both professionally and personally. He submitted 11 \ncharacter letters from people who have known or worked with him going back to his \nchildhood, including the mother of one of his children and two former spouses. He is \ndescribed as steadfast, honest, hardworking, dedicated, truthful, responsible, and \ntrustworthy. He has received several Letters of Achievement from the military units he \nhas supported. An Army sergeant first class, who deployed multiple times to Iraq, wrote \nthat Applicant is technically proficient and extremely professional. He wrote that the \nequipment that Applicant serviced help save lives in Iraq, and that he was a huge asset \nto their unit. Applicant has been a regular volunteer and contributor to the American \nLegion, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Veterans Administration Hospital, the local \nhomeless shelter, and other charities. He is recommended for a security clearance.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 57-60. \n \n8 Tr. at 20, 27-28, 38, 45. \n \n9 AE A. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; and \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \nApplicant was diagnosed by a physician of alcohol dependence. He drinks \ntwo to four beers each night after work and on occasions much more than that. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c) and (d) as disqualifying conditions. \nHis short stay at the hospital does not constitute completion of an alcohol \nrehabilitation program. AG \u00b6 22(f) is not applicable \n \nTwo Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \n \nApplicant does not have any alcohol-related arrests or alcohol-related incidents. \nHis wife is concerned about his drinking because of his health. He is a hardworking man \nfrom a construction background who is used to drinking several beers after work to \nrelax. What he does is perfectly legal. It has not affected his work or his relationships. \nHe goes for months at a time without drinking while he is deployed. I find that his \ndrinking occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) is partially applicable. \n \nApplicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2004. His doctor evaluated him \nin 2008, upon DOHA\u2019s request. He wrote after reviewing the documents provided by \nDOHA that \u201cit does sound like he has problems with alcohol dependence.\u201d He did not \ndiagnose Applicant as alcohol dependent, but he made an assessment of \u201c[h]istory of \nalcohol habituation.\u201d Applicant has established a pattern of responsible use, but he is \nnot completely abstinent. AG \u00b6 23(b) is not applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is 45 \nyears old. He is a hardworking man from a construction background who has grown \naccustomed to drinking beer after work. His drinking has affected his health and his wife \nwould like him to quit because of that. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2004. \nHis personal physician did not diagnose him as alcohol dependent in 2008, but noted \nthat \u201cit sound[s] like he has problems with alcohol dependence.\u201d There are no alcohol-\nrelated arrests or incidents. He is very highly regarded professionally and personally. He \nhas deployed on five occasions to Iraq and Kuwait since 2005. The military has \ncommended him and noted that his equipment has helped save lives. Even his two ex-\nwives and the mother of one of his children wrote letters on his behalf. His wife noted \nhis beer drinking, but testified that she has not seen him drunk in 18 years. He has \nestablished a pattern of responsible use, but he is not completely abstinent. Clearly, \nApplicant would be better off if he completely quit drinking. However, he is indulging in a \nlegal act. His drinking does not cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol use. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. Applicant is a 29-year-old engineer employed with a Department of Defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer since September 2006. The highest degree awarded to her is a Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering. She is married and has a two-year-old daughter. She and her husband also have custody of her husband\u2019s nine-year-old niece. This is her first time applying for a security clearance. (Tr at 35, 55, Gov 1.) Applicant was born and raised in Colombia. In 1996, she met her husband in Colombia. He was born in Colombia but lives in the U.S. and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He was home visiting his parents who live in Colombia when he met Applicant. After two years of dating, they married in August 1998. After their marriage, her husband applied for her to immigrate to the U.S. She moved to the U.S. about seven months later. (Tr at 35, 44; Gov 1; Gov 2.) On July 4, 2005, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. She applied for a U.S. passport on July 29, 2005. Applicant possessed a Colombian passport which was issued on November 27, 1998 with an expiration date of November 27, 2008. (Gov 2.) She maintained her Colombian passport because she understood the Colombian government requires Colombian citizens to travel on their Colombian passport. Upon learning of the security concern related to possessing a foreign passport, Applicant renounced her Colombian citizenship on June 2",

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Robert Krug, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on January 30, 2007. On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 10, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 1, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2008. On August 15, 2008, a Notice \nof Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2008. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 3, which \nwere admitted without objection. The Government requested that administrative notice \nbe taken of one document with four attachments. The document was marked as \nOctober 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nHearing Exhibit 1 (Hearing Ex 1) without objection. Applicant testified, called three \nwitnesses, and submitted one exhibit which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on September 22, 2008. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nColumbia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy with a population of \napproximately 44.8 million. Dual U.S. \u2013 Colombian citizens must present a Colombian \npassport to enter and exit Colombia.   \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to \nColumbia because violence by narco-terrorist groups continues to affect some rural \nareas and cities.  While security in Colombia has improved significantly in recent years, \nterrorists and other criminal organizations continue to kidnap and hold persons of all \nnationalities and occupations for use as bargaining chips. The incidences of kidnapping \nin Colombia have diminished significantly from its peak at the beginning of this decade.  \n \nThe U.S. Secretary of State has designated three Columbian groups \u2013 the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), \nand the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations. These groups carried out bombings and other attacks in and around \nmajor urban areas, including against civilian targets. \n \nThe Columbian government\u2019s respect for human rights continued to improve. \nHowever, illegal armed groups and terrorist groups committed the majority of human \nrights violations \u2013 including political killings and kidnappings, forced disappearances, \ntorture, and other serious human rights abuses.  \n \nThe U.S. remained fully committed to supporting the Colombian government in \nits efforts to defeat Colombian-based Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The Colombian \ngovernment continues vigorous law enforcement, intelligence, military and economic \nmeasures against the FARC, ELN, and AUC. The Colombian government has also \nincreased its efforts with neighboring countries to thwart terrorist expansion, investigate \nterrorist activities inside and outside Colombia, seize assets, secure hostage release, \nand bring terrorists to justice. Colombia provided anti-terrorism training to nations in the \nregion. The government continues to seek enhanced regional counterterrorism \ncooperation to target terrorist safe havens in vulnerable border areas.  \n \nThe U.S. \u2013 Colombia extradition relationship remains the most successful such \neffort in the world.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old engineer employed with a Department of Defense \ncontractor.

(Tr at 35, 55, Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Colombia. In 1996, she met her husband in \nColombia. He was born in Colombia but lives in the U.S. and is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. He was home visiting his parents who live in Colombia when he met Applicant. \nAfter two years of dating, they married in August 1998. After their marriage, her \nhusband applied for her to immigrate to the U.S.  She moved to the U.S. about seven \nmonths later. (Tr at 35, 44; Gov 1; Gov 2.)  \n \nOn July 4, 2005, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. She applied for a U.S. \npassport on July 29, 2005. Applicant possessed a Colombian passport which was \nissued on November 27, 1998 with an expiration date of November 27, 2008. (Gov 2.) \nShe maintained her Colombian passport because she understood the Colombian \ngovernment requires Colombian citizens to travel on their Colombian passport. Upon \nlearning of the security concern related to possessing a foreign passport, Applicant \nrenounced her Colombian citizenship on June 27, 2008. She turned in her Colombian \npassport and her Colombian identity card in conjunction with her renunciation. (Tr at 35-\n36; Gov 2; Gov 3; AE A.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, and sister, are citizens of and reside in Colombia.  Her \nparents are retired. Prior to retiring, her mother performed administrative work for a \ngovernment agency. Her father was a teller in a bank.  Her sister is a registered nurse. \nHer sister\u2019s husband works for a government agency which deals with health care. \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are also citizens of and \nreside in Colombia. They live in the same town as Applicant\u2019s parents. There have been \nno incidents of terrorism where Applicant\u2019s family members reside. (Tr at 39, 43, 45-46.)  \n \nApplicant is close to her parents. She contacts them about four times a week,  \nusually via the Internet. She talks to her sister about every two weeks. Her parents do \nnot want to move to the U.S. Applicant intends to sponsor her sister, her sister\u2019s \nhusband and son to move to the U.S. (Tr at 41, 43, 50; Gov 2.) \n \nApplicant and her husband traveled to Colombia to visit family members in 1999, \n2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Her trips usually occurred during her college \nsemester breaks. Applicant used her Colombian passport each time she traveled \nbecause she was a Colombian citizen. She had become a U.S. citizen prior to her 2005 \nvisit, but Applicant understood that Colombia required her to travel using her Colombian \n\n \n4 \n \n \npassport. The last time Applicant traveled to Colombia to visit family members was in \nJuly 2008.  She and her husband did not travel in 2006 and 2007 because of her \ndaughter\u2019s young age. (Tr at 48-49; Gov 2; Gov 3.)  \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant and her husband purchased a townhome located in \nthe town where both of their parents reside. They purchased the home as a vacation \nproperty. The loan was obtained from a U.S. company. They will stay there when they \nvisit family members. Applicant\u2019s parents reside in the property year round. The \ntownhome is worth $45,000. Applicant and her husband pay $300 a month for the \nmortgage. Her parents pay for the utilities and routine maintenance. (Tr at 41, 46-48; \nGov 2.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual income is approximately $72,000. Her husband\u2019s annual \nincome is approximately $65,000.  In 2004, they purchased a home in the U.S. It is \nworth $150,000. Aside from the townhome in Colombia, Applicant and her husband \nhave no other investments outside the U.S. (Tr at 42, 56-57.) \n \n Applicant considers the U.S. her home. The U.S. is where she wants to raise her \nfamily. It is where she wants to retire. (Tr at 42.) \n \nThe Chief Technology Officer of Applicant\u2019s company testified on her behalf.  He \nmet Applicant in 2006 when she was a university student. His company recruits the best \nand brightest from the local university. He describes Applicant as \u201cintense, very \nenthusiastic, hard working, clever and a good mom.\u201d  He is not Applicant\u2019s direct \nsupervisor. He is involved in mentoring and problem solving.  He interacts weekly with \nmost of the engineers including Applicant. (Tr at 17-24.) \n \nA design engineer who is a co-worker of Applicant testified. He has known \nApplicant since they both attended undergraduate school. They worked for the same \nresearch professor. Applicant is highly motivated, smart and excited about learning. He \nrecalls she was very excited when she became a U.S. citizen. (Tr at 24-28.) \n \nAn engineer who works at the company where Applicant previously worked has \nknown her since 2000.  They met in college. He states that Applicant is a strong-willed \nintelligent person. She was happy when she became a U.S. citizen. (Tr at 30-33.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG &9:       \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.    \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)10(a) (exercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession of a current foreign passport); and FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or \nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen) apply. Applicant used \nher Colombian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen when traveling to Colombia in \n2005.    \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. The following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) apply: \n \nFP MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship) and FP MC \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated) apply. Applicant was unaware that \npossessing a foreign passport would be an issue related to her security clearance. In \nJune 2008, she renounced her Colombian citizenship and surrendered her Colombian \npassport and identification card to the Colombian consulate.  \n \nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns. Guideline C is found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(c) (contact with a family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncoercion) applies because Applicant\u2019s father, mother, sister and in-laws are citizens of \nand reside in Colombia. \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup or country by providing that information) applies for the same reason.  Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with her family members in Colombia create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween her obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and her desire to \nhelp her family members residing in Colombia.  \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation) applies with respect to \nthe townhome that Applicant and her husband own in Colombia. It can be considered a \nsubstantial property interest.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. The following Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.) applies. The Colombian government has a strong \nrelationship with the U.S. government. The threat within Colombia are the narco-terrorist \ngroups. The Colombian government has been proactive in preventing and defeating \nnarco-terrorism. Applicant states that her family members do not reside in an area of the \ncountry that has a terrorist presence. Her parents are retired. Her sister is a registered \nnurse. Her brother-in-law is in the healthcare career field. It is unlikely that Applicant will \nbe placed in a position of having to chose between the interests of her family members \nin Colombia and the interests of the U.S. based on the fact that her family members \nappear to be average citizens and do not have a high profile in the Colombian \ngovernment.  They reside in an area of the country where there is no presence of \nterrorist activity.    \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies.  While Applicant is close to her parents and sister, she has \nestablished a home in the U.S. with her husband. She has lived in the U.S. since 1999. \nShe attended college at a U.S. university. Her daughter was born here. She works for a \nU.S. company. Aside from her family members in Colombia, her significant personal \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand professional associates are located in the U.S.  After she retires, she plans to live in \nthe U.S. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual) applies.  Although \nApplicant and her husband own a townhome in Colombia, the majority of their assets \nare located in the U.S. They have no other foreign assets. Applicant\u2019s parents reside in \nthe townhome year round. Applicant\u2019s family stays in the townhome when they visit \nrelatives in Colombia. Although Applicant described the townhome as a vacation \nproperty for her family, the property is also used as a place for her retired parents to \nlive. The property interest in the townhome is not significant enough to result in a \nconflict for the Applicant.    \n   \nAfter weighing all of the evidence, including the witnesses\u2019 testimony,   \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, and observing her demeanor at hearing, I am convinced that she \nwould resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.  \n \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under \nForeign Influence.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-\neducated, and intelligent woman. She attended U.S. universities to obtain her \nundergraduate and Masters degrees. She has developed strong bonds in the U.S. \nWhile she has ties of affection to her parents, sister and in-laws, her immediate family, \nher husband and daughter, are citizens and reside in the U.S. The majority of their \nassets are located in the U.S. They intend to live and retire in the U.S. Her superiors \nand co-workers attest to her favorable character and work performance. After evaluating \n\n \n9 \n \n \nall of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has met her \nburden of mitigating the concerns raised under foreign influence and foreign preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJune 25, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 22,\n2007 (Government Exhibit 1).  On December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted Answers to the SOR on February 1, 2008, and March 3,\n2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on March 25, 2008.  I received the case assignment on April\n1, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 4, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on April 21, 2008.  The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf,\ncalled one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F, without objection.\nPursuant to her request, the record remained open until May 2, 2008, for the\nsubmission of additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G\non May 5, 2008, which was admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing on April 30, 2008.  The record closed on May 5, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48, married and has a high school diploma.  She has two older\nchildren, neither with her current husband.  She is employed by a defense contractor as\na Warehouse Specialist and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR, with the exception of 1.f.\nShe further submits that there are two duplicate debts referred to in the SOR (1.g. and\n1.k.; 1.h. and 1.i.).

A credit report dated March 1, 2007, shows a Federal tax lien in\nthe amount of $16,322.00 for tax years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. (Government\nExhibit 2 at 3.)  There is no evidence that this lien has been released or that this amount\nhas been paid.

She submitted evidence showing\nthat she has been paying the IRS an amount between $75.00 and $150.00 every month\nsince November 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and G at 4-6; Transcript at 41-56.)  The\nApplicant has requested a current statement from the IRS, but as of the time the record\nclosed she had not received it.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H at 4.)\n1.b.\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that she had\nsuccessfully paid off her State tax liability in 1999.

The available\ndocumentary evidence and the Applicant\u2019s testimony supports this statement.\nAccordingly, this subparagraph is found for the Applicant. \n1.l.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Merchants Credit Guide on\nan account placed for collection by Montgomery Ward in the amount of at least\n$1,863.00.  The Applicant has made no payments on this debt, and has no current\nintention to make payments on this debt.  (Transcript at 69.)\n1.m.\nThe Applicant admits that she was late in filing her Federal income tax\nreturns for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.  She further testified that all the returns have\nbeen filed, she is now timely on her income tax returns, and she submitted copies of her\n\n4\n1999, 2000 and 2001 returns.

She further testified that all the returns have\nbeen filed, she is now timely on her income tax returns, and she submitted copies of her\n1999, 2000 and 2001 returns.  (Id.)  This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.\nShe has talked with two consumer debt consolidation agencies and to a\nbankruptcy attorney, but has not made arrangements with any of these entities\nconcerning her past due indebtedness.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, and H at 4; Transcript\nat 59-60.)\nThe records indicate that the past due debts discussed above total $16,126.00.\nThis excludes subparagraph 1.a.  The current total that she owes the IRS for past due\nFederal taxes is not known. \nMitigation\nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor submitted a statement.  He described the Applicant as\na \u201cvery conscientious, reliable and loyal employee.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H at 7.)  She\nhas received personal recognition from the Armed Forces in relation to her employment.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG &18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG &19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG &19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant has over $16,000.00 in past due debts, not including a\n\n6\npotentially large Federal tax debt, which have been due and owing for several years.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b620(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily before 2000.  In addition, AG \u00b620(b) states that it\nmay be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . .  divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  However, the Applicant made no attempt\nto even begin to try to pay these debts voluntarily until just before the hearing.  This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.    \nThe Applicant has not done anything to pay any of her debts, other than her tax\ndebts.  Even there, she is uncertain as to how much she currently owes the IRS. Under\nthe particular facts of this case, I cannot find that the Applicant has initiated a good-faith\neffort to pay off her creditors.  Accordingly, AG \u00b620(d) is not applicable.  As stated under\nFindings of Fact, above, subparagraphs 1.b., 1.f., 1.i., and 1.k. are found for the\nApplicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, professional person who has made poor decisions concerning her\ndebts.  She has just now begun to resolve her debt situation.\nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all the Applicant\u2019s debts are paid - it is\nwhether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security\nclearance.  Given the Applicant\u2019s complete failure to begin to resolve these debts, I\n\n7\ncannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b62(a)(6).\nAccordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)); or that the likelihood of\nrecurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.i.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1k.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1m.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",
