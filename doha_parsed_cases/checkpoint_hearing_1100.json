(Government Exhibit 1.) On March 18, 2019, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H \n(Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on April 6, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non May 16, 2019. The case was assigned to me on May 17, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on June 10, 2019. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on July 29, 2019. The Government offered Government Exhibits \n1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A and B, which were also admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 7, 2019.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he works as a \ndirector supervising 55 people. He is single, and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree. He has worked \nfor his employer since 2006, and is seeking to retain national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance in connection with his work with the DoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSections12 and 13A; Applicant Exhibits A and B; Tr. 39.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a and 1.b under this \nparagraph. He denied allegation 1.c. \n \n \n1.a. Applicant used marijuana from two to five times a year from approximately \n2000, when he was in college, until approximately April 2018. He used marijuana after \nobtaining a security clearance in 2006. He stopped using marijuana after being \ninterviewed about his drug use by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM). Applicant stated that he used marijuana most recently in an attempt \nto relieve work-related stress. He also admitted that using marijuana over such a long \nperiod while being employed and holding a security clearance was a poor decision. \nApplicant stated that his marijuana use was not at work, and that his use had no impact \non his work. Finally, Applicant admitted that he knew his use of marijuana was illegal \nunder Federal law during the entirety of his use, and under state law during most of his \nuse. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23, and Exhibit 2; Tr. 20-25, 28-30, 32.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant purchased marijuana from a dispensary after such purchase \nbecame legal in his state. He stated that he was confused about the legality of such \npurchase under Federal law at the time he made it. Applicant testified that he only \npurchased marijuana this one time. This single purchase has no security significance. (Tr. \n30-31.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant denied that he intended to continue to use marijuana in the future. \nIn his interview with an OPM investigator on April 30, 2018, Applicant stated that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future. In his signed and notarized Answer Applicant \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nstated, \u201cI am retracting this previous response and formally declaring there will be no \nintended illegal use of a controlled substance (including marijuana) in the future.\u201d \n(Answer; Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 31, 40-42.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that nobody at his place of employment knew about his hearing. \nHe further testified that he did not tell them because he would have been embarrassed. \n(Tr. 38-39.) \n \n \nApplicant further testified that his employer has a drug-free workplace policy, \nincluding marijuana. He further testified that as a manager he has attended briefings \nabout what to do if he suspects one of his subordinates is using drugs at the workplace. \n(Tr. 28, 39.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of using illegal drugs. Applicant repeatedly used marijuana \nbetween 2000 and 2018. He used it while holding a security clearance from 2006 \nonwards. He only stopped using the drug after he was interviewed for a security \nclearance.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant had not used marijuana for over a year as of the date of the hearing. I \nam viewing his Answer as a signed statement of intent to abstain from drug involvement \nand substance misuse as defined in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). In determining whether sufficient time \nhas passed to demonstrate that he will not return to marijuana use in the future one has \nto look at the whole person. Applicant argued that marijuana was not an important part of \nhis life, yet he was a fairly consistent user of the drug for approximately 18 years. In \naddition, he felt it was an important part of his life that he was embarrassed about, and \nmade the decision not to tell anyone at work about his hearing or the reason for it. It is \nalso telling that he used marijuana during most of his employment while holding a security \nclearance, in violation of criminal law, and despite his company\u2019s drug-free workplace \npolicy. There is little to no evidence, other than his self-serving testimony, that he will not \nreturn to drug use in the future if granted national security eligibility. Applicant has not met \nhis burden of persuasion to mitigate concerns arising from his lengthy history of drug \ninvolvement at this time. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns resulting from his long-term drug involvement. His expressed \nembarrassment over telling his employer about his drug use shows that he continues to \nbe susceptible to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Overall, the record evidence \ncreates substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Apostol, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/24/2019 \n \n______________\nDecision \n______________\n \n \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased on the record in this case,1 I deny Applicant=s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \n \nOn 18 March 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) raising trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations.2 Applicant timely answered the SOR (Item 1) and requested a decision \nwithout hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The record in \n1Consisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-4, and Applicant=s Response to the FORM \n(Response). \n2DoD conducts trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed in Information Systems \nPositions pursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nthis case closed 23 May 2019, when Department Counsel stated no objection to \nApplicant=s Response to the FORM. DOHA assigned the case to me 3 June 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for SOR 1.e and 1.l-1.m, \nwhich she disputes. She is a 43-year-old payment records adjuster sponsored for a public \ntrust position by a defense contractor, for whom she has worked since October 2017. \nExcept for a brief period of unemployment from April-October 2016,3 she has been \ncontinuously employed since January 2005. She married her first husband in July 1995 \nand divorced him in June 2014. They had three children together: a son born in October \n1995, a daughter born in January 1998, and a son born in February 2003. She married \nher second husband in August 2014, and separated from him in March 2016. She has \nnot previously had a trustworthiness determination (Item 2). \n \nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (Items 2-4) establish, 22 delinquent \ndebts totaling over $64,000. Applicant admits all but about $1,700 in alleged debt. \nApplicant disclosed SOR debts 1.g-1.j, 1.m, and 1.r-1.v on her November 2017 \ntrustworthiness application (Item 2), totaling a little over $4,600. Of the ten debts she \nlisted, seven were medical bills, two were debts to a former employer, and one was a \ndelinquent utility bill that she stated she would pay within the next three months. Five of \nthe debts she disclosed, and four of the seven medical debts, were $200 or less. Two of \nthe medical bills were under $100. Yet, none of the bills were resolved between November \n2017 and the issuance of the SOR. \n \nIn addition to these debts, the SOR alleges eight delinquent education loans \ntotaling over $57,000, another delinquent utility bill, a delinquent credit card, a delinquent \ninsurance bill, and an additional bill from a former employer. \n \nApplicant=s Response submitted an April 2019 rehabilitation agreement from the \ncollection agent for the education loan authority, showing that the delinquent loan balance \non the eight loans had risen to over $69,000, and obligating Applicant to make nine $5.00 \nmonthly payments beginning in April 2019, if she agreed to the plan.4 The Response also \nincluded a partial, undated credit report purporting to show that Applicant had disputed \nseveral of the delinquent debts as claimed in her Answer. \n \nApplicant broadly ascribes her financial problems to a long divorce, becoming a \nsingle mother of three, losing her job, and not having insurance coverage for any of the \nmedical bills, some of which were related to her children. However, the record lacks \n                                                 \n3Applicant lost her job when the employer closed the location where she worked, and all the employees \nwere laid off. \n4When Applicant signed the agreement, the first payment had been due for two weeks, yet Applicant \nprovided no proof of payment from the collection agent, bank statement showing a withdrawal in the \nrequired amount, or a copy of the check used to make the payment. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nfactual support for these claims. Three of the debts fell delinquent before Applicant=s \ndivorce. Another six fell delinquent after she remarried and before she separated from \nher second husband. The education loans fell delinquent in February 2017, after she had \nobtained new employment. \n \nApplicant has not explained the time line of her financial journey, the reasons for \nher divorce and separation, or any provisions of the divorce decree obligating the ex-\nhusband to provide support for his minor children.5 Moreover, while Applicant=s Answer \nlists time lines for resolving many of the debts, ranging from 1-18 months, she provided \nno repayment agreements from the creditors, nor did she explain why no apparent action \nwas taken on her debts until after she received the SOR. \n \nApplicant provided no budget or personal financial statement indicating her \nfinancial situation. She has not documented any credit or financial counseling. She \nprovided no work or character references, or evidence of civic or community involvement. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person=s suitability for \naccess to sensitive information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is \nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case \ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial \nof eligibility for a public trust position. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence \nas a whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nTrustworthiness decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue an applicant=s public trust position. The Government must \nprove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case.  \nBecause no one has a right to a public trust position, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \n                                                 \n5For example, if her employer was closing Applicant=s work location, there was almost certainly some \nadvance notice, yet Applicant separated from her second husband on the eve of her layoff. Without knowing \nthe circumstances of her separation, I cannot assess whether the separation was reasonable, even if the \nlayoff was unavoidable. Similarly, there is no evidence of any efforts by Applicant to find new employment \nin the face of her impending layoff. When these events occurred, her children were not of tender years. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels deciding any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Between October 2012 and February \n2017, Applicant accumulated what is now over $76,000 in delinquent debt. She was \naware of at least $4,600 of the debt when she completed her trustworthiness application \nin November 2017. Yet, she has documented no action to address these debts until after \nshe received the SOR.7 And none of the debts, however small, have been paid. \n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations.  \ngiven that she has provided no details about her delinquent debts or the circumstances \nsurrounding them.8 While some of the debts may be due to circumstances beyond her \ncontrol, she did not deal with the debts responsibly under the circumstances.9  Applicant \nhas had no credit or financial counseling; she has documented no efforts to resolve her \ndebts before receiving the SOR.10 Moreover, she has obviously not engaged in a good-\nfaith effort to address her debts.11 Finally, she provided no work or character evidence \nwhich might support a whole-person assessment to overcome the trustworthiness \nconcerns raised by her conduct.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n11/14/2019 \nDecision \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 20, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal \nconduct), F (financial considerations), and G (alcohol consumption). Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on June 12, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel amended the SOR on an indeterminate date. \nThe amendment added an allegation under Guideline F and corrected two allegations \nunder Guideline E. Applicant responded to the amendment on July 28, 2019. The case \nwas assigned to me on August 2, 2019.  \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on October 29, 2019. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted \nwithout objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since March 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the \nfirst time. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 1984 and additional \ncredits but no post-graduate degree. He is divorced with one child. (Transcript (Tr.) at \n36-37, 50, 55-56; GE 1; AE A) \n \n  \nApplicant went through protracted divorce proceedings from 2011 until the \ndivorce was finalized in 2013. He stated that he \u201cwas under tremendous stress during \nthat time and . . . exercise[d] bad judgment.\u201d He was arrested in October 2013 and \ncharged with driving under the influence (DUI), with blood alcohol level above .15. He \npleaded nolo contendere to the charge. He was sentenced to $1,000 in fines plus \nadditional court costs, 50 hours of community service, and probation for one year. He \nwas required to attend a DUI school and a victim awareness program. He completed all \nthe terms of his probation. (Tr. at 25-26, 34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE \nA, C) \n \n \nApplicant attended outpatient substance abuse counseling from November 2013 \nthrough January 2014. He admitted during his intake assessment that he smoked \nmarijuana for relief from his chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia. He stated that he \nsmoked marijuana when he was in college, but then nothing until he turned 50. He \nstated that from age 50 to 52, he would smoke half a joint for relief from his \nfibromyalgia. Applicant was 52 years old when he completed the intake assessment. \nHis drug test at admission tested positive for THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. \nHe successfully completed the last of his 12 sessions at the end of January 2014. He \nwas diagnosed at intake and discharge with alcohol abuse and cannabis abuse. (Tr. at \n26, 31-32, 37-40; GE 6; AE A, C) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in July 2016 and charged with DUI, second offense. He \npleaded nolo contendere to the lesser charge of reckless driving involving alcohol. He \nwas sentenced to $919 in fines and court costs, 100 hours of community service, and \nprobation for one year. He completed all the terms of his probation in October 2018. (Tr. \nat 26-27; GE 1-3, 5; AE A, C) \n \n \nApplicant denies that he was intoxicated when he was arrested in July 2016. He \nasserted that he had one drink with dinner five hours before he drove. He attributed his \nerratic driving to a mechanical problem with his car. He refused to have his breath or \nblood tested because his previous attorney told him that the tests are inaccurate, and \nhe should refuse to submit to them if he is ever arrested again for DUI. (Tr. at 26-31, 43-\n44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A, C) \n \n \nApplicant attended outpatient substance abuse counseling as part of a DUI \nprogram from October 2016 through February 2017. He admitted on his intake \n\n \n3 \n \nassessment that he smoked marijuana about 20 times while he was in college. There is \nno mention of his more recent use. He remained abstinent during the program. He \nattended 8 individual sessions and 14 group sessions. He successfully completed the \nprogram with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, mild, which was later corrected to \nalcohol use disorder in sustained remission. (Tr. at 35-36, 41-42; GE 2, 7; AE A, C) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he has not used marijuana since before he started his \ncounseling in November 2013. He asserts that he has learned a costly lesson from his \nDUIs, and he has benefitted from his counseling. He assured that he only drinks \nresponsibly and that he will never drink and drive again. He signed a statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr. \nat 31-32, 40-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, C) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a $92,288 charged-off mortgage loan; $11,409 in unpaid \nfederal income taxes for tax year 2015; and 34 delinquent medical debts with balances \ntotaling about $12,150. Except as addressed below, the allegations are established \nthrough credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were adversely affected by his divorce, a lay-off from his job \nin 2014, and a serious medical operation in 2017. As part of his divorce, he was ordered \nto refinance the mortgage on his home to remove his ex-wife\u2019s name from the loan or \nsell the property, to include a short sale. He was unable to refinance the property, but \nthe creditor agreed to a short sale, which took place in 2016. There is no evidence that \nthe creditor has actively pursued any deficiency on the mortgage loan. (Tr. at 23-24; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 9, 10; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, C) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax liability for tax year 2015 was $37,912, but there \nwas only $1,658 withheld from his paycheck. He made payments totaling $2,000 in \n2016. The IRS withheld $7,424 from his 2016 refund and $8,420 from his 2017 refund. \nHe made payments totaling $400 in 2017. He paid $5,969 in March 2018 and \nestablished a $500 per month installment agreement. He maintained the payments and \nthe IRS withheld $5,139 from his 2018 refund. In June 2019, the IRS released the tax \nlien it had filed against him and indicated that the taxes owed for tax year 2015 had \nbeen satisfied. (Tr. at 22; GE 8; AE B, C) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s surgery in 2017 cost more than $228,000 in medical bills. He \ncontested the amount of the medical debts because his health insurance placed a \n$5,000 limit on his liability. He paid a number of the medical debts and referred other \ndebts to his attorney. He stated that he is willing to pay all the medical debts that are his \nresponsibility. His finances are otherwise in order. (Tr. at 22-25; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2, 9, 10; AE A, C) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nMarch 2018. He reported his two DUI arrests; his substance abuse counseling; and a \n$9,045 delinquent medical debt. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked if he \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years. He failed to \n\n \n4 \n \nreport his marijuana use between 2011 and November 2013. (GE 1) He denied \nintentionally providing false information about his marijuana use with the following \nexplanation. \n \nI truly believed at the time that my use was over 7 years earlier. During the \nintake into counseling, if I were informed that traces of Cannabis were \nfound in my system, I would have been more likely to remember the \ntimeframe. All I recalled, when answering the statement, was that \nsometime during my divorce which started 2010 and filed in 2011 (7 years \nearlier), I did on a few occasions exercise poor judgment and use \nCannabis. The 2011 date stuck in my mind and hence why my response \nwas such. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was consistent in that he asserted he thought his marijuana \nuse was beyond the seven-year window for the question. He stated that he was never \ninformed that he tested positive in November 2013 during his substance abuse \ncounseling, which if he had known might have sparked his memory when answering the \nquestion. He stated that \u201cknowing that it was that long ago. I gave myself the benefit of \nthe doubt.\u201d (Tr. at 32-35, 45-55) \n \n \nApplicant responded to Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \ninterrogatories in March 2019. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked if he \n\u201cEVER\u201d used any illegal drugs. He denied that the answer was intentionally false. He \nstated that he misread the question and assumed it was asking about the previous \nseven years, and he thought his marijuana use occurred more than seven years before \nhis response. (Tr. at 35, 46-47, 51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \n \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance over more than three decades. He stated that he has always been a \ntrustworthy employee and he hopes to be given the chance to prove that he is \ndeserving of a security clearance. (Tr. at 57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n6 \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a defaulted mortgage \nloan, unpaid taxes, and delinquent medical debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n\n \n7 \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were primarily related to his protracted divorce \nand his medical problems. His mortgage loan was resolved with a short sale, with no \nevidence that the creditor has actively pursued any deficiency on the mortgage loan. He \npaid his delinquent income taxes and is working to resolve his medical debts. Concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s financial problems are mitigated. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n\n \n8 \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s  \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant provided inaccurate information about his marijuana use on his SF 86 \nand in his response to DOHA interrogatories. He tested positive for THC, the active \ningredient in marijuana, during his admission for outpatient substance abuse counseling \nin November 2013, which was less than four and a half years before he submitted the \nSF 86 in March 2018. I did not find him credible, and I did not find his explanations that \nhe thought his marijuana use was outside the seven-year reporting window to be worthy \nof belief. After considering all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, education \nexperience, and motive to fabricate, I find by substantial evidence1 that he intentionally \nprovided false information about his marijuana use on the March 2018 SF 86 and in his \nMarch 2019 response to DOHA interrogatories. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) are applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use and two alcohol-related arrests reflect questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The conduct also \ncreated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) \nare applicable.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s two alcohol-related arrests as well as his \nfinancial issues. It is somewhat odd to allege both alcohol and financial concerns under \none personal conduct allegation. The alcohol-related arrests are discussed above and \nalso below under Guideline G. The financial issues are discussed above under \nGuideline F. Applicant\u2019s financial issues do not generate any personal conduct \nconcerns. The part of SOR \u00b6 3.a that alleges Applicant\u2019s financial issues is concluded \nfor Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges that Applicant was diagnosed with cannabis abuse during his \ntreatment in November 2013. That information might form the basis of a disqualifying \ncondition if it was alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse), \nbut it does not allege any personal conduct independent of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, \nwhich is already alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.b. SOR \u00b6 3.c is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n                                                          \n1 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal \nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than \na preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994); ISCR \nCase No. 04-07187 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006). \n\n \n9 \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant lied on the SF 86 and in his response to DOHA interrogatories. He has \nconsistently denied that he lied on the SF 86 and in his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. Having determined that he intentionally omitted information about his \nmarijuana use in an attempt to mislead the government, I have also determined that his \nexplanations that the omissions were unintentional were also false. It would be \ninconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.2 Had he been honest from the beginning, his \nmarijuana use and alcohol-related driving offenses might have been mitigated. \n                                                          \n2 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \n \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n\n \n10 \n \nHowever, without complete candor, there are no applicable mitigating conditions and \nnone of the conduct is mitigated.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \nApplicant had two alcohol-related driving offenses. He was diagnosed as part of \nhis outpatient substance abuse counseling in February 2017 with alcohol use disorder, \nmild, which was later corrected to alcohol use disorder in sustained remission. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n22(a) and 22(d) are applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n\n \n11 \n \nApplicant completed outpatient substance abuse counseling in January 2014. He \nhad another alcohol-related driving offense in July 2016. He completed his second \noutpatient substance abuse counseling in February 2017. His diagnosis of alcohol use \ndisorder in sustained remission indicates that he is on the right track. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and \n23(d) are applicable. However, concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment raised by his two alcohol-related criminal convictions are not mitigated \nunder the same rationale discussed above under Guideline E. AG \u00b6 23(a) is not \napplicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, F, and G in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. However, that is insufficient to overcome his \nnumerous incidents of questionable judgment and dishonesty. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not mitigate the \npersonal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.jj: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \npart \nof \nthe \nallegation \nthat \naddresses Applicant\u2019s finances, \nwhich is found For Applicant) \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.d-3.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He did not timely file his tax returns for tax years \n2014 through 2017, and his financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nAccess to classified information is denied.    \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 5, 2018, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On March 19, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). \nOn April 19, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) He requested a \nhearing. (HE 3) On May 30, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On June \n21, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On June 28, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 17, 2019. \n(HE 1)   \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant offered \nfour exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-\nAE D). On July 26, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.   \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (HE 3) He admitted \nthat he failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, \n2015, 2016, and 2017.

(AE C) Applicant said his 2015 federal income tax return was filed at \nthe same time as the other five federal income tax returns on June 11, 2019. (Tr. 24; AE \nC) He provided a copy of his 2015 state income tax return. Applicant is credited with \nmailing his 2015 federal income tax return to the IRS. \n \nFor tax years 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018, Applicant said he paid $2,455, $669, \n$159, and $3,935 when he filed his state tax returns. (Tr. 28; AE A at 3) Applicant\u2019s 2018 \nfederal and state tax returns were timely filed. (AE B; AE C) Applicant is credited with \npaying all of his state and federal income taxes.   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns . . . tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6 19(f).  \nSeven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n6 \n                                         \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \nApplicant had deaths, injuries, and serious illness in his family, including his \nsignificant other. These are circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his \nrecord collection and application of his time and energy to address his taxes.  However, \nthese circumstances are insufficiently detailed to prove he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nOn June 11, 2019, he filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, \n2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. His filings of tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2017 \nwere not timely. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a \nfederal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C, \n\u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \nNotwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when he filed his tax returns, the Appeal \nBoard provided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security \nclearance: \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies because he filed his tax returns and paid his required taxes; however, the timing \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nof the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. In ISCR Case No. 15-\n06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the grant of a security \nclearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nThere is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to file his federal \nand state tax returns on time. Under all the circumstances, including the jurisprudence \nfrom the DOHA Appeal Board, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 54 years old, and he is an information technology specialist. In 1991, \nhe received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in electronics engineering. Applicant has \nspecialized in network engineering since 1996, and he has worked on various contracts \nfor DOD and private entities.    \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. On \nJune 11, 2019, Applicant filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, \n2015, 2016, and 2017. His tax filings for those four years were not timely. When a tax \nissue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an applicant \nwaits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, and how \nlong the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making payments. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of \nsecurity clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for \nyears and then taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts \na determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary \ncompliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s \nsecrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of \na security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond \napplicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and \ngarnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nand pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant \nof a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. \nBd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired \nE-9 and cited his failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 \nand federal returns for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax \nreturns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment \nplan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted \nhis non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition \nand expenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized \n\u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well \nsettled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \nThe primary problem here is that Applicant has known that he needed to file his \nstate and federal income tax returns for several years. Even though he knew he was \ngoing to receive refunds or had sufficient funds to pay any taxes owed, he had a \nrequirement to timely file his tax returns. He did not fully understand or appreciate the \nimportance of timely filing of tax returns. He procrastinated. His actions in June 2019 are \ntoo little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future.  \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n_________________________\nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence. (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); dated July 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 26, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 31, 2019.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on July 29, 2019, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on August 21, 2019. The Government offered two \nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without \nobjection. The Applicant offered nine exhibits at the hearing, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nExhibits A through I, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his \nown behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 9, 2019. \n \n \n  \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe Peoples Republic of China (PRC).  Department Counsel provided an 11-page \nsummary of the facts, supported by 14 Government documents pertaining to China.  \nThe documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative \nnotice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. (HE-I) They are limited to \nmatters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the \nFindings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He is married with three children.  He has a Master\u2019s \ndegree in Mechanical Engineering, and a Master\u2019s degree in Business Administration, \nas well as several certifications.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D, E, F and G.)  He is employed \nwith a defense contractor as a Manufacturing Engineer Manager.  He is seeking to \nretain a security clearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \nApplicant was born in Hong Kong in 1965.  He grew up there and came to the \nUnited States as a teenager in February 1985.  He obtained his college education here \nand then his U.S. citizenship in 1991.  That same year he was hired by his current \nemployer and has been working for this defense contractor for the past 29 years.  \nApplicant has received numerous awards and accolades from his employer for his \ndedicated community and company outreach.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)  He has an \nimpeccable work history, as he has progressed over the years from an Engineer to the \nManager of Manufacturing Engineering.  Applicant has never applied for a security \nclearance before.  (Tr. p. 54.) \n \nApplicant is married to a naturalized American citizen and has three native-born \nAmerican children.  His only foreign contact with anyone in China is with his father-in-\nlaw, who is a retired middle school teacher.  He is 80 years old and his health situation \nis up and down.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law has no affiliation with the Chinese government \nor military.  Applicant\u2019s wife telephones her father in China about once a week to check \non him.  Applicant has almost zero contact with his father-in-law, as he only talks with \nhim when he travels to visit him in China.  Applicant last traveled to China in May 2019 \nand returned in June 2019.  During that trip he took his family, including his wife and \nchildren.  He has no plans for future travel to China.  (Tr. p. 57.) \n   \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law knows that he works for a U.S. company, but does not \nknow what kind of work Applicant does, and does not know that he works for a defense \ncontractor, or that he has applied for a security clearance.  (Tr. p. 58.)     \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he cannot be coerced into divulging any national \nsecurity secrets.  Applicant has never been approached, confronted, or contacted by \nany foreign entity attempting to obtain protected information.  He stated that if his father-\nin-law or anyone else in China or Hong Kong was detained by the Chinese government \nin an effort to extort protected information from the Applicant, he would immediately \nreport it to the U.S. authorities.  Applicant states that he is loyal to the U.S. and that his \nlimited relationships with any foreign member of Hong Kong or China cannot threaten \nhim to do anything against the interests of the United States.  (Tr. pp. 59 - 60.)   \n \nThree witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  Each of them know the \nApplicant from work, and have either supervised him at some point, or worked with him \nfor many years, or both.  They also participate with him in several professional social \ngroups within the company.  Applicant is described as \u201cdynamic,\u201d \u201chighly respected,\u201d \nand a \u201cleader.\u201d  Besides his outstanding work product, he is involved with the \nToastmasters Club, sponsored by the company, the Asian-Pacific Professional Network, \nand is the founder of a community Martial Arts Club.  Applicant is considered to be a \nloyal, responsible, and trustworthy individual.  He is highly recommended for a security \nclearance.  (Tr. pp. 28 - 48.)     \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from five professional colleagues of the Applicant \nattest to his outstanding character that demonstrates high morals, hardwork, \nresponsibility and trustworthiness that inspires others around him.  He is said to \nembrace the diversity in the workplace with an ability to work effectively and efficiently \nwith sound moral integrity and ethical principles at all times.  He is considered to be an \nexceptional individual and an excellent team player.  He is said to be a fully engaged \ncitizen of the U.S. and a strong technical leader in the defense industry.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A.) \n \n \nNotice \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).   Targeting and collection of US political, military, \neconomic, and technical information by foreign intelligence services continues \nunabated.  China is one of the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information \nand technology.  China\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other \nentities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China \nwho can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable \nmedia devices or e-mail.  Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent \nperpetrators of economic espionage.  Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological \nand economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and \npersistent threat to U.S. economic security.   The nature of the cyber threat will evolve \nwith continuing technological advances in the global information environment.  (HE I) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s has only one foreign family member, his father-in-law who is a \nresident and citizen of Hong Kong.  Applicant maintains some contact with him, \nalthough it is very limited.  However, Applicant\u2019s ties to his foreign father-in-law in Hong \nKong may pose a heightened security risk for the United States Government.  The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and two of them are applicable in this case.   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent  \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation \n \n \nFamily ties in a foreign country raises a prima facie security concern that \nrequired the applicant to \u201cpresent evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation \nsufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a  security clearance for him.\u201d  Thus, Applicant bears the \nburden to establish that his relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  In this case, Applicant carefully explains that his only family in \nChina is his father-in-law.  Applicant has no regular contact with him.  His father-in-law \nknows nothing about the Applicant\u2019s job or that he is applying for a security clearance.  \nTheir conversations are minimal, casual, and infrequent at best.  His father-in-law is not \naffiliated in any way with any foreign government.  Applicant has no other family \nmembers or friends or associates of any kind in Hong Kong.  It is recognized that \nApplicant is at a higher risk of being targeted for Chinese intelligence gathering since he \nworks for a defense contractor.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family ties are here in the United States.  His wife and three children \nare Americans.  He has made his permanent home here and is loyal and dedicated to \nthe American ways.  He has accomplished his educational goals, has excelled at work \nand has been promoted over the years, and has engaged in his community by reaching \nout to others.  He has lived the American dream.  Thus, it can be assumed that he will \ncontinue to place the interest of the U.S. paramount, and always protect the U.S. from \nany risk of terrorism, and/or any situation that could place the interests of the U.S. in \njeopardy.  Under the circumstances, Applicant has met this burden and has established \ntwo mitigating conditions set forth above under Guideline B.      \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is obviously an extraordinary individual who shows maturity, \nintelligence and good judgment, and mentors and inspires others at the company.  He \nperforms outstanding on his job, and has the endorsement of his supervisor and many \nother professional colleagues.  It is noted that while he was born in China, he is an \nAmerican by choice. With his American wife and three children as his closest familiar \nties, he has established his own life here in the United States.  No significant security \nrisk remains evident.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

National security \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nHistory of Case \nOn June 10, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 2, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). On April 26, \n2019, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a hearing (Answer). The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on June 27, \n2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 30, 2019, setting the hearing for August \n16, 2019. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and \n2 into evidence. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 26, \n2019.  \n \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Afghanistan. Applicant did not object to the \nrequest, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request that \nare supported by source documents from official U.S. Government publications attached \nto the request. (Tr. 14) The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general \nknowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. The pertinent facts are set out in the \nFindings of Fact below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the two allegations contained in the SOR. Her admissions are \nincorporated into these findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and was born in United States. She earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree from an American university. She married her husband in 2009. He was born in \nthe United States. They have three young children. She has worked for a defense \ncontractor since 2014. Prior to that, she stayed at home with her children for three to four \nyears. Applicant is active in community and school organizations. (Tr. 16-18, 21, 27-28; \nAE A) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Afghanistan. Her father immigrated to the United \nStates in 1969 and her mother in the early 1980s. They are naturalized U.S. citizens. \nThey met in Afghanistan and married in the United States. Applicant has a sister and a \nhalf-sister, both of whom were born in the United States. Her parents do not have any \nimmediate family members who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. All of them live \nin the United States. Applicant\u2019s mother has occasional contact with a distant relative in \nAfghanistan. Her parents do not receive any money from people living in Afghanistan. \nApplicant does not have contact with any family members in Afghanistan. She does not \nsend money to anyone residing there, nor does her husband. They do not receive money \nfrom people residing in Afghanistan. (Tr. 19, 23, 29, 32, 35-36) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s believes that her father returned to Afghanistan once after immigrating \nto the United States. She was a young child at the time. Her mother returned once when \nApplicant was in high school. Both parents know she is seeking a security clearance. (Tr. \n33)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were born in Afghanistan. They \nsubsequently immigrated to the United States. After her father-in-law divorced her \nmother-in-law, he returned to Afghanistan in 1988 when Applicant\u2019s husband was five \nyears old. Applicant remained with his mother in the United States. Applicant said she \nhas never met her father-in-law, but spoke to him once after she and her husband were \nmarried in the United States. She testified that her husband speaks to his father at most, \nonce a year. She said he played little or no role in her husband\u2019s upbringing and life. Her \nmother-in-law is a U.S. citizen and resident. She worked as a linguist for the U.S. Armed \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nForces in Afghanistan for a couple years. She is aware that Applicant is seeking a security \nclearance. (Tr. 24-25, 32-34, 36-37; GE 1, GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law served as a minister in a department of the Afghan \ngovernment. Applicant said she did not know that information about her father-in-law until \nshe received the SOR. She does not think he currently works in any capacity related to \nthe Afghan government or its military. (Tr. 25-26: GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s second cousin was a high-ranking member of the executive \nbranch of the Afghan government from 2004 to 2014. She has never met this cousin and \nhas no contact with him. Her husband does not have contact with him or any cousins in \nAfghanistan. He has contact with cousins residing in the United States. (Tr. 34, 38)   \n \n \n \nApplicant has never visited Afghanistan. (Tr. 21) Her husband worked for a \ndefense contractor in Afghanistan as an interpreter for the U.S. Armed Forces for a year \nbetween 2005 and 2006, which was prior to their marriage in 2009. At the time he worked \nthere, his father was a minister in the Afghan government and his second cousin was in \nthe executive branch. She believes her husband held a security clearance at that time. \nHer husband returned to Afghanistan once to visit family years ago. (Tr. 21-22, 31-32; GE \n1, GE 2)  \n \n \nApplicant and her husband purchased a $237,000 home in 2015, and have a \n$150,000 mortgage on the property. They have bank and retirement accounts in the \nUnited States. They have no property or financial interests in Afghanistan. (Tr. 18-19, 30)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from her manager and immediate \nfamily members. Her manager stated he has supervised Applicant since April 2014 and \nhas no knowledge that she maintains relationships or contacts with citizens or residents \nof Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s mother and half-sister confirm that Applicant has never met \nher husband\u2019s second cousin and has no contact with him or her father-in-law. All authors \nattest to her loyalty to the United States. (AE A) Throughout the hearing, Applicant \nasserted a strong commitment to the United States and its interests. (Tr. 45) \n \n \nAfghanistan \n \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npronouncements concerning the state of Afghanistan. Specifically, Afghanistan faces \nmany challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are \nincreasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, \nand the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be \navoided. Of particular significance are the poor human rights situation; the active and \nhostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and \nextremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military \nforces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests. (HE 3) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAfghanistan has internal factions that are openly hostile toward the United States \nand engage in extensive anti-western terrorism activities, contrary to U.S. interests. \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s connections to her husband\u2019s family in Afghanistan generate \nsignificant heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband has a relationship with his father, who is a citizen resident of \nAfghanistan and a former government official. His second cousin is a former government \nexecutive. These two relationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nexploitation, and a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and her desire to help her husband\u2019s relatives residing \nin Afghanistan. The evidence is sufficient to raise disqualifying security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant demonstrated that it is unlikely she could be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of an Afghan individual or government and those of the \nUnited States as a consequence of her husband\u2019s family ties there. She has never met \nher father-in-law and has spoken to him once by telephone in 2009, when she and her \nhusband were married. Her husband speaks to his father no more than once a year and \nnever speaks to his second cousin. She has never met or spoken to her husband\u2019s \nsecond cousin. The potential for a conflict of interest situation created by these family \nconnections is sufficiently mitigated. Accordingly, she established the mitigating \nconditions set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c).  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nThe evidence establishes full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key factor in the AG \u00b6 \n8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States.\u201d Applicant has strong connections to the United States. She was born here. \nHer immediate family members, including her husband, children, parents, and siblings \nare citizen residents of the United States. She graduated from U.S. schools and is active \nin many community organizations. All of her and her husband\u2019s financial and real property \nassets are in the United States. Additionally, her husband and mother-in-law assisted the \nU.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan during the most recent war there. All of these facts are \nin Applicant\u2019s favor and outweigh any familial connections she has in Afghanistan through \nher spouse. Applicant\u2019s U.S. ties are deep and longstanding such that she can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interests related to her husband\u2019s father or second \ncousin in Afghanistan, in favor of the U.S. interests.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B and in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe foreign influence security concerns do not arise from any questionable \nconduct by Applicant, but rather from circumstances that are normal results of family \nsituations. There is no evidence that she has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States, or that her husband\u2019s father or second cousin poses \na potential risk to the United States. There is credible evidence that her husband and \nmother-in-law are loyal U.S. citizens and residents, as demonstrated by their work as \nlinguists for the United States during the recent war there. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts and circumstances in the context of the \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nwhole-person, Applicant fully mitigated the substantial security concerns pertaining to \nforeign influence.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is granted \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or \nafter June 8, 2017. In an April 12, 2019, response, he admitted or partially admitted six of \n11 allegations under Guideline F, both allegations under Guideline E, and also  requested \na determination based on the written record. On May 8, 2019, the Government issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) with seven attachments (\u201cItems\u201d). I was assigned the \ncase on June 14, 2019. Based on my review of the record, I find Applicant mitigated \nGuideline E security concerns, but failed to mitigate Guideline F security concerns. \n  Findings of Fact \nApplicant is a 29-year-old contractor who has completed some college. He \nexperienced periods of unemployment from September 2017 to April 2018, June 2017 to \nAugust 2017, and, during periods when he was attending college intermittently, from April \n2008 to December 2014. At some point during these periods of unemployment, during a \n07/03/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \ntime Applicant emphasized was in his youth and during a time he could not make all \npayments on his accounts due to \u201ccircumstances beyond his control,\u201d he initiated a \nvoluntary repossession of his vehicle to reduce his monthly obligations. (SOR Response \nat 5) Applicant is single and the father of a nine-year-old child. He is enrolled in a credit \nrepair program to aid in restoring his credit.  \n \nIn April 2018, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). On the \nSCA, he answered \u201cno\u201d in response to Section 22, which inquired whether he had ever \nbeen charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs despite a March 2009 arrest for \ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He answered in the negative because he \nbelieved the DUI would be removed from his record when he completed his probation.  \n \nApplicant also answered \u201cno\u201d in response to Section 26, which inquired whether \nhe had any bills or debts which had been turned over to a collection agency or had any \naccounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failure to pay in the \npreceding seven years. In his SOR Response, Applicant noted \u201c(t)wo of these instances \noccurred due to my not being with a job. The other accounts were situations that I did not \nknow of, and situations where I was accused of things that did not happen. Most of these \naccounts were disputed.\u201d Since learning of all of the accounts at issue, Applicant has \n\u201cmade a good faith effort to be fully transparent with this reviewing body.\u201d (SOR Response \nat 7).   \n \nAt issue in the SOR are 11 delinquent debts, amounting to approximately $41,600. \nApplicant fully admits those noted at 1.f (charged off account; $568) and 1.g (charged off \nauto-related account; $21,313), attributing their delinquency to his periods of \nunemployment. He partially admitted the delinquent student loan debts noted in the SOR \nat 1.a-1.d (totaling about $17,600), noting that he had been previously unaware that the \naccounts had been turned over for collection due to their delinquency status. (SOR \nResponse at 3-4)  \n \nOf the remaining five accounts at issue in the SOR, Applicant noted: \n \n1.e \u2013 Medical balance of $424 \u2013 Applicant denied liability for this account, noting \nthat he had medical insurance at the time and was never made aware of any balance \nowed. \n \n1.h \u2013 Collection for telecommunications entity balance of $197 \u2013 Applicant denied \nknowledge of this debt. \n \n1.i \u2013 Collection for apartment rental entity balance of $967 -  Applicant wrote, \u201cI left \nmy apartment in good standing. There was a dispute with the rental company regarding \na broken set of blinds. I disputed this claim and the account was settled.\u201d (SOR Response \nat 5) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \n1.j \u2013 Medical balance of $79 \u2013 Applicant denied liability for this debt, noting that he \nwas fully covered by medical insurance at the time and was not made aware of a balance \nowed.  \n \n1.k \u2013 Collection account balance of $486 \u2013 Applicant denied liability for this \naccount, noting that \u201cduring the time I conducted business with this company they \nswitched to a new management company. The new company accused me of missing a \npayment which I disputed and the charged was removed.\u201d (SOR Response at 5) \n \nIn the FORM, the Government was noted that Applicant failed to provide \ndocumentary evidence reflecting action taken on the accounts at issue in the SOR, \nincluding settlements, payments, or disputes. In his FORM Response, Applicant included \nmultiple pages issued by his credit repair entity reflecting that many accounts had been \ndeleted from his credit report after dispute. The disputed and deleted accounts include \nthe names of some of the entities at issue in the SOR \u2013 such as the accounts noted at \nSOR both 1.f and 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k - but do not reflect account numbers, balances, or \nother information that might help identify and link the referenced accounts in the credit \nrepair effort\u2019s papers with the actual accounts in the SOR. (For example, one entity cited \nin the credit repair company\u2019s papers is noted in the SOR at both allegations 1.f and 1.g, \nbut it is unclear whether the disputed account is for the debt at 1.f for $561 or the debt at \n1.g for over $21,000.) That documentation also fails to identify the reasoning behind both \nthe disputes and deletions. It is equally impossible to tell which of the over 10 student \nloans referenced in the credit repair paperwork are the same as the four of interest in the \nSOR.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. This process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Any doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of national security. Under the Directive, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence that transcends duty \nhours. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately \nor inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions shall be in terms \nof the national interest and are in no sense a determination as to an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGUIDELINE F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth the security concern that failure or inability \nto live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, Applicant admitted or partially admitted over half of the delinquent accounts \nset forth in the SOR, thus acknowledging almost all of the actual delinquent debt at issue. \nThose admitted or partially admitted allegations include over $17,000 in student loans \nand nearly $22,000 in charged-off accounts. Such facts are sufficient to invoke the \nfollowing financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFive conditions could mitigate the financial security concerns posed:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his debts, in part, to his inexperience and \u201ccircumstances \nbeyond his control.\u201d Assuming the circumstances beyond his control were related to one \nor more of his three periods of unemployment. At one point, he initiated a voluntary \nrepossession of a vehicle to reduce his monthly obligations. While this singular act \ndemonstrates minimal effort by Applicant under the circumstances, especially in the \nabsence of documentation reflecting efforts to contact his creditors during his times of \nfinancial distress, it is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b) in part. \n \nOtherwise, the debts at issue were created by less than extraordinary \ncircumstances. They remained virtually unaddressed until after the SOR was issued. \nWhile he has retained the services of a credit repair entity, there is no indication he has \nreceived financial counseling. The credit repair entity has apparently conducted a blanket \ndispute of Applicant\u2019s credit report entries. While this apparently has led to some \ndeletions, the documentation offered inadequately identifies most of the accounts \ndisputed for linking to those accounts at issue in the SOR. Consequently, the degree to \nwhich Applicant\u2019s accounts are being resolved or are now under control remains unclear. \nBecause of the success of several disputes of credit report entries, however, I find AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies in part. \n \nGUIDELINE E, Personal Conduct \n \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nHere, Applicant denied having ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol \nor drugs, neglecting to note his 2009 DUI. He also failed to identify debts or bills turned \nover to collection in the preceding seven years, or having has an account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed within the same time \nframed. Purposefully inaccurate or false answers on any of these documents would raise \nAG \u00b6 16(a) and AG \u00b6 16(c).   \n \n \nBy way of explanation, Applicant wrote that he failed to disclose his DUI because \nhe did a poor job in reading the question. He stressed that he believed the DUI would be \nremoved from his record after he completed probation. While candor and good judgment \nshould have resulted in disclosure of the DUI arrest and charge, at a minimum, he was \n18 at the time and may not have understood his situation fully. Without more indications \nthat his omission was purposefully committed to falsify or mislead, it cannot be said to \nhave been intentional.  \n \n \nWith regard to not disclosing all his delinquent debts, Applicant wrote that two of \nthe debts at issue arose because of his periods of unemployment. He then noted other \naccounts were previously unknown to him before he received the SOR. As written, it is \nunclear whether he purposefully concealed the existence of the two delinquent debts he \nnoted were the result of his unemployment. Regardless, there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude his omissions were the result of fraud or an intent to conceal. Guideline E \nsecurity concerns are not established.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nadjudicative process factors listed in the AG. Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the need to utilize a \u201cwhole-\nperson\u201d evaluation is set forth. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated \nmy comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old contractor who experienced periods of unemployment \nbetween his college years and April 2018. With insufficient income, bills went unpaid and \ndelinquent accounts were forgotten or otherwise neglected. Although Applicant has relied \non counsel in preparing his case and on a credit repair entity for disputing his credit report \nentries, the documentation provided inadequately identifies the accounts disputed in such \na way that they cannot be clearly matched with the delinquent accounts at issue in the \nSOR. A clear link through identifying information such as account numbers or balances, \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \npreferably along with some helpful narrative, is needed to sufficiently show that the \ndelinquent accounts at issue have been addressed.  \n \nTo his credit, Applicant provided sufficient information to refute allegations that he \nintentionally provided false or misleading information on his SCA. Due to the insufficient \ndocumentary evidence provided regarding the delinquent debts at issue, however, \nfinancial considerations security concerns are sustained. I find that Applicant failed to \nmitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \nArthur E.

Applicant responded to the SOR on June 5, \n2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned \nto me on July 16, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on August 6, 2019.  \n \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 3 through 7 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

He has worked for \nhis current employer in two states since February 2018. He is married for the second \ntime with a stepchild. (Tr. at 27, 30, 48; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009 and a master\u2019s degree from the \nsame university in the same field of study in 2010.

He was required to pay at least nine \nmonthly payments of $5, after which the loans would come out of default and be \nreturned to the student loan servicing company. Applicant completed the $5 payments \nin March 2019. In December 2018, $232,598 ($189,599 in principal and $42,946 in \ninterest) was transferred to a student loan servicing company. Applicant made $449 \npayments in April and May 2019. He was accepted into an income-based repayment \nplan. If he remains in the plan, any balance owed on his student loans will be forgiven \nafter 25 years. The July 2019 credit report lists that Applicant is current with his $449 \nmonthly payments.

He spoke with a vice president at \nthe bank, who advised him that there was no means to rehabilitate the loan, and he \nshould dispute it through the credit reporting agencies. Applicant spent about 11 hours \non the phone unsuccessfully attempting to locate who if anyone currently owns the loan, \nbut the student loan servicing company informed him that they had no record of him or \nhis loan. The loan is reported by all three credit reporting agencies on the May 2018 \ncombined credit report and on the January 2019 Equifax credit report as charged off \nwith an amount of $25,229 and a $0 balance. It is reported on the June 2019 Experian \ncredit report as \u201cPaid, was a charge off,\u201d with a $0 balance. It is not listed on the July \n2019 Equifax credit report.

(Tr. at 23-25, 31, 48-50; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE A, D) \n \n \nApplicant provides his wife about $250 to $350 per month in support. His family \nhas a history of military service. A childhood illness prevented Applicant from serving, \nbut he feels that he is helping through his job. He credibly testified that that his family in \nthe Philippines could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation. (Tr. at 23-25, 41, 56, 66; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR)  \n \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his strong moral character and excellent \njob performance. He is praised for his trustworthiness, reliability, honesty, dedication, \nwork ethic, and integrity. (AE B) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n4 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n5 \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \ndefaulted student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant is a well-educated man who was unable to find a job in his chosen \nprofession. He was able to find work in several foreign countries teaching English, but \nhe did not earn a large income. He finally found a good job with a defense contractor in \nFebruary 2018. He was able to transfer within the company from an expensive area of \nthe country to an area where the cost of living is much less. He bought a house in \nanticipation of the immigration of his wife and stepson. He paid or settled all of the debts \nthat were not student loans. He rehabilitated his Department of Education student loans, \n\n \n6 \n \nand he is current on his $449 per month income-based repayment plan. His student \nloan debt is huge, but if he remains in the plan, any balance owed on his student loans \nwill be forgiven after 25 years. He has incentive to remain in the plan, as default could \nmean that he would have to pay the full amount, and could lead to the loss of his \nsecurity clearance and job. I am satisfied that he has made every effort to resolve the \nremaining private student loan, and that he would make payments if a creditor would \nacknowledge the loan and accept payments. \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to address all his debts. \nThere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved and is under control. I find \nthat he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant action to \nimplement that plan. His financial difficulties were the result of conditions that were \nbeyond his control, and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. They do not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and \n20(d) are applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) are partially applicable. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nthe Philippines. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to the Philippines. Guideline B is not \nlimited to countries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of \nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen from a patriotic family with a history of military \nservice. His wife\u2019s family in the Philippines fish and farm for a living. I find that \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the Philippines are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. I find that it is unlikely Applicant will be \n\n \n8 \n \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and \nthe interests of the Philippines. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and \n8(b) are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence and financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 15, 2019 SOR, Applicant owed a charged-off loan of $18,071 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); two charged-off credit-card debts of $823 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $517 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a charged-off credit union debt of $598 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); past-due medical debts of $1,275 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $56 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); and six collection debts totaling $5,127 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c, 1.h-1.i, and 1.k-1.l).

Applicant was divorced in August 2012 after almost eight years of marriage. He has no children. He reports that he was homeless or lived with family members between July 2007 and June 2008, and that he lived with his parents from October 2010 to February 2013, so he and his ex-wife may have been separated well before their divorce, although it is unclear.

He provided no evidence of any payments toward delinquent balances totaling \nmore than $26,000. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nOn April 15, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record without a hearing by an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On April 26, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of five exhibits (Items 1-5). DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on April 29, 2019, and instructed him to \nrespond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on May 2, 2019. No \nresponse to the FORM was received by the June 1, 2019 deadline. On July 9, 2019, the \ncase was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case \nfile on July 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 15, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed a charged-off loan of $18,071 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); two charged-off credit-card debts of $823 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $517 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a charged-off credit union debt of $598 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); \npast-due medical debts of $1,275 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $56 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); and six collection \ndebts totaling $5,127 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c, 1.h-1.i, and 1.k-1.l). (Item 1.) When Applicant \nresponded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the debts, which he attributed to his \nseparation and divorce. He had to move and without his ex-wife\u2019s assistance, he could not \nmake his payments. He added that he was \u201cslowly working on getting everything back in \norder.\u201d (Item 2.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the \nSOR, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old defense-contractor employee seeking a DOD security \nclearance. He has been working for his current employer as a designer since February \n2017. Applicant was divorced in August 2012 after almost eight years of marriage. He has \nno children. He reports that he was homeless or lived with family members between July \n2007 and June 2008, and that he lived with his parents from October 2010 to February \n2013, so he and his ex-wife may have been separated well before their divorce, although it \nis unclear. (Item 3.) \n \nApplicant worked as an automobile technician at a quick oil and lubrication facility \nfrom January 2007 to January 2008. While employed as a salesman at a car dealership \nfrom January 2008 to March 2009, he began studies toward a career change.  Applicant \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in June 2014 from a technical institute, which he attended \nfrom 2008 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014. (Item 3.) He obtained student loans of more than \n$26,000 between January 2009 and November 2010 and more than $16,000 between July \n2013 and February 2014. (Item 5.) \n \nApplicant worked while he was in school and during a break from his studies. He lost \nhis job at the car dealership when the business closed, and then worked in operations \nsupport for a plastics company from March 2009 until November 2011, when he was laid \noff. He spent the next two years as a forklift operator. In November 2013, Applicant \nsecured a job in his career field of graphic design, and he worked full time as an \nengineering technician, staying on after he earned his degree until February 2017, when he \n\n3 \n \nrelocated for his defense-contractor job. Apparently, his current employer gave him a job \noffer that he could not pass up. (Item 3.) The evidentiary record provided for my review \ncontains no income information for Applicant in his previous or present employments.   \n \nApplicant defaulted on some consumer credit debts after his divorce. A joint car loan \nobtained for $18,789 in May 2014, after his divorce, was charged off for $18,539 in \nSeptember 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A $2,548 balance owed to another creditor was placed for \ncollection in December 2016 due to inactivity since August 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). A $1,752 \nwireless-phone debt from March 2014 was referred for collection in March 2017 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). In November 2014, a credit union charged off a $598 deposit-related debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f). A credit-card account opened in August 2014 with a $300 credit limit was charged off \nfor $517 in November 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He obtained a second credit card with the same \nlender in February 2016 with a $700 credit limit. In August 2016, that account was charged \noff for $823 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Three medical debts from 2015, of $1,265 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $56 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j) and $62 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), were referred for collection. Applicant made timely \npayments of $469 per month on a car loan of $21,499 obtained in November 2014 with the \nexception of December 2016, when he fell behind 30 days. In April 2016, he took on a \nsecond car loan, of $30,135, to be repaid at $475 per month. He made those car payments \non time. (Item 5.) He provided no information about why he needed another vehicle. \n \nWhen Applicant relocated for his job in 2017, he owed $94 on his power bill for his \nprevious residence. The debt was placed for collection in June 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). In his \nnew locale, he bought home furnishings on credit for $1,267. He made his $84 monthly \npayments on time, but his old delinquencies went unpaid, and a $318 medical debt went to \ncollections in April 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). (Item 5.) \n \nOn December 8, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to the \nfollowing financial inquiry: \u201cIn the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to \na collection agency.\u201d He disclosed a $1,700 wireless-telephone debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), stating, \u201cWas on a joint account and people didn\u2019t pay [their] bill,\u201d and a $353 cable bill \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), stating, \u201cWhen I moved service was canceled but I still received [another] bill I \nwas aware of.\u201d He also responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he had \nany account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failure to make \npayments in the last seven years, and listed a credit card in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g) for \napproximately $2,500. He indicated that he was saving up money to pay the debts.  (Item \n3.) \n \nAs of February 3, 2018, Applicant had made no progress toward resolving his \ndelinquent debts. His student-loan debt had reportedly accrued to $58,641. His student \nloans were rated as current, although it is unclear whether one or all of his loans were \nbeing repaid or were in deferment. (Item 5.) \n \nAs of February 2019, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed that he was making payments \non three car loans: his April 2016 car loan (balance $19,758), which had been late 30 days \nin November 2018; his November 2014 vehicle loan (balance $10,101), which had been \n\n4 \n \ncurrent since January 2017; and a new loan obtained in January 2019 for $24,948, to be \nrepaid at $651 per month. His furniture account opened in April 2017 was $159 past due \non a balance of $1,171. He had made no progress toward resolving those of his old \ndelinquencies that were still on his credit record (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). The collection debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l were no longer on his credit record, but no payments for those debts \nare in evidence. Applicant had refinanced some of his student loans through a \nconsolidated loan of $36,941 in January 2018. He was making timely payments on six \ncredit cards, which had been opened since December 2017. The six accounts had a \ncombined balance of $3,182. (Item 4.) \n \nThere is no evidence of any efforts on Applicant\u2019s part to address the delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR. He attributes his financial problems to his divorce (Item 2), but \nthe debts at issue became delinquent when he was gainfully employed, years after his \ndivorce. He has taken on new debts as his past-due debts remain unresolved. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n5 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAvailable credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the delinquencies in \nthe SOR. As of March 15, 2019, he owed approximately $26,467 in charged-off or \ncollection balances. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \n\n6 \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing mitigation. One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. The cell phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c and the credit union \ndeposit-related debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f became delinquent in 2014. The car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nthe collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.j and 1.l are from \n2015. None of these debts were incurred recently, but they were not resolved as of the \nMarch 2019 SOR. The debts are considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his divorce and being unable to pay \nsome of his financial obligations on his income alone. Marital separation and divorce are \ncircumstances that could trigger AG \u00b6 20(b). Yet Applicant did not establish a connection \nbetween his divorce, which was final in 2012, and his debts, which became seriously \ndelinquent in 2014 or later. The debts in the SOR were charged off or placed for collection \nwhen Applicant was employed full time as an engineering technician. He rented an \napartment at that time, but with no details about his income or monthly expenses, it is \ndifficult to conclude that he exercised sound financial judgment under the circumstances \nthat existed at the time. \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained \n\n7 \n \ncontact with his creditors. Applicant listed the credit-card collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, the \nwireless-phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and the cable-services debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h on his \nDecember 2017 e-QIP, so he has known about those debts for some time. The \ndelinquencies are still outstanding with no evidence of any efforts on his part to resolve \nthem. He indicated in response to the SOR that he was \u201cslowly working on getting \neverything back in order.\u201d Two medical debts and a power bill in collection are under $100, \nand there is no evidence that he has acted responsibly to address even these debts. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d), the Appeal Board has held that an applicant is \nnot required to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first \ndebts paid be those in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThe Appeal Board recently reiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) \nthat \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \nApplicant has demonstrated that he can handle some financial accounts responsibly, as \nshown by his timely payments on several credit-card accounts and car loans. However, \nneither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) can reasonably apply without some progress toward \nresolving his old delinquencies. He has continued to take on new credit-card debts and \nauto loans while ignoring his past-due debts. His February 2019 credit report lists three \nopen vehicle loans with outstanding balances totaling $55,098. His monthly payment \nobligation on those loans exceeds $1,500. Applicant has not disputed the accuracy of the \ninformation listed on his credit report. He offered no explanation that could possibly justify \ntaking on a new car loan of $25,239 in January 2019 when he already had car payments \ntotaling $944 a month and when his delinquencies exceeding $26,000 remain ignored. Too \nmany unanswered questions exist about his present financial situation. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not sufficiently mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline F, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant went through some difficult circumstances \nwith his divorce, a period of homelessness, and likely low income before finding a job in his \nchosen career field. He is credited with obtaining his associate\u2019s degree to improve his job \n\n8 \n \nprospects. His current employer apparently offered him a job too good to refuse, and he \nmay have had some moving expenses associated with his relocation in February or March \n2017 for his job. He indicates that it has taken him a couple of years to regain his financial \nfooting. Even so, the record evidence shows some recent financial irresponsibility on his \npart. He has taken on new credit debt while continuing to ignore longstanding, delinquent \nfinancial obligations. Security clearance decisions are not intended as punishment for past \nspecific conduct. The security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful \nevaluation of an applicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, \nself-control, and other characteristics essential to protecting national security information. \nApplicant presented little information to overcome the security concerns. It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 27, 2017. On \nMarch 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive \n4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 7, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 1, 2019, and the \ncase was assigned to me on July 23, 2019. On August 6, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nAugust 26, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and presented \nthe testimony of one witness. He did not submit any documentary evidence. I kept the \n\n \n2 \n \nrecord open until September 27, 2019, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. \nHe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old refueler and outside machinist employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2017. He has never held a security clearance. \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2010. He was employed as the dean \nof students at a public school from September 2010 to August 2014. He moved from \nanother state to his state of current residence to be nearer to a woman who became his \ncohabitant and to seek a better-paying job. He found employment as a mathematics \nteacher in a public school in June 2014. He bought a home in March 2016. (Tr. 55-56.) \nHis cohabitant was not employed, and Applicant paid her medical bills, car payments, \nand her other \u201cneeds,\u201d which he did not define. His provisional teaching certificate expired \nin 2017, and he failed the test for recertification. He was unemployed from June 2017 \nuntil he was hired for his current job. He fell behind on his payments during his \nunemployment. (Tr. 61.) He lost about $200 in wages while visiting his seriously ill father. \n(Tr. 71.) He broke up with his cohabitant around June 2018 (Tr. 61.)  \n \n \nIn October 2018, Applicant was questioned about his delinquent debts by a \nsecurity investigator. (GX 2.) He hired a credit counselor in March 2019. It is not clear \nfrom the record whether he hired the credit counselor before or after the SOR was issued \non March 13, 2019, but he attached documents from his credit counselor to his answer \nto the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit counselor testified that she has been in business for 26 years \nand has about 600 clients. (Tr. 19, 26.) She testified that she is in the process of being \ncertified by the state as a credit counselor. (Tr. 36.) She is the sole member of her \ncompany. (Tr. 45.) She testified that she prepared a budget for Applicant, reviewed his \nfinancial situation, and was in the process of negotiating with creditors. She anticipated \nthat a financial plan for Applicant would be completed by December 2019. (Tr. 20.) She \ncharges $287.50 as a retainer fee and an $80 application fee. Applicant will pay $50 every \ntwo weeks until his financial goals are met. The fees are for her services and are not \napplied to Applicant\u2019s debts. (Tr. 25.) As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not yet \nstarted paying the fees. (Tr. 27.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent consumer debts totaling about $20,964, which \nare reflected in credit reports from February 2019 and January 2018. (GX 3 and 4.) The \nevidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: unsecured loan charged off for $9,735 in January 2017. Applicant \nincurred this debt to install a new heating and cooling system in his home. He knew the \nsystem needed to be replaced when he bought the home. (Tr. 66.) His payments were \n$150 per month. He stopped making payments in 2017, when he became unemployed. \nHe did not contact the creditor or make any efforts to resolve this debt. (GX 2 at 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s credit counselor testified that she had contacted the creditor and that they \nagreed to send her a written offer, but she had not received it as of the date of the hearing. \n(Tr. 27-29.) After the hearing, Applicant\u2019s credit counselor submitted a status report \nreciting that the creditor had insisted on full payment and Applicant had agreed to make \nmonthly $300 payments until a lower settlement amount is offered. (AX A.) Applicant \nsubmitted no evidence of payments under this agreement. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: collection account for $4,836, opened in September 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s credit counselor testified that she had disputed the amount of the debt and \nthat the collection agency was willing settle for 25% of the amount. (Tr. 29.) She testified \nthat this debt is for homeowners\u2019 association fees. (Tr. 30.) However, her status report \nindicates that the original creditor is an electronics and appliance store. The credit \ncounselor testified that she had received a written settlement offer, and that she \nanticipated that the debt would be settled by September 15, 2019. (Tr. 31-32.) Her status \nreport reflects that the collection agency had agreed to accept monthly $100 payments \nbeginning in October 2019.   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $2,579 in May 2017. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit counselor testified that she was trying to negotiate a settlement but had not received \na written offer. (Tr. 33.) Her status report recites that the creditor agreed to settle the debt \nfor $515 and that Applicant agreed to make a $100 payment and pay the balance within \n30 days. Applicant submitted no evidence of any payments under this agreement.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: charge account charged off for $2,174 in August 2016. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit counselor testified that she disputed the amount of the debt. She testified that, in \nMarch 2019, she offered to pay $1,000 in three installments, but she had not received a \nresponse as of the date of the hearing. (Tr. 36-37.) Her status report recites that the \ncreditor agreed to settle the debt for $869, with monthly $75 payments beginning in \nOctober 2019.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g: telecommunications debts placed for collection of $426 \nin August 2017 and charged off for $300 in May 2016. Applicant\u2019s credit counselor \ntestified that these accounts are duplicates. She testified that this creditor has offered to \nsettle the debts for $175, but she had not received the offer in writing. (Tr. 39.) Her status \nreport recites that both debts were disputed, one debt was deleted from the credit record, \nand the other is under investigation. Only one $300 debt to this creditor is reflected in the \nFebruary 2019 credit report. (GX 3.) Applicant submitted no evidence of payments on the \n$300 debt. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: charge account charged off for $335 in May 2016. Applicant\u2019s credit \ncounselor testified that she asked the creditor to remove some of the late fees included \n\n \n4 \n \nin this debt, but she did not recommend settling this account because it would preclude \nApplicant from obtaining another account with this creditor. (Tr. 42.) The status report \nrecites that this debt is no longer collectable under local law and will be deleted from \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports. Applicant has made no payments on this debt. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: telecommunications account placed for collection of $579 in \nNovember 2017. This debt is for unreturned equipment. Applicant testified that the \nequipment had been returned. (Tr. 43.) His credit counselor testified that the account has \nbeen reopened. The status report recites that the equipment has been returned and \ndeletion of the credit-report entry is pending. The debt was not reflected in the February \n2019 credit report. (GX 3.) This debt is resolved. \n \n \nApplicant did not submit documentary evidence of any payment agreements, \npayments, or correspondence from creditors for any of the debts alleged in the SOR. The \ncredit counselor\u2019s status report includes a footnote reciting that Applicant is currently \nwaiting for letters from creditors and that payment plans are scheduled to be completed \nby March 2020. (AX A.) \n \n \nApplicant currently earns about $42,000 per year. His net monthly remainder after \npaying all living expenses is $500-600. (Tr. 67.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n5 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n\n \n6 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe two debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g are duplicates. Only one debt to this \ncreditor is reflected in the more recent credit report from February 2019. When the same \nconduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g for Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment for four months was \na condition largely beyond his control. The replacement of his heating and cooling \nsystems was not a condition beyond his control, because he admitted that he knew the \n\n \n7 \n \nsystems would need replacement before he bought the house. However, he has not acted \nresponsibly. His financial problems began in 2017, but he did not contact his creditors or \nmake any efforts to modify his payments. He knew his financial problems raised security \nconcerns after his interview with a security investigator in October 2018, but he did not \nhire his financial counselor until March 2019. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not fully established. Although the evidence about his \ncredit counselor\u2019s qualifications is sparse, it appears that she is a \u201clegitimate and credible \nsource\u201d of financial advice and assistance. However, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nnot yet under control. His credit counselor has outlined a plan for resolving his debts, but \nhe has presented no evidence of payments or payment agreements to carry out the plan.  \n \nApplicant did not begin to address his debts until March 2019, well after his \ninterview with a security investigator and about the time he received the SOR. \u201cA person \nwho begins to address concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \naccess is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or \nher personal interests are not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019).  \n \nThe credit counselor\u2019s status report reflects that Applicant is relying on the \nunenforceability of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Even if judicial enforcement of this debt \nis precluded by the statute of limitations, reliance on such a remedy is not normally a \nsubstitute for good-faith efforts to pay off debt. ISCR Case No. 07-16427 (App. Bd. Feb. \n4, 2010.).  \n \nApplicant has submitted no documentary evidence of the payment agreements \nreflected in his credit counselor\u2019s status report. However, she was a credible witness, and \nher status report is sufficient to corroborate Applicant\u2019s testimony that he is trying to \nresolve his delinquent debts. However, there is no evidence that Applicant has started to \ncarry out his financial plan. Thus, the evidence reflects promises to pay debts \nunsupported by a track record of payment. Promises to pay delinquent debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant\u2019s credit counselor has given \nhim a plan to resolve his debts, but there is no documentary evidence of \u201csignificant \nactions\u201d to implement the plan. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n\n \n8 \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has taken a step in the right \ndirection by obtaining assistance in resolving his debts, but he has not established a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. If he carries out his plan for resolving his debts, he may \nbe able to qualify for a security clearance in the future. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37 through \nE3.1.39 (reconsideration authorized after one year). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has significant past-due student loans and another past-due debt.. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant has not acted responsibly under unforeseen \ndifficult circumstances that were completely beyond his control, and there are no clear \nindications that his financial issues are under control. Financial considerations is found \nagainst Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 1, her security clearance application, dated February 12, 2018, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant, 43, works as an attorney for a university that does significant research, including research for the DOD. The research facility she supports has sponsored Applicant to apply for a security clearance so that she can work more closely with it on classified matters. (AE M; SOR response.) Since childhood, Applicant has been a highly responsible person who believed strongly in giving back to her community. As she grew up, she was attracted to serving the U. S. Government in various capacities. She aspired to become a U.S. astronaut, then an FBI agent, and subsequently a member of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps. For various reasons, she was unable to pursue those dreams. After law school, she worked at a prestigious law firm, but found that to be unfulfilling. She resigned and in November 2003, she accepted a legal position at a research center affiliated with a university in State 1 and relocated to that state.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 30, 2019, admitting each of the three \nSOR allegations with additional comments in mitigation. She requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). Applicant \nsubsequently retained counsel, who entered her appearance in this case. On June 18, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 9, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing on July 24, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered two \ndocuments, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. Applicant\u2019s counsel \noffered 13 documents, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through M. All exhibits \nwere admitted into the record without objection. I kept the record open until August 1, \n2019, to give both parties the opportunity to submit a legal brief on a central issue in this \ncase. Both counsel timely submitted briefs. DOHA received the transcript on August 5, \n2019 (Tr.). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted, with explanations, all three allegations in the SOR. I have \nincorporated her admissions in the findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is \nextracted from GE 1, her security clearance application, dated February 12, 2018, unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 43, works as an attorney for a university that does significant research, \nincluding research for the DOD. The research facility she supports has sponsored \nApplicant to apply for a security clearance so that she can work more closely with it on \nclassified matters. (AE M; SOR response.) \n \n \nSince childhood, Applicant has been a highly responsible person who believed \nstrongly in giving back to her community. As she grew up, she was attracted to serving \nthe U. S. Government in various capacities. She aspired to become a U.S. astronaut, \nthen an FBI agent, and subsequently a member of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate \nGeneral\u2019s Corps. For various reasons, she was unable to pursue those dreams. After law \nschool, she worked at a prestigious law firm, but found that to be unfulfilling. She resigned \nand in November 2003, she accepted a legal position at a research center affiliated with \na university in State 1 and relocated to that state. (Tr. 21, 23, 29, 58; SOR response at 2-\n3; AE K.) \n \n \nIn April 2013, she relocated to State 2 to marry and to be near her parents. She \napplied for a highly competitive position with her clearance sponsor and was rated as the \nemployer\u2019s first choice. She began working at the university and is a respected and valued \nmember of the university\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office. She has a deep belief in the \nimportance of U.S. Government-sponsored scientific research and enjoys working as a \nlawyer in support of the research center of the university. (Tr. 24-26; SOR response at 4.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nIn 1995, while on vacation during a college break, Applicant contracted a serious \ninfectious disease that caused long-term damage to her immune system. Since then, she \nhas suffered multiple and significant diseases. In 2007 or 2008, she was diagnosed with \nfibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and an auto-immune disorder. To this date, she \nsuffers from chronic pain, muscle cramps and spasms, extreme skin sensitivity, and \ninsomnia due to pain. Over the ensuing years, she has taken opioids for pain, though only \non a short-term basis, and a number of other prescribed medicines for pain and insomnia. \nSome of these drugs have significant side effects, the most serious of which is addiction \nand, in one case, blurred vision. (Tr. 33-37, 42-45; SOR response at 3-4; AE A, H.) \n \n \nState 1 legalized marijuana for medical purposes by persons with a \u201cdebilitating \nmedical condition\u201d (Medical Marijuana) a few years before Applicant moved there. In \n2004, she obtained a doctor\u2019s \u201cpermission\u201d to use Medical Marijuana. At that time, State \n1 had no regulations controlling the sale and use of Medical Marijuana. The doctor\u2019s \npermission merely provided a legal defense to potential criminal charges for possession \nof marijuana. From 2004 to 2009, there were no legal sellers of Medical Marijuana in State \n1. From time to time, Applicant obtained, but claims she did not purchase, marijuana for \nher medical purposes from a third party, who also had a doctor\u2019s permission to use \nMedical Marijuana. In 2009, State 1 developed a regulatory scheme under which certain \ndoctors could write a certification and state-regulated dispensaries could legally sell \nMedical Marijuana. Applicant received a doctor\u2019s certification, submitted a Medical \nMarijuana Registry Application Form, and obtained a card to purchase Medical Marijuana \nat the dispensaries. Applicant testified that she always purchased Medical Marijuana from \nstate-run dispensaries. She used Medical Marijuana to relieve her chronic pain and \nmuscle cramping so that she could sleep at night. Starting in 2009, she used Medical \nMarijuana every night while living in State 1. (Tr. 36, 39, 58-61, 63-65; AE B, C.)  \n \n \nApplicant stored her Medical Marijuana in a cigar humidor. Months after moving to \nState 2 in 2013, she discovered the humidor, which had been in storage, and found that \nit contained some Medical Marijuana. She used that Medical Marijuana in State 2 in small \namounts on an occasional basis until mid-2016. (Tr. 45, 65-67.)  \n \n \nIn about 2014, State 2 decriminalized the possession of marijuana, and state \nregulations for the sale and use of Medical Marijuana become effective in late 2017. In \nApril 2018, Applicant received a doctor\u2019s \u201ccertification\u201d to be permitted to purchase \nMedical Marijuana at a state-regulated dispensary for chronic pain. She has registered \nwith State 2 to be able to purchase Medical Marijuana. She buys vape cartridges \ncontaining THC and other cannabinoids and uses the drug in the evenings. She has never \nused Medical Marijuana before or during work. It is not allowed on her university\u2019s \ncampus. In 2015, she received a workplace accommodation due to her medical condition \nthat permits her to telework from her home during flare-ups of her symptoms and to wear \nloose-fitting clothing in her office. She currently uses Medical Marijuana daily and intends \nto continue using it in the future. She does not believe that prescription pharmaceutical \ndrugs are an acceptable alternative to Medical Marijuana because they are less effective \nand can be addictive or have other side effects. (Tr. 47-50, 55, 66-72, 75; SOR response \nat 4; AE D, E, F at 3, I, J.) \n\n4 \n \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant argued that her use of Medical Marijuana that is \nlegally purchased and used in State 2 does not cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness or judgment. Her superiors at the university support her application and \nencouraged her to apply for a security clearance even though they know she uses Medical \nMarijuana. Applicant understands that if she is denied a security clearance due to her use \nof Medical Marijuana, her employment as a highly valued lawyer will continue. (SOR \nResponse; Tr. 54; AE M at 5.) \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s counsel submitted eight written character references in support of \nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation. The references attest to Applicant\u2019s excellent character, \nethics, and trustworthiness. The senior member of Applicant\u2019s university research center \nwrote that she asked Applicant to apply for a security clearance to enable Applicant to be \na fully informed member of the research department\u2019s efforts to protect information that \nis sensitive to national security. Applicant was selected for this role because of her \nintelligence, trustworthiness, and good judgment and because Applicant values honesty \nand integrity. With her SOR response, Applicant also submitted her performance reviews \nfor the last three years. Her performance was rated each year as \u201cOutstanding,\u201d which is \ndefined as \u201cExemplary performance in all areas of the job.\u201d(AE M; SOR response.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n5 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nThe parties have submitted legal briefs on the underlying issue of whether the use \nof Medical Marijuana that is legally prescribed under state law by a practitioner in that \n\n6 \n \nstate should be exempted from application of the Guideline H disqualifying conditions. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has established that the granting, denial, or revocation of \nindustrial security clearances is the exclusive province of the Executive Branch of the \nFederal Government. Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAccordingly, state laws \u201clegalizing\u201d marijuana for medical purposes cannot pre-empt \nprovisions of a federal national security program. Moreover, the DOD is not bound by the \nstatus of an individual\u2019s conduct under state law in evaluating the security implications of \nthat conduct and adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \n \nIn making that evaluation, I am guided by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s policy \nwith respect to the prosecution of marijuana offenses under the Controlled Substances \nAct, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq (the CSA). As recently as January 2018, the Department of \nJustice (DOJ) reiterated its position regarding the illegality of the possession of marijuana \nunder federal law. Jefferson B. Sessions, III, Attorney General Memorandum for all United \nStates Attorneys (Jan. 4, 2018.)  \n \n \nI am also guided by the 2016 ruling of the DOJ\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration \n(DEA) denying a petition by two state governors to reschedule Medical Marijuana and \n\u201crelated items\u201d as a Schedule II drug under the CSA. The DEA concluded, inter alia, that \nmarijuana has a high potential for abuse, that its abuse was widespread and can lead to \ndependence, and that it there is no \u201ccurrently accepted medical use for marijuana in the \nUnited States.\u201d DEA, Schedule of Controlled Substances: Maintaining Marijuana in \nSchedule I of the Controlled Substances Act at 3 (Jul. 2016) \n \n \nMore specifically as to security clearances, in October 2014, the then-Director of \nNational Intelligence (DNI), issued a memorandum addressing changes in state laws \nrelating to marijuana. He wrote: \u201cAn individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security \ndeterminations.\u201d James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, memorandum, \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (Oct. 25, 2014).  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard noted that the DNI\u2019s 2014 memorandum specifically stated that state laws \npermitting the use of marijuana \u201cdo not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines[.]\u201d The Board ruled that the Administrative Judge properly applied the \nAdjudicative Guidelines in concluding that the applicant\u2019s past use of marijuana was \ndisqualifying under the Adjudicative Guidelines of Guideline H and was not mitigated by \nthe fact that the applicant used marijuana to provide him with relief from chronic pain. The \nBoard also observed that \u201cDOHA proceedings are not a proper forum to debate the pros \nand cons of whether marijuana should be legal for some purposes, how it should be \nclassified as a controlled substance, or the merits of DoD policy concerning drug abuse.\u201d \nId. See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at fn. 1 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2018) (\u201cIt merits noting, \nhowever, that while several states have decriminalized marijuana or allowed its use for \nmedical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana remains subject to the applicable \ndisqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d) \n\n7 \n \n \nAccordingly, Appellant\u2019s admissions in her SOR response and the record evidence \nestablish the following potentially disqualifying condition under Guideline H:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition [in AG \u00b6 24]);  \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \n \nThe allegation in SOR subparagraph 1.b regarding Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana \nafter her completion and signing of her security clearance application covers a period in \ntime encompassed by the time frame alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a and is not an \nindependently disqualifying fact. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 26(c): abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged \nillness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since \nended. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. The behavior is current and frequent. The \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s health are somewhat unusual, but these \ncircumstances do not suggest that the behavior is unlikely to recur since Applicant intends \nto continue using Medical Marijuana. Applicant argues that her circumstances do not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. For the reasons set \nforth at length in my whole-person analysis, below, I conclude that the record evidence \ncasts doubts about her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(c) is not established. Under federal law, Applicant\u2019s use of Medical \nMarijuana constitutes an abuse of a controlled substance. The record also establishes \nthat Applicant has used Medical Marijuana pursuant to a state certification from a licensed \npractitioner similar to a prescription for a number of years to relieve the serious symptoms \nshe has experienced. The second prong of this mitigating condition, however, is not \nsatisfied because the abuse has not ended and Applicant has no intention to cease using \nMedical Marijuana in the future. Satisfaction of the second prong of this mitigating \ncondition is an important requirement for the application of this adjudicative guideline. \nApplicant has not provided the necessary mitigating evidence under this guideline. \n \n\n8 \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have considered the nature, extent and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct. Her \nknowing violation of federal law with respect to the possession of marijuana is \nproblematic. As an experienced and accomplished attorney, she has chosen to ignore \nher legal duty as a U.S. citizen to comply with federal law. Her conduct raises a concern \nas to whether she might find other federal laws to be inconsistent with her beliefs or her \nperceived necessities or convenience and might ignore them as well. Someone with \naccess to classified information cannot decide which federal laws will be followed and \nwhich will be ignored. I view the circumstances of her health conditions with much \nsympathy, and I understand the motivation of her conduct. Applicant has suffered more \nserious illnesses in her 43 years than most people could imagine experiencing in their \nlifetimes. I also find that Applicant\u2019s openness about her use of Medical Marijuana \nmaterially reduces the potential for pressure, coercion, or exploitation. Her health and her \nuse of marijuana in a state where Medical Marijuana has been legalized, however, does \nnot justify creating an exception to the established rules set forth in the Adjudicative \nGuidelines. Applicant\u2019s past use of Medical Marijuana, including at times when it was not \nlegal in State 2, and her intent to continue using the drug in the future raise unmitigated \ndisqualifying security concerns about her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Appellant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/26/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding alcohol consumption. \nEligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 10, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On March 11, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a set of interrogatories. He responded to those interrogatories \non April 12, 2019. On April 29, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated June 3, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on July 1, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on July 23, 2019. Applicant responded to the FORM \nby timely submitting a statement and associated documents, all of which were accepted \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on September 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations \npertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a general maintenance worker with his current employer since April 2017. He \npreviously served in a number of sales positions with other employers. Although he was \nhome schooled by an unaccredited source, Applicant earned his high school diploma \nthrough the General Educational Development (GED) program in 2008. He has never \nserved in the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant has never \nmarried. He has been cohabiting since 2014. Applicant has one child, born in 2016.   \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nApplicant commenced consuming alcohol after the age of 21, initially starting with \nbeer, but eventually graduated to mixed drinks with whiskey. The frequency of his alcohol \nconsumption commenced monthly at parties, but soon transitioned into two times per \nweek during the week and weekends at parties. Applicant acknowledged that he drank to \nintoxication at every party. He also acknowledged that he has gone to work hung over on \nmany occasions. Consuming alcohol to intoxication made him tired, sluggish, and \nemotional. He does not recall how much alcohol it takes to become intoxicated. (Item 6, \nat 7-8) Applicant has a substantial history of maladaptive alcohol use that has resulted in \nthree incidents described below. \n \n \nOn April 20, 2012, when he was about 22-years-old, Applicant attended several \ndifferent parties, consuming an unknown quantity of beer at each party. He left the last \nparty at about 2 a.m. While searching for friends, he dozed off while driving and rear-\n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nended a private security patrol car which was stopped at a stop light. It was estimated by \nthe authorities that he was traveling at about 50 miles per hour upon impact. He was \ncharged with driving under the influence (DUI), arrested, and jailed overnight. He entered \na plea of guilty to DUI, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to time served; ordered to \nattend nine months of First Offender Traffic School classes, six Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings; required to complete two weeks of community service; placed on 36 \nmonths of probation; and directed to pay restitution as well as about $2,000 in fines and \nfees. Applicant estimated that the total amount of costs eventually totaled between $8,000 \nand $9,000. He reportedly complied with the court mandates. (Item 6, at 6-7; Item 7) \n \n \nOn July 12, 2014 (as opposed to June 2014, as stated by Applicant and as alleged \nin the SOR), Applicant consumed two whiskey and cokes while at home. At about 10 \np.m., he decided to drive to a store to obtain items for the following day\u2019s lunch. He was \nstopped by the local deputy sheriff for a faulty license plate light. The deputy inquired if \nApplicant had been drinking, and Applicant admitted that he had. Applicant was \nadministered a blood alcohol content test (BAC) and the result registered 0.08 percent. \nApplicant was charged with prohibited license plate lights; possession of alcohol \nbeverages in motor vehicle; and operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI). (Item 7, at \n2; Item 6, at 6) He was arrested and jailed overnight. He entered a plea of guilty to DWI, \na misdemeanor, and was sentenced to time served; ordered to attend nine months of \nFirst Offender Traffic School classes, and view a number of traffic videos; required to \ncomplete an unspecified period of community service; placed on six months to a year of \nprobation; and directed to pay an unspecified amount in fines and fees. Applicant \nestimated that the total amount of costs eventually totaled between $4,000 and $5,000. \nHe reportedly complied with the court mandates. (Item 6, at 6-7) \n \n \nIn May 2017, during an interview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant denied that he had a problem with alcohol, \nor that alcohol has had any impact on his work, home life, school, or current friendships. \n(Item 6, at 8) \n \n \nOn January 21, 2019, after apparently consuming an unspecified quantity of \nalcohol, Applicant was stopped by the local police authorities and charged with DUI, a \nmisdemeanor; and DUI alcohol with a BAC of 0.8 percent. (Item 5; Item 8) He was \narrested and jailed overnight. He entered a plea of nolo contendere to DUI alcohol, a \nmisdemeanor, and the DUI was dismissed in the furtherance of justice. Applicant was \nsentenced to ten days in jail, with credit for the one day served; entered into a 9-day work \nrelease program; ordered to attend a Traffic and Alcohol Awareness School (TAASK) for \nits multiple offender 18-month program; placed on summary probation for five years - \nserved without supervision by a probation officer; required to have an ignition interlock \ndevice installed on any vehicle he may drive for a period of three years; subjected to \nrandom search for alcohol; and directed to pay $2,018 in fines and fees. (Item 5; Item 8) \nApplicant complied with the interlock requirement on July 18, 2019. (Verification, attached \nto the Response to the FORM) As of July 29, 2019, he had completed a portion of the \nrequired TAASK sessions. (Progress Report, attached to the Response to the FORM) As \nof August 6, 2019, he had paid $60 of his total fine (Statement, attached to the Response \nto the FORM)   \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n \nApplicant now claims that he has learned his lesson and, effective January 21, \n2019, he decided to become completely sober, and he stopped drinking any kind of \nalcohol. With regard to the most recent incident (the one in January 2019), Applicant \nstated that he was \u201cgoing through a very stressful and emotional situation at the time,\u201d \nnot otherwise specified, and he \u201cdecided to use alcohol to numb the pain.\u201d He claimed \nthat he is \u201cnot normally a heavy drinker.\u201d (Statement, attached to the Response to the \nFORM) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:  \n      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), and 22(c) have all been established. AG \u00b6 22(d) has not been \nestablished as there is no evidence of any alcohol-related diagnosis. Applicant \ncommenced consuming alcohol, starting with beer, but eventually graduated to mixed \ndrinks with whiskey. By his own admission, he consumed alcohol two times per week \nduring the week and weekends at parties, and he drank to intoxication at every party. He \nalso acknowledged that he has gone to work hung over on many occasions. Applicant \nhas a substantial history of maladaptive alcohol use that has resulted in three alcohol-\nrelated arrests and convictions, with the most recent incident occurring in January 2019.  \nThe guideline also includes several examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that \ncould mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Despite two arrests and convictions for \nDUI (in 2012) and DWI (in 2014), accompanied by a variety of sentences, including \nminimal overnight stays in jail, fines, attendance of First Offender Traffic School classes, \nAA meetings; community service; and periods of probation, Applicant learned little if \nanything regarding drinking and driving. Rather than learning from the alcohol classes \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nand considering the negative impact of his continuing alcohol-related conduct, he \nreturned to his pattern of alcohol consumption. As recently as May 2017, Applicant denied \nthat he had a problem with alcohol, or that alcohol has had any impact on his work, home \nlife, school, or current friendships. In doing so, Applicant minimized the negative impact \nhis alcohol consumption had on him.  \n \nThe result was Applicant\u2019s third DUI/DWI in seven years, the January 2019 arrest \nand conviction. This time, Applicant was sentenced to ten days in jail, with credit for the \none day served; entered into a work release program; ordered to attend TAASK for its \nmultiple offender 18-month program; placed on summary probation for five years \u2013 a \nperiod that has only recently begun; required to have an ignition interlock device installed \non his vehicle(s) for a period of three years; subjected to random search for alcohol; and \ndirected to pay fines and fees. Applicant has complied with the interlock requirement, but \nas of July 29, 2019, he had only completed a portion of the required TAASK sessions; \nand as of August 6, 2019, he had paid only $60 of his total fine.  \n \nApplicant now claims that he has learned his lesson, decided to become \ncompletely sober, and allegedly stopped drinking any kind of alcohol. That purported \nintention and abstinence occurred only within the last eight months, after a period of over \nseven years of maladaptive alcohol use and repeated attendance at alcohol classes. It is \nsignificant that the court was concerned following the January 2019 DUI because of the \ncontinuing restrictions it placed on him. While Applicant\u2019s newly-declared intention is to \nremain abstinent, and such a plan is to be encouraged, that declaration is simply too \nrecent to be given too much weight in light of the duration of his maladaptive alcohol use \nand the three alcohol-related incidents. Appellant has failed to demonstrate a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence, and under the circumstances, \nthere remain doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption \nconcerns. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as a general maintenance worker with his current employer since April 2017. He \npreviously served in a number of sales positions with other employers. Although he was \nhome schooled by an unaccredited source, Applicant earned his high school diploma \nthrough the GED program in 2008. He claims that he has been abstinent since his most \nrecent arrest in January 2019, and that he intends not to consume alcohol in the future. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. By his own admission, Applicant consumed alcohol two times per week during \nthe week and weekends at parties, and he drank to intoxication at every party. He also \nacknowledged that he has gone to work hung over on many occasions. Applicant has a \nsubstantial history of maladaptive alcohol use that has resulted in three alcohol-related \narrests and convictions, with the most recent incident occurring in January 2019. He has \nbeen repeatedly jailed, fined, placed on probation, and ordered to take alcohol training.  \nHe had to attend AA meetings. Now he is required to have the ignition interlock device \ninstalled on his vehicle(s) for a period of three years; subjected to random search for \nalcohol; and he will be on probation for approximately four more years. Applicant offered \nno evidence from witnesses to attest to his character or furnish support for his claimed \nabstinence.  \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nconsumption. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 2, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n \nOn May 25, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 26, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 10, 2019, and the hearing \n\n \n2 \n \n \nwas held on September 25, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-6, which \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, but he did not offer any exhibits at \nhearing. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 7, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the allegations. I adopt his admissions as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old. He is single and has no children. Applicant started \nworking for his current federal-contractor-employer during the summer of 2016 before \nhis final year of college as an intern. After his graduation in December 2016, he \nresumed his employment with this federal contactor. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and \nis currently pursuing his master\u2019s degree. (Tr. at 5-6, 19; GE 1-3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used and purchased marijuana, with varying \nfrequency (from approximately December 2011 to at least November 2016); that he \nused codeine, for non-medicinal purposes without a prescription in about August 2015; \nthat he used cocaine, on multiple occasions (from approximately October 2013 to at \nleast January 2015); that he used \u201cspice\u201d (synthetic marijuana containing THC) on \nmultiple occasions (from approximately November 2011 to at least April 2012); that he \nused hallucinogenic mushrooms on at least one occasion in about March 2012. The \nSOR also alleged that Applicant falsified his answers when completing his security \nclearance applications (SCA) in March 2017 and June 2016 when he failed to disclose \nhis drug use, other than marijuana, within the last seven years on his March 2017 SCA, \nand when he failed to disclose his overall drug use, including marijuana, on his June \n2016 SCA. The SOR further alleged that in 2016 and 2017, Applicant deliberately \nprovided false information to his employer regarding his overall drug use history. \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he used all the illegal substances alleged in the \nSOR. He claims that his last use of any illegal drug was his use of marijuana in \nNovember 2016, which was after he completed his first SCA in June 2016. His last \nillegal use of prescription drugs was in March 2016. He testified that he does not intend \nto use any illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. 22-24; GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant began using marijuana while in high school. He used marijuana by \nsmoking it and eating \u201cedibles.\u201d He used marijuana as much as \u201ca couple of times a \nmonth.\u201d He enjoyed the effects marijuana had on him. In college, Applicant increased \nhis marijuana use to four to five times weekly. He claims that from August to December \n2014, his marijuana use decreased to once weekly because his grades had dropped. \nHe generally used marijuana at the fraternity house where he resided. In January 2015, \nhis marijuana use again increased to four to five times weekly and on multiple times \nduring the day. He claims that he abstained from using marijuana from March to June \n2016 because he was selected for an internship by his current employer. His internship \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(and follow-on employment) was in a state which legalized marijuana use, unlike the \nstate where he attended high school and college. In June 2016, while he was \nperforming his internship, he purchased an eighth of an ounce of marijuana from a \nmarijuana dispensary in the state where his internship was located. He took the \nmarijuana back to his state of residence where he used it from June to August 2016. He \ncontinued to use marijuana until November 2016, stopping because he anticipated a \ndrug test from his prospective employer. Applicant estimated that from 2011 to 2016, he \npurchased approximately 64 grams of marijuana for which he spent approximately \n$1,080. (Tr. at 22-24; GE 3, 6) \n \n \nApplicant used the synthetic drug spice while in high school from 2011 to 2012. \nIn about August 2015, Applicant and some friends used prescription cough syrup \ncontaining codeine by smoking it using a water bong. He did not have a prescription for \nthe cough syrup. He used it because of peer pressure and out of curiosity. In about \nMarch 2012, he used hallucinogenic mushrooms on one occasion while in high school. \nHe used them because of peer pressure and out of curiosity. He experienced euphoric \nfeelings by using them. He claims he used cocaine on two occasions while in college, in \nOctober 2013 and January 2015. On both occasions, he inhaled a three-inch line of \ncocaine through his nose. He purchased the cocaine on one instance and it was given \nto him on the other occasion. He was invigorated after using the cocaine. (GE 3, 6) \n \n \nApplicant completed a SCA in June 2016, as a requirement for his internship. In \nresponse to a question asking about his illegal drug use in the past seven years, he \nanswered in the negative. This answer was false and Applicant knew it was false at the \ntime. He intentionally provided false information about his past illegal drug use for two \nreasons. He believed it was a private matter and because he was afraid his disclosure \nof his drug use would jeopardize his chance at the internship. (Tr. 25-26; GE 2-3)  \n \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant was hired for a full-time position from the government \ncontractor which offered him his internship. He was going to be working on a different \nprogram which required him to complete another SCA. Applicant was informed about \nthis requirement to complete another SCA and was panicked because of his earlier \nfalsification about his drug activity. He completed the second SCA in March 2017. When \nanswering the question about past illegal drug use, Applicant responded affirmatively by \nreporting some marijuana use, but failing to list any of his other drug use. He \nunderreported his marijuana use and falsified the date of his most recent use. Applicant \nadmitted these falsifications. (Tr. at 25-28; GE 1, 3, 6) \n \n \nDuring the process of Applicant completing his March 2017 SCA, his employer \ndiscovered the discrepancy concerning his drug use information listed on the two SCAs. \nApplicant initially lied to his employer\u2019s security personnel about the reason for the \ndiscrepancy. Upon further investigation by his employer, Applicant admitted to his \nintentional lying about his past drug use and his intentional falsifications of his SCAs. \n(GE 5-6) \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant admitted extensive and varied drug use as recently as November 2016, \nwhich was after he completed his first SCA and worked for his employer as an intern. \nHe intentionally concealed this information from his employer creating a vulnerability to \nexploitation. The evidence supports his deliberate falsifications on two SCAs and his \nlying to his employer about his drug history. All the above disqualifying conditions apply.    \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nWhile Applicant claims his last drug use was in November 2016, his marijuana \nuse was fairly extensive over a period of years. He continued his use after he completed \nhis first SCA when he was employed as an intern for a defense contractor. He lied \nabout his drug use on two SCAs and when asked about his disclosure discrepancies by \nhis employer\u2019s security personnel. Providing false information on a SCA is not a minor \noffense because providing honest and truthful information is important to the overall \nsecurity review process. Applicant\u2019s actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions fully apply.   \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.   \n       \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s statement \nof intention of no future marijuana use. However, I also considered that he used \nmarijuana and other drugs on numerous occasions and lied about his use on multiple \noccasions.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a - 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Applicant defaulted on 25 accounts and has \nadmitted each delinquent debt. The total of the admitted debts is about $31,000. The \nSOR also alleges that he deliberately provided false information when he submitted his \nsecurity clearance application by omitting information about a judgment and by failing to \ndisclose 22 pre-existing debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant provided insufficient \nevidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised under Guideline F. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence, however, did not establish the falsification allegations under \nGuideline E. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nIn February 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking a clearance as a first-time applicant. He had previously applied for a position of \ntrust. In April 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD \n\n2 \n \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on an unspecified date, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. As noted, he admitted the \nallegations under Guideline F, but failed to provide any documentation regarding \nmitigating steps taken to address his debts. He did not admit or deny the two falsification \nallegations under Guideline E, but he did write an apology for not having the information \nabout his debts when he prepared the SCA. He noted in his answer that his wife suffered \nfrom diabetes for three years before her death and that as a result of his lost time at work, \nhe was let go at a good-paying job and has struggled financially. He concludes his SOR \nresponse writing: \u201cI have now got on the right path of paying off my debts on my credit.\u201d \n(GE 3 at 4.) \n \nOn July 8, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case in \na File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included ten attached documents, identified as \nItems 1-10. Applicant received the FORM on July 15, 2019. Department Counsel notified \nApplicant in the FORM that he had the opportunity to file objections and to submit a written \nresponse and documents to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by \nthe SOR allegations. He did not respond to the FORM.  \n \nBy failing to respond to the FORM, Applicant raised no objection to the admission \nof Item 5 attached to the Government\u2019s FORM, which is an unauthenticated report of \ninvestigation summarizing Applicant\u2019s July 31, 2018 background interview. Department \nCounsel advised Applicant in her FORM that Applicant had the right to object to the \nadmissibility of this evidence as unauthenticated by a government witness and that his \nfailure to do so may constitute a waiver of any objection he may have. He was also \nadvised in the FORM that he could provide corrections or updates to the information \nsummarized in the document. By failing to respond to the FORM, Applicant made no \nobjections or comments about Item 5. I conclude that he has waived his right to object to \nthe admissibility of this document.  \n \nI have marked the ten Items attached to the FORM as Government Exhibit (GE) \n1-10. The evidentiary documents, GE 4-10, are admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on September 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.y. I have also considered his notation in his SOR response that at the time he \nprepared the SCA, he was unaware of the delinquent debts on his credit report. \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 4, his SCA, unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \n\n3 \n \nthe pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM, and the documentary evidence in the record, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and is a widower with two children, ages 23 and 15. His \nwife of 15 years died in 2015 or early 2016 after a three-year illness. He lost his job in \n2015 due to missing too many days from work to care for his wife during her illness. Since \nOctober 2016, he has worked as a warehouse tech for his security clearance sponsor. \nHe does not claim in his SCA any periods of unemployment, though he may have been \nunemployed or underemployed for a brief period in late 2015 and early 2016. In his SOR \nresponse, he describes the job he lost in 2015 as a \u201cgood paying job.\u201d He also suggests \nthat he suffered a financial loss working at another job in 2016 before he began working \nin his current position. He concludes with the following statement: \u201cSo I did what I could \nto make ends meet. I have now got on the right path of paying off my debt on my credit \n[report].\u201d (SOR response at 4.) \n \n \n \nAs noted, Applicant has admitted all of his indebtedness set forth in the 25 SOR \nallegations, which total about $31,000. The SOR alleges 16 medical collection debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m-1.t, and 1.v-1.y) with a total amount of $12,304. He noted \nin his background interview that his insurance had lapsed, presumably after he lost his \njob in 2015. He acknowledges some of the bills are for his medical care. Presumably \nsome or most of the others relate to his wife\u2019s medical care, though some of the medical \nbill may also have been for medical expenses for his children. The nine remaining debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.u) total $18,723 with an auto loan deficiency debt of \n$10,646 following a voluntary repossession in 2014, being the largest debt. The other \nlarge non-medical debts alleged are for an electric bill (SOR \u00b6 1.b), two delinquent rent \nbills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j) and a cell phone bill (SOR \u00b61.l). These bills total $6,043. (GE \n3, 5, 6-8.) \n \n \n \nIn his July 2018 background interview. Applicant denied any knowledge about \nhaving any delinquent debts. When confronted by his the interviewer that he had a \nnumber of outstanding debts, Applicant stated that he intended to contact these creditors \nand work with them to pay off his debts. Since he failed to provide any evidence of \npayments with his SOR response and he did not respond to Department Counsel\u2019s \nFORM, the record contains no evidence of any steps he took to pay the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. (GE 3, 5.) \n \n \n \nIn his background interview, Applicant advised the interviewer that he was \nunaware of any collection accounts. He also stated that he was unaware of any judgments \nagainst him, including the judgment in favor of a residential company in the amount of \n$757, which is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. The interviewer did not develop any facts to suggest \nthat Applicant knew about these debts at the time he prepared the SCA or that he \ndeliberately omitted the debts from the SCA. In his SOR response, Applicant did not \nspecifically respond to the two Guideline E falsification allegations. Instead, he wrote the \nfollowing comment: \u201cPlease forgive me I wasn\u2019t familiar with what was all on my credit, I \napologize for my lack of information.\u201d It is apparent that his intent was to deny he \ndeliberately provided false information because he was unaware of them. (GE 3, 5.) \n\n4 \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted with his FORM part of an application for a position \nof public trust (SF85P) signed by Applicant in April 2011 and an April 2011 credit report. \nShe notes that Applicant\u2019s credit report reflects that he had about $22,000 in delinquent \ndebt and that he failed to disclose these debts in his SF85P as he did in the SCA. (GE 9, \n10; FORM at 6.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n5 \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability to satisfy debts;\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(e) \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means . . ., which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, . . . a history of late payments or of \nnon-payments, or other negative financial indicators.\u201d \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. At least some of the debts arose due to the \nunique circumstances of the terminal illness of Applicant\u2019s wife and his loss of \nemployment due to that situation. Applicant has not, however, provided sufficient \nevidence to permit a conclusion that it is unlikely that his negative financial condition will \nrecur or that his indebtedness does not cast doubt upon his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established to the extent that some of Applicant\u2019s debts likely \narose due to circumstances beyond his control. He presented insufficient evidence to \nsupport a conclusion that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances since the \nrecord contains no evidence that he is making payment arrangements with any of his \ncreditors. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant provided no evidence that he has received \nfinancial counseling or that his indebtedness is being resolved or is under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant provided no evidence that he has initiated \na good-faith effort to repay his creditors or otherwise resolve his numerous debts. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant does not dispute any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nThe following disqualifying condition under Guideline E is potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b616 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel seeks to establish that Applicant deliberately omitted \ninformation in response to questions in the SCA regarding his financial condition. One \ncould reasonably conclude that the evidence presented was sufficient to meet the \nGovernment\u2019s substantial evidence burden establishing that Applicant deliberately \nomitted derogatory information about his debts. An alternative reasonable view of the \nevidence, however, is that Applicant was simply unaware of his financial condition in \nFebruary 2017 when he prepared the SCA. The fact that he had endured his wife\u2019s three-\nyear terminal illness and the loss of his job supports the conclusion that he had simply \nnot focused on his debts at that time. The fact that he had made the same mistake in \n2011 supports an argument that Applicant lacked the training to manage his finances and \nto review his credit report. I conclude that Applicant had insufficient information about his \ndebts at the time he prepared his SCA, and therefore, he did not intentionally omit \ninformation about his debts in the SCA. Accordingly, I conclude that the Government has \nfailed to meet its burden of proof to establish a disqualifying condition under this guideline.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are (1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \n\n8 \n \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under these Guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.y:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility \nfor holding a public trust position  is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn March 18, 2019 the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons \nwhy DoD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility to hold a \npublic trust position, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether eligibility to hold a public trust position should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National \nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 16, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on May 23, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in the \nFORM. He did not supplement the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 19, \n2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated seven delinquent debts \nexceeding $22,000. Allegedly, these debts remain  unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covered by \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g with explanations. He claimed he accrued some of the listed debts during \na period of financial hardship between 2011 and 2015. He claimed he never stole, sold \nout, or took any actions that could put in jeopardy the security or integrity of the U.S. \nGovernment.  And, he claimed he has a wife and five-year-old son who depend on him. \nFinding   s    of Fact \nApplicant is a 36-year-old customer service representative for a defense contractor \nwho seeks eligibility to hold a public trust position. The allegations covered in the SOR \nand admitted by Applicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material \nfindings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in November 2012 and has one child (age five) from this \nmarriage. (Item 3) He earned an associate\u2019s degree in May 2004 and a bachelor\u2019s degree \nfrom the same university in November 2005. (Item 3) Applicant reported no military \nservice. \nSince July 2018, Applicant has worked for his current defense contractor. (Item 3) \nHe was employed by a government agency between 2011 and 2015 and worked \ntemporary jobs for non-defense contractors intermittently between December 2006 and \nJanuary 2015. (Items 3-4) Applicant reported periods of unemployment between April \n2010 and January 2015. (Items 3-4) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2011 and 2015, Applicant accumulated seven delinquent debts \nexceeding $22,000. He attributed his debts to financial hardships while employed by a \nfederal agency between February 2011 and January 2015. (Items 3-4) To date, Applicant \nhas not addressed any of his identified delinquent debts in any tangible way. Nor has he \nfurnished any documentation of financial planning to resolve his debts or provided \nevidence of budgeting or financial counseling. \n2 \n\n                \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the \ndecision-making process covering public trust cases. These guidelines take into account \nfactors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well \nas considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nhandle sensitive information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a trust \nconcern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \nconditions that could mitigate trust concerns. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not eligibility to \nhold a public trust position should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not \nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines \nis to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 \n2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable trust risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel [trust] concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . \n.  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's eligibility to hold a public trust position may be made only upon a \nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because \nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the \nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's \neligibility for a public trust position depends, in large part, on the relevance and \nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 \n(1995). \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na public trust position. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused sensitive information before it can deny or revoke eligibility to hold a public trust \nposition. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her trust worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all public trust eligibility \ndecisions must be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the \nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her public trust. \u201c[Public trust] determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nPublic trust concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent \ndebts between 2011 and 2015. During this time, he has accumulated over $22,000 in \ndelinquent debts without any probative explanation aside from his periods of \nunemployment and claimed financial hardships while employed by a federal agency \nbetween 2011 and 2015. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nJurisdictional issues \nHolding a public trust position involves the exercise of important fiducial \nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor in \nprotecting and guarding personally identifiable information (PII). DoD Manual 5200.02, \nwhich incorporated and canceled DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, covers both critical-\nsensitive and non-critical sensitive national security positions for civilian personnel. See \n5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a(3)(c)3. \nDefinitions for critical-sensitive and non-critical sensitive positions provided in \n5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a (3)(c) contain descriptions similar to those used to define ADP l and II \npositions under DoD Regulation 5200.2-R. In 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154.13 and Part 154, App. J, \nADP positions are broken down as follows: ADP I (critical-sensitive positions covering \nthe direction, design, and planning of computer systems) and ADP II (non-critical\u00ad\nsensitive positions covering the design, operation, and maintenance of computer \nsystems). Considered together, the ADP I and II positions covered in DoD Regulation \n5200.2-R refine and explain the same critical-sensitive and non-critical-sensitive \npositions covered in DoD Manual 5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a (3)(c) and are reconcilable as \nincluded positions in 5200.02.  \nSo, while ADP trustworthiness positions are not expressly identified in DoD \nManual 5200.02, they are implicitly covered as non-critical sensitive positions that \nrequire \u201caccess to automated systems that contain active duty, guard, or personally \nidentifiable information or information pertaining to Service members that is otherwise \nprotected from disclosure by DoD 5400.11-R. . . \u201c. DoD 5200.02, Sec. 4.1, \u00b6 3(c). See \nDoD Directive 5220.6 \u00b6\u00b6 D5(d) and D8. By virtue of the implied retention of ADP \ndefinitions in DoD Manual 5200.02, ADP cases continue to be covered by the process \nafforded by DoD 5220.6.  \nFinancial Concerns \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the application of three of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; \n19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so\u201d;  and 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts negate the \nneed for any independent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on \nEvidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts are fully \ndocumented and create some judgment issues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect sensitive information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a public trust position that \nentitles him to access to sensitive information. While the principal concern of a public \ntrust holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving  debt delinquencies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to sensitive \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

May 21, 2008) \nIn \nApplicant\u2019s case, his failures or inability to establish documented payment initiatives \nwith his listed SOR creditors, both before and after the initiation of the public trust \neligibility adjudication process, prelude favorable findings and conclusions with respect \nto raised trust concerns over the state of his finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his delinquent debts to merit enough positive credit to \nmitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his \nfinances reflect little evidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to \novercome reasonable doubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nConclusions are warranted that his finances are not sufficiently stabilized at this \ntime to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a public trust position. \nEligibility to hold a public trust position under the facts and circumstances of this case is \ninconsistent with the national interest. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n                                                                       Conclusions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                        \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \nhold a public trust position.  Public trust eligibility is denied. \nRoger C. Wesley \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 1), I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old field service representative with a pharmacy technology company. He started his current employment in April 2018. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2004 and master\u2019s degrees in business administration in August 2011 and human resource management in December 2012. He has been married to his current spouse since March 1994. His first marriage lasted a little over a year and ended in divorce in March 1993. Applicant and his spouse have two sons, ages 13 and 15. (Items 2-3.) 4 Applicant was previously employed as a field service engineer with a medical devices and healthcare company from April 2003 to December 2013, when he was laid off during a corporate reorganization. He was given a severance package, the terms of which are not in the record. He collected unemployment compensation of $275 a week until June 2014, when he founded a tire distribution business with three partners. The venture was underfunded and folded after two years. From August 2014 to March 2018, he also had a part-time motor sports business, but it failed to generate the income needed to support his expenses. He closed the business when he began working for his current employer. (Item 2.)

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n12/20/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n___________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant became $65,000 past due on his home mortgage loan and had several \ncredit card debts charged off or placed for collection. His mortgage was resolved through a \nforeclosure sale, but more progress is needed toward resolving his credit-card \ndelinquencies. Applicant used cannabis or a derivative (cannabidiol) with varying frequency \nfrom 1983 to at least January 2018. His drug involvement continues to raise \ntrustworthiness concerns. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn March 29, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a public trust position \nfor him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n\n2 \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn August 3, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 13, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of five exhibits \n(Items 1-5). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him that any \nresponse was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on September \n26, 2019. No response to the FORM was received by the October 26, 2019 deadline. On \nNovember 26, 2019, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent national security to grant or continue a public trust position for Applicant.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 3, a summary report of a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on October 19, 2018. The summary report was part \nof the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personnel background report of investigation may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her \nopportunity to object to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; \nand there is no indication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, \nApplicant was provided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit \nobjections or material that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, \nApplicant was advised as follows:  \n  \nNote to Applicant: Exhibit 3 is a summary of your Personal Subject Interview \n(PSI) and is being provided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as \npart of the record evidence in this case. In your response to the [FORM], you \ncan comment on whether [the] PSI summary accurately reflects the \ninformation you provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you may \nmake any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make \nthe summary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you may object on the ground \nthat the report is unauthenticated by a Government witness and the \ndocument may not be considered as evidence. If no objections are raised in \nyour response to this FORM, or if you do not respond to this FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case. \n  \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. Concerning whether Applicant understood \nthe meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se \nstatus does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond those afforded him if \nhe was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he \nmay request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting \nevidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department \nCounsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide for a waiver of \nthe authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity \nto object to the admissibility of the interview summary report, to comment on the interview \nsummary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the \nreport. In the absence of any objections, I accepted Item 3 in evidence, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 29, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed charged-off debts of $9,224 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $6,781(SOR \u00b6 1.b), $5,269 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \n$2,492 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $1,340 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $2,666 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), in addition to a collection \ndebt of $4,171 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Additionally, Applicant owed a deficiency of $65,000 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g) on his home mortgage loan in foreclosure, and he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case \nin July 2018 that was dismissed in August 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Under Guideline H, Applicant \nis alleged to have used marijuana with varying frequency from about January 1983 to \nabout January 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, He admitted that he incurred the \ndebts alleged but indicated that the information about the accounts was inaccurate in that \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b had been cancelled and other accounts were undergoing repair. As \nfor the alleged drug involvement, Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana in the \npast, but asserted that he stopped using marijuana regularly in 2004 and used it only on \n\u201cvery few and rare\u201d instances since then. He stated that he lacked recall of any use of \nmarijuana after 2006 and explained that he had ingested CBD \u201con a few separate \ninstances\u201d prior to his present employment. (Item 1.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 1), \nI make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old field service representative with a pharmacy technology \ncompany. He started his current employment in April 2018. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in June 2004 and master\u2019s degrees in business administration in August 2011 and \nhuman resource management in December 2012. He has been married to his current \nspouse since March 1994. His first marriage lasted a little over a year and ended in divorce \nin March 1993. Applicant and his spouse have two sons, ages 13 and 15. (Items 2-3.) \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant was previously employed as a field service engineer with a medical \ndevices and healthcare company from April 2003 to December 2013, when he was laid off \nduring a corporate reorganization. He was given a severance package, the terms of which \nare not in the record. He collected unemployment compensation of $275 a week until June \n2014, when he founded a tire distribution business with three partners. The venture was \nunderfunded and folded after two years. From August 2014 to March 2018, he also had a \npart-time motor sports business, but it failed to generate the income needed to support his \nexpenses. He closed the business when he began working for his current employer. (Item \n2.) \n \nOn September 3, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed marijuana possession \ncharges from January 1998 and March 1999; the use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \nbetween January 1983 to January 2018; a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing dismissed in \nAugust 2018; the foreclosure of his home mortgage; and credit-card delinquency totaling \n$30,609 on nine accounts pending debt consolidation. Under the SF 86 section for \nadditional comments, he noted that he and his spouse had initiated a debt consolidation \nprogram for her finances, and that if it worked out as planned, he would incorporate his \nown debts as well. (Item 2.) The salient details of his financial issues and THC use follow. \n \nFinances \n \n \nApplicant bought a home for his family in 1999. (Item 2.) In August 2005, the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g acquired the mortgage, which had a balance of $310,000 and \nrequired repayment at $1,833 per month for 30 years. During the economic downturn in \n2008, the home lost value to where he owed more on the mortgage than the property was \nworth. Under some financial distress because of the lack of employment income and \nseeking to lower his monthly payments, Applicant tried three times to have his loan \nmodified. He stopped making his mortgage payments during the process, but was not \nsuccessful in having his loan modified. As of August 2018, the loan was $65,000 in arrears \non a balance of $415,933 and in foreclosure. Applicant unsuccessfully attempted a short \nsale to avert a foreclosure sale that was set for October 16, 2018. (Items 3-5.) When \ninterviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \non October 19, 2018, Applicant explained that he was negotiating with the creditor to \nsurrender the property in a \u201ccash for keys\u201d where the lender would agree to wipe out the \ndifference between the $325,000 expected sale price of the property and his loan balance. \n(Item 3.) When he responded to the SOR in August 2019, Applicant indicated that his \nhouse sold in foreclosure for $328,000, which exceeded the original balance of the loan, \nand that the debt had been removed from his credit record. (Item 1.) He provided no \ncorroborating documentation of the sale, but Equifax reported no mortgage trades on his \ncredit record as of March 4, 2019. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn July 2018, Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.i) to address his \ndelinquent mortgage loan and several credit-card delinquencies incurred because his \nmotor sports business did not generate enough income for him to pay all his bills. He listed \nindebtedness totaling approximately $700,000. Applicant completed the required pre-\n\n5 \n \npetition credit counseling, but his bankruptcy case was dismissed in August 2018, \nreportedly because he did not meet the financial threshold required to complete the \nbankruptcy process. (Item 3.) \n \n \nAs of October 9, 2018, Applicant\u2019s credit record showed that he owed $5,269 on a \ncredit-card account opened in July 2015 and charged off in August 2018 after being \ninactive since August 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Five credit cards obtained in January 2016 were \ncharged off or in collection with balances of $9,224 (SOR \u00b6 1.a, in collection); $6,781 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b, in collection); $2,492 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, charged off); $1,340 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, in collection); and \n$2,666 (SOR \u00b6 1.h, charged off). Additionally, a $4,171 credit-card balance had been in \ncollection since March 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Item 4.) During his October 2018 OPM interview, \nApplicant did not dispute the debts. He indicated that he had included them on his \ndismissed bankruptcy, and was working through a credit repair company to consolidate his \ndebts to make monthly payments. (Item 3.) On December 31, 2018, the creditor identified \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b had cancelled a debt of $6,781. (Item 1.) \n \n \nAs of March 4, 2019, Applicant had made no payments on his credit-card \ndelinquencies alleged in the SOR. (Item 5.) He was aware of his obligation to report the \n$6,781 as cancelled debt on his income tax return (Item 1), although he provided no \ndocumentation showing that it had been included on his income tax return for tax year \n2018. The $2,666 charged-off balance on a gas company credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.h) was not \non his credit record with Equifax as of March 2019, but there is no evidence that it had \nbeen paid. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant retained the services of a debt consolidation company around the time \nthat he began his current employment. Apparently \u201cafter several months of promises and \ninactivity,\u201d he terminated its services. (Item 1.) Applicant did not provide any information \nabout payments made, if any, to the company. On May 1, 2019, Applicant contracted with \nanother company to validate debts, dispute erroneous information on his credit reports, \nand to provide him with financial education. (Item 1.) \n \n \nOn March 29, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging in part his \ndelinquent debts and dismissed bankruptcy. Applicant received the SOR on May 6, 2019. \nOn May 22, 2019, he requested an extension of time to respond to the SOR. He indicated \nthat he had tried unsuccessfully to reach settlements with his creditors before hiring the \nfirst debt repair firm, which then failed to perform as expected. He expressed satisfaction \nwith the progress being made by the company currently retained to investigate, and where \nnecessary dispute the items on his credit report, but he also indicated that the company \nhad some problems locating two accounts (not identified) listed in the SOR. He stated that \nhe expected to have his debts settled within the next six months. (Item 1.) \n \n \nOn July 30, 2019, the debt repair company certified that the dismissed bankruptcy \nand the consumer debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c had been deleted from one or more of the \nthree credit bureaus\u2019 records and that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d-1.f were \n\u201cundergoing repair.\u201d (Item 1.)  In response to the SOR on August 3, 2019, Applicant \nindicated that the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h had been deleted from his record all three \n\n6 \n \ncredit bureaus, but the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d-1.f were still \u201cundergoing repair.\u201d \nHe added that it was taking some time to get the items resolved, explaining as follows: \n \nEvery disputed item has 45 days to respond and if no response they get \nanother 45 days. Then once validated we initiate a mutually agreed upon \nsettlement that will reflect on my credit report eventually. These results can \ntake 6 months or more to reflect on my credit report, yet we are seeing \nresults already. (Item 1.) \n \n \nApplicant had an opportunity to provide updated information in rebuttal to the \nFORM.  There is no indication that he responded by the October 26, 2019 deadline. No \ninformation was presented about Applicant\u2019s present income or expenses. During his \nOctober 2018 interview, Applicant indicated that he was able to pay his current bills and \ndebts on his current income. (Item 3.)  He provided no details about the extent of his \nspouse\u2019s debts that were reportedly being repaid through debt consolidation. Available \ninformation shows that Applicant owes approximately $150,140 in federal student loans. \n(Item 5.) Applicant told the OPM investigator that his federal loans were in a forbearance \nprogram with income-based repayment to start sometime in 2019. (Item 3.) It is unclear \nwhether he has started repaying his student loans. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nApplicant was arrested twice on marijuana charges. In January 1988, he was pulled \nover for making an improper left turn, and marijuana was found in his car. He was charged \nwith felony possession of marijuana. Adjudication was withheld and he was required to \nmake charitable donations totaling $1,000. He denies that he intended to sell any of the \nmarijuana in his possession. In March 1999, he was similarly stopped for a traffic violation, \nand a small amount of marijuana was discovered in his ashtray. The drug charge was not \nprosecuted. (Items 2-3.) \n \n \nOn his September 2018 SF 86, Applicant responded affirmatively to whether he had \nused any illegal drug in the last seven years and stated that he had inhaled vapor from \ncannabis oil on several occasions, but that he was not a user and did not like it. Regarding \nhis use of THC between the listed dates of January 1983 and January 2018, Applicant \nstated: \n \nOver the years it was helpful for dealing with stress, it no longer works for \nme. I was a weekly user prior to 2004. Since then I have tried it on a few \noccasions. I have found holistic alternatives to dealing with the day to day \nstresses. \n  \nApplicant denied any intention to use cannabis in the future because it makes him anxious \nand nervous and stated that he has turned to melatonin and valerian root as alternatives. \n(Item 2.) \n \n\n7 \n \n \nApplicant provided a detailed account of his involvement with THC and cannabis \nderivatives when interviewed by the OPM investigator in October 2018. He reported a first \nuse of marijuana in January 1983. He purchased the drug from a friend and smoked it \nthrough a pipe in his residence. He continued to use marijuana on a daily basis until his \nmarriage in March 1994. From March 1994 to the birth of his first son in November 2004, \nApplicant used marijuana once or twice weekly. His use of marijuana then declined to once \na week until 2008, when he stated that he decided to cease his use because marijuana \nmade him anxious. He stated that he abstained from all forms of cannabis until January \n2018, when he tried CBD obtained from a friend. He told the OPM investigator in August \n2018 that he did not like the effects of the CBD and would not use it again. Applicant told \nthe OPM investigator that he purchased the marijuana he used over the years from a \nfriend, although he did not indicate whether or not he was continuing to associate with the \nperson who supplied him with marijuana and CBD. (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant now claims that his use of marijuana after 2004 was rare, and that he \ncannot recall using marijuana after 2006. He instead asserts that since then, he \u201ctried\u201d CBD \noil and vapor, extracted from hemp, as a sleep aid: \n \nI have done some research and found that CBD from hemp is now legal on a \nfederal level. For CBD hemp oil products to test positive on a drug test, an \nindividual would have to be using unusually large amounts (above 1000-2000 \nmg) of the product. Hemp based CBD oils, when used in low doses, are \nunlikely to result in a positive drug test because they often don\u2019t contain high \nenough levels of THC for detection. Although unregulated CBD hemp oils \ncontain some THC it is a negligible amount of up to .3% THC or less and \nthus will not even be detectable in [a] traditional drug test. Again, I am not a \nuser [but] I did try it on a few separate instances. Many legitimate CBD \nproducts contain small amounts of THC, the component that is federally \ncontrolled. And when taken regularly over as little as four to six days, that \nTHC can accumulate in the body, according to several studies. My use of \nCBD was sporadic having tried it on a rare occasion prior to any employment \nwith [my employer]. (Item 1.) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the \nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with national security. The Deputy Under \nSecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November \n14, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by \nthe Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of \nDefense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the \nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \n\n8 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is \u201can examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a \nnumber of variables\u201d known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. \n \nThe person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 \n18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant for a public trust position is not required to be debt free, but is required \nto manage his finances in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The \nconcern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly compromise \nsensitive information for the money to satisfy his debts. An applicant\u2019s self-control, \n\n9 \n \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive information must be \nconsidered. See e.g., ISCR 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nApplicant stopped paying on his home mortgage loan in an ultimately unsuccessful \neffort to obtain a modification to lower his monthly payment. By August 2018, his loan was \n$65,000 past due and in foreclosure. He relied on consumer credit, including on several \ncredit cards obtained in January 2016, to pay some expenses because his motor sports \nbusiness was not generating enough income to meet his expenses. By the summer of \n2018, he owed about $31,943 in delinquent credit-card balances. He filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition in July 2018 to address the mortgage and his credit-card delinquencies, \nbut the bankruptcy was dismissed only a few weeks later. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c),\u201d a history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d \nare established. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by the delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nEvidence shows that the mortgage debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and the charged-off debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h have been removed from his credit record. The Fair Credit Reporting \nAct requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from \nthe first date of delinquency or if they become no longer legally collectible because of a \n\n10 \n \nstate statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c.  Debts may be \ndropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going to \nbe paid or when the debt has been charged off. The mere fact that debts have been \ndeleted from a credit report does not necessarily mean that they were not owed at one \ntime. Applicant presented no evidence that the deleted debts were not incurred by him. \nHowever, it appears likely that his delinquent mortgage loan was resolved in the \nforeclosure sale. He provided documentation showing that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b \ncancelled his debt, thereby relieving him of the legal responsibility for repayment of $6,781 \nin delinquent debt.  However, he presented no evidence indicating that the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h has been paid, settled, or otherwise resolved. Moreover, Applicant has yet to make any \npayments toward those debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c-1.f that are reportedly \u201cundergoing \nrepair.\u201d Those debts are considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were partially caused by circumstances outside of his \ncontrol. Applicant\u2019s unexpected layoff in December 2013 from his job of ten years is a \ncircumstance contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). Even so, he was granted a severance \npackage and collected unemployment for six months. It was his decision to start the tire \ndistribution business with three partners and his own motor sports business. He assumed \nthe risk that one or both of the business ventures would not succeed. He knowingly \nincurred credit balances when his income was not enough to cover his expenses. \nFurthermore, for full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), an individual is required to act \nresponsibly. He filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2018, but it was dismissed in \nAugust 2018. He then retained the services of a credit repair company that apparently \nmade little progress toward resolving the credit-card debts at issue. Despite being on notice \nas of October 2018 that his debts were of concern for the DOD, Applicant took his time \nbefore contracting on May 1, 2019, with the company now working on his behalf. Had he \nbeen more proactive about resolving his debts, he might have been able to show more \nprogress toward resolving his financial issues. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) might have some applicability, assuming Applicant\u2019s mortgage \ndelinquency was resolved through a foreclosure sale. However, if the property sold for \n$328,000 as Applicant claims, it would not have been enough to cover the $415,933 \nbalance reportedly owed as of August 2018. The lender may well have agreed to accept \nthe sales price in full settlement of his loan, which was originally for $310,000, and the debt \nno longer appears on his credit record. However, he provided no corroborating \ndocumentation showing that the mortgage delinquency has been resolved. Regarding the \n$6,781 in cancelled credit-card debt, the debt is no longer a source of financial pressure for \nApplicant. That being said, he benefitted from credit extended to him without having to pay \nfor it in the end. While some consideration of AG \u00b6 20(d) is warranted because he has a \ncredit repair company working on verifying his debts towards possible settlements, he has \nnot made enough progress to enable a predictive judgment that the credit card \ndelinquencies \u201cundergoing repair\u201d will be resolved in the near future. An applicant is not \n\n11 \n \nrequired to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts \npaid be those in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nHowever, the Appeal Board recently reiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. \n19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by \nconcomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d \nIn evaluating his financial situation overall, I cannot ignore that Applicant has made no \npayments on the delinquencies. Applicant told an OPM investigator in October 2018 that \nhis current expenses are being repaid on time. Without specific information in the record \nabout his income or expenses, it is difficult to conclude that his financial situation is \nsufficiently under control. Applicant owes federal student loans of $150,140 that will soon \nbe or are no longer in forbearance. As of October 2018, his spouse had debts of her own \nthat had been consolidated in a repayment plan. Assuming that Applicant is offered \nsettlements on one or more of the debts in the SOR, it is unclear whether he will be able to \nsatisfy the terms. The financial considerations concerns are not adequately mitigated. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are \narticulated in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nApplicant admitted on his SF 86 that he used cannabis (marijuana or CBD) between \nJanuary 1983 and January 2018. He told an OPM investigator in October 2018 that he first \nused marijuana in January 2013 and that he continued to use marijuana daily to March \n1994, once or twice weekly from March 1994 to November 2004, and once weekly from \nNovember 2004 to 2008, when he decided to stop using the drug. He also told the \ninvestigator that he used CBD once in January 2018, but that he did not like it so he did not \nuse it again. When he answered the SOR in August 2018, he discrepantly claimed that he \ncould not recall any instance of using marijuana since 2006, but he had tried CBD from \nhemp as a sleep aid  \u201con a few separate instances\u201d before he started his current job. Even \nif he used CBD exclusively after 2008, he has admitted to a history of illegal drug \ninvolvement spanning some 35 years. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d applies. CBD \nis one of over 100 chemical compounds known as cannabinoids found in the cannabis \nsativa L. plant (marijuana). Unlike THC, CBD does not have psychoactive properties. In \nJune 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of CBD in treatment of \nseizures associated with two forms of epilepsy, and added CBD to the list of controlled \n\n12 \n \nsubstances in Schedule V, but CBD remains illegal under federal law without a valid \nprescription. Applicant did not have a prescription for CBD, and it is no excuse that the \nCBD would not trigger a positive result for cannabinoids. Applicant purchased marijuana for \nhis personal consumption from a friend or friends over the years. His purchases were not \nalleged in the SOR, but AG \u00b6 25(c),\u201dillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; is still established because of his possession of cannabis for personal use. \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 could apply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s involvement with cannabis has been infrequent since 2008, his \nmany years of regular cannabis use and his recent involvement with CBD preclude \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a). Although he expressed an intention to avoid future use of \nmarijuana or any cannabis derivative such as CBD, his present abstinence since January \n2018 must be evaluated in light of the other evidence of record, including his long history of \ndrug abuse; his inconsistent statements about marijuana use since 2006 and about the \nnumber of times that he used CBD; the lack of information about whether he has \ndisassociated himself from the friend or friends from whom he purchased marijuana and \nobtained CBD; and his rationalization that his CBD involvement was somehow less serious \nbecause it lacked the THC component that would trigger a positive result in a drug screen. \nA lengthier period of abstinence is required for me to safely conclude that his drug \ninvolvement will not reoccur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n13 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide sufficient information about his circumstances to show that his financial situation is \nsufficient stable and not likely to present a trustworthiness concern and to show that he has \nput his drug involvement and substance misuse behind him. Not enough is known about \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation, including about his income and expenses, for me to \nconclude that he is able to address the SOR debts in the near future. He exhibited very \npoor judgment in violating the drug laws for so many years. After considering all the facts \nand circumstances, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to sensitive information at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 29, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 7, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on August 27, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 11, 2019, scheduling the hearing for October 24, 2019. The hearing was \npostponed for good cause and rescheduled for November 21, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted two documents at the \n\n \n2 \n \nhearing, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which I marked, and accepted into the record \nwithout objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until December 12, 2019. \nApplicant submitted five documents, which I marked as AE C-G, and accepted into the \nrecord without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November \n12, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR at the hearing based on Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony that she owed unpaid Federal taxes for years 2011 through 2018. Applicant \nwas given an opportunity to respond to the amendment. She did not object to the \namendment. The Government also issued a written request for clarification of amendment \non October 5, 2019, to conform to the oral motion. Thus the Government\u2019s motion is \ngranted.  \n \nParagraph 1 of the SOR is amended by adding subparagraph 1.i: \u201cYou are \nindebted to the Federal Government for at least $12,000, for tax years 2011 through \n2018.\u201d \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 51, is married and has two adult children. She obtained her high \nschool diploma in 1985. Applicant completed her security clearance application on August \n21, 2017. She has held a security clearance since 1988. (GE 1) She is employed as an \noffice manager for her current employer. She has maintained consistent employment \nsince 2001 and has not been unemployed in the past. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt in the approximate amount of \n$51,000. The debts include consumer loans and collection accounts. Applicant admitted \nthe majority of the allegations, but she denied some because she believed the accounts \nwere resolved or are in dispute.  Applicant noted that she used poor judgment and set \nthe bills aside and did not pay them. (Tr. 17) She denied the allegation under AG \u00b6 2.a. \nunder personal conduct concerns. She provided explanations for each allegation. The \namendment concerns the Federal tax issue that Applicant volunteered at the hearing.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged her financial hardship over the past seven years from \n2011-2018. She noted that she experienced many major life \u201cexperiences.\u201d She stated \nthat in her personal life, she helped her family and put her own financial obligations to the \nside. She noted that she has been working since 1988 and all was well until the past few \nyears. (Post-hearing letter, AE F) \n \n During Applicant\u2019s investigative August 2018 interview, she stated that she has \nbeen focused and is paying off debts on her credit report and trying to get some items \nremoved from her credit report. She recently started working with a credit consumer \nagency to dispute some debts. She wants to be back on track. She loves her job and \nwishes to continue. She takes responsibility and is attempting to correct the issues. \n\n \n3 \n \nHowever, she also noted that she knew she had defaulted on a loan but agreed to follow \nup within five days of the interview to discuss all the accounts. (GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant claimed that she paid some of the accounts, but has not received \nanything from the company to prove her assertion. As to SOR 1.a, Applicant submitted a \nletter of agreement, dated September 24, 2019, showing that she is paying $300 a month \non a loan that was delinquent in the amount of $15,538. The quoted balance is \n$14,338.07. (AE A) \n \nAs to SOR 1.b, Applicant stated that this charged-off account in the amount of \n$4,430 is an ongoing situation between her son and an insurance company. It was her \ncar and her son had an accident. She knows that something is owed, but she has not \naddressed the issue.  She did not elaborate and did not submit any documentation. (Tr. \n35)  \n \nAs to SOR 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $2,267, Applicant admitted \nthat she is now in a payment arrangement. She has made monthly payments of $50 since \nJune 2019. She had not made any payments before that time. The remaining balance on \nthe account is $2,017.02. (AE D)  \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, a collection credit account in the amount of $836, Applicant thought \nthat $200 a month was being made, but it was not. She presented a receipt, dated \nOctober 31, 2019, for the full amount, which showed the account is paid in full. (AE E) \n \nAs to SOR 1.e, a collection account in the amount of $153, Applicant denied the \ndebt because she called the company and they had no record of the account. (Tr. 41) \n \nAs to SOR 1.f, a 2017 medical account in collection for the amount of $52, \nApplicant is disputing this account. She stated that she has paid all her medical accounts \nand has not been able to resolve the issue with the doctor\u2019s office or the insurance \ncompany. She does not intend to pay until she understands why the insurance company \nwill not pay. (Tr. 46) \n \nAs to SOR 1.g, another medical account in the amount of $497, she has no idea \nwhat the account is for and she will take care of it when she is able. (Tr. 48) \n \nSOR 1.h a collection account in the amount of $2,063 for a timeshare that she \npurchased in 2011, she is aware of the debt, but she has not been able to address the \nmaintenance fees and taxes. She wants to sell it. (Tr. 49) \n \nAs to SOR 1.i, Applicant admitted that she owed Federal income tax for the years \n2011 through 2018. (Tr. 69) She approximated that she owed about $12,000. (Tr. 70) She \nwas not really certain about which years she may not have filed. (Tr. 89) \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions included documents that reflected she \nobtained the services of a tax preparer, with information provided for the years 2011-\n\n \n4 \n \n2018, with the exception of 2017. (AE G) She submitted documents that on November \n14, 2019, she had the tax returns prepared for tax years in question. She presented no \ndocumentation to show that a payment arrangement with the IRS is in place. \n \nApplicant\u2019s salary is about $80,000. She has a car note and a pension account. \nHer husband works and contributes to the household bills. She does not have a budget.   \nShe has taken a few vacations in the past years. \n \nWhen Applicant completed her 2017 SCA, she answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 26 \nconcerning judgments or liens in the past seven years. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section \n26 concerning bills or debts turned over for collection accounts.  \n \nApplicant denied that she intentionally falsified her 2017 SCA. In her answer, and \nin her testimony at the hearing, she claimed she had not thought of the accounts or was \nnot really aware of them. She answered \u201cNo\u201d and stated that she kept no information from \nthe investigator during her interview. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19 (f) (failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d) \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n\n \n6 \n \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are long-standing and she acknowledges that she had poor \njudgment and did not address the delinquent accounts. After the issuance of the SOR, \nApplicant began to contact some of the creditors and or dispute the accounts.  Admittedly, \nshe had made a few small payments before the SOR, but the payments were not \nconsistent. She has been gainfully employed. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts remain unresolved except for a few initial payments recently. She \npromises to address the accounts and to continue to pay them in the future. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant did not present any credible explanation \nfor the delinquent debts or that circumstances beyond her control caused the delinquent \ndebts, nor that she acted responsibly to address the resulting debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not receive any financial \ncounseling nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is under control. Only \nrecently did she begin to address the debts when she realized that her security clearance \nand employment were in jeopardy. As to the failure to pay Federal income taxes from \n2011 to 2018, Applicant provided no credible explanation. She has not yet established a \npayment plan with the IRS. Her financial problems are not under control. Any doubts must \nbe resolved in favor of the Government. \n \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i against Applicant. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n7 \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of her SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that she falsified her 2017 SCA, in her answer, and in her remarks \nat the hearing, she was adamant that she is a good person and has worked more than \n20 years with her current employer. She told the investigator that she was not aware of \nsome of the accounts. An omission, standing alone, does not prove a falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.1 An applicant\u2019s level of education \nand business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant \ninformation on an SCA was deliberate.2  \n \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments that she was not aware of \nsome of her delinquent debts. She should have disclosed the delinquent debts she had \nknowledge of on her SCA. However, I find insufficient evidence of an intent by Applicant \nto intentionally omit, conceal, or falsify facts from and on his SCA. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) \nis not established. \n \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant made prompt or good-faith efforts to correct her falsification or \nconcealment.  She spoke openly to the investigator during his interview. Applicant was \ncredible and has shown that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to recur. She provided \nsufficient information in this record to demonstrate that she has met her burden of proof \nfor her personal conduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, including her credibility and openness at the hearing, I \nconclude that Applicant did not deliberately falsify her SCA, but she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her financial indebtedness and delinquent taxes for the years \nin question. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: Against Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Applicant is 59 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984. He has been employed by the same federal contractor since 1984. He married in 1982 and divorced in 1997. He has three grown children from the marriage, who are ages 31, 33, and 36 years old. He remarried in 2005. He has two stepchildren from this marriage, who are ages 24 and 26 years old. He has held a security clearance since 2001.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n11/06/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 14, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on August 19, \n\n \n2 \n \n \n2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 5. Applicant did not submit a response to the \nFORM or object to the Government\u2019s documents. Items 1 through 6 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on October 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984. He has been \nemployed by the same federal contractor since 1984. He married in 1982 and divorced in \n1997. He has three grown children from the marriage, who are ages 31, 33, and 36 years \nold. He remarried in 2005. He has two stepchildren from this marriage, who are ages 24 \nand 26 years old. He has held a security clearance since 2001. (Item 3) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he and his wife cosigned for \nstudent loans, which were for his adult stepchildren, in order to finance their college \neducations. He explained that he and his wife made a joint decision not to keep the \nstudent loans current because they did not want to continue to enable the \u201ctheir \n[children\u2019s] lackadaisical effort in keeping their student loans current.\u201d (Item 2) He further \nstated:  \n \nThus, we actively chose to disengage from paying their loans for them. We \ndo fully realize that this action will temporarily hurt our credit rating however \nour hope is that the credit consequences for them will help them to come to \nrealize they need to re-engage on their own and keep their loans current for \nthe good of their own financial rating and future. (Item 2) \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2018. Section \n26 asked if in the past seven years Applicant had defaulted on any loan; had any bills or \ndebts that were turned over to a collection agency; had an account charged off; had any \nfinancial obligations that were over 120 days delinquent that were not previously \nmentioned or were currently over 120 days delinquent. The inquiry specifically noted to \n\u201cInclude financial obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as well as those for \nwhich you were cosigner or guarantor.\u201d (Item 3) Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to the inquiry.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated: \n \nAs far as my answer to the [SCA] concerning defaulting on loans etc., I \nanswered the questions \u2018NO\u2019 because the school loans are in our children\u2019s \nnames. Yes we did co-sign for their loans, but the main signature is with the \nchildren. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nCredit reports from July 2018 and March 2019 corroborate the debts alleged in the \nSOR. Applicant did not provide additional information on any current action he may have \ntaken to resolve repayment of the student loans.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation (See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so. \n \n \nApplicant owes delinquent student loans totaling approximately $69,415 that are \nunresolved. He cosigned for his stepchildren\u2019s student loans and because they have not \nbeen diligent in repaying the loans, he has refused to pay them. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant is a cosigner on his stepchildren\u2019s student loans, which means he agreed \nto be responsible for them if the children were not. He refuses to pay them in the hopes \nhis stepchildren will understand their financial responsibilities. This may be a sensible \nparental approach, but it is inconsistent with his obligation to the creditors. His failure to \nmeet his financial obligations cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant\u2019s financial issues were beyond his control. He has \nconsciously and deliberately decided not to fulfill his legal obligation. There is no evidence \nthe problem is under control or being resolved. Applicant has not made a good-faith effort \nto repay his creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n\n \n6 \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant was aware that he cosigned for his stepchildren\u2019s student loans and that \nthe loans were delinquent. The SCA specifically advises an applicant to disclose financial \nobligations, including those where the applicant is a cosigner. Applicant deliberately and \nknowingly chose not to do so. The above disqualifying condition applies.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant cosigned for his stepchildren\u2019s student loans confirming he would be \nresponsible for them if they were not. Because they have not taken action to pay them, \nApplicant wants to teach them a lesson. That does not relieve him of his obligation to \ndisclose this information to the Government or allow him to redefine his obligation \nregarding the loans. Applicant was aware of the delinquent student loans and made a \nconscious decision not to pay them or disclose them to the Government. The Government \nrelies on people to be forthcoming and honest on their SCA, even when it involves \nderogatory information. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because deliberately failing to disclose \ninformation on an SCA and swearing to its accuracy is not a minor offense. I find \nApplicant\u2019s omissions are serious and cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and F in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. As a parent he wants his stepchildren to be responsible \nfor student loans that they are signatories on and that funded their college education. \nHowever, as a cosigner on the loans, Applicant agreed to be ultimately responsible for \nthe repayment of the loans. He has consciously decided not to abide by his obligation. In \nmaking this decision, he also deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent student loans \non his SCA. He has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On April 30, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.) The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe AG dated June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 16, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on July 8, 2019.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing that same day, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on July 17, 2019.  The Government offered four \nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted without \nobjection. The Applicant did not offer any documentary evidence, nor did she request \nthat the record be left open following the hearing.  Applicant testified on her own behalf.   \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 24, 2019. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. She is married with two adult children.  She has a high \nschool diploma and two years of college.  She is employed with a defense contractor as \nan Administrative Assistant.  She is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment.        \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR \nidentified thirteen delinquent debts that have been charged off or placed for collection \ntotaling in excess of $30,000.  Applicant admits to each of the delinquent accounts listed \nin the SOR.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated September 13, 2017; and June 25, 2019; \nconfirm the indebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)      \n \nApplicant lives in the small town where she was born and raised, and because \nshe is not willing to work for minimum wage, she must drive a long way to get a job.  \nApplicant drives two hours each way to go to work with the defense contractor.  \nApplicant has never held a security clearance before, but she has held a position of \npublic trust.   \n \nDue to a history of job insecurity and health problems, over the past fifteen plus \nyears, Applicant has incurred delinquent debt that she has been unable to pay.  Her \nfinancial problems began in 2001 when she was out of work for shoulder surgery.  \nWhen she returned to work, she was laid off.  It took her about a year or so to find a job.  \nFollowing this, she encountered a series of situations where she would be hired by an \nemployer, work for a year or so, and was then laid off due to no fault of her own.  This \ncycle continued over and over again, until she obtained her present job with her current \nemployer.  Applicant explained that her husband\u2019s work history has also been unstable.  \nHe had a roofing business that at one time was doing well, but was forced to shut down \ndue to the crash in the economy.  He incurred business debt that he has been unable to \npay.  He had difficulty finding stable employment and has worked several small jobs, but \nhas had nothing steady until recently.  In 2009, Applicant took out a home equity loan in \nthe amount of $90,000 to do home improvements.  This loan also fell in arrears.  For the \npast year, Applicant\u2019s husband has worked as a handyman for a local housing tract.  \n(Tr. p. 30.)   \n \nIn addition to a history of job insecurity, Applicant and her husband have suffered \nhealth issues in the last couple of years.  She was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis \nand the medical deductibles have been high.  Her husband suddenly lost about 80 \npounds, and after numerous tests, it was determined that he had a thyroid problem.  (Tr. \np. 26.)  As a result, they were unable to work as much as they wanted to.  Applicant \nincurred a number of delinquent debts, and almost lost her home to foreclosure.  \n\n \n3 \n \nRecently, she has been able to catch up on the payments required by the mortgage \nlender, and was able to prevent her home from foreclosure.  Applicant has been in \nconstant contact with her creditors regarding her financial hardship.  She does not have \na financial budget that she follows at the present time.   \n \nApplicant began working for her current employer in 2018.  Although it has been \na slow process, she states that she is trying to resolve one debt at a time to get them \npaid.  She was told by an attorney that if she filed Bankruptcy, she would be \u201cred \nflagged\u201d and it could jeopardize her changes of obtaining a security clearance. \n   \nThe following delinquent debts became owing:  \n \n1.a.  A Federal student loan is past due the approximate amount of $1,088, with \na total balance of $30,699.  Applicant states that she opened the account in 2003 and \nmade some payments until she could no longer afford to.  She has contacted a debt \nconsolidation company that is going to help her restructure the loan.  (Tr. p. 25.)  The \naccount remains owing.    \n \n \n1.b.  A medical bill is past due in the approximate amount of $134.  Applicant \nexplained that the debt is in dispute because she believes her insurance should pay the \ndebt.  The account remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 27.)   \n \n \n1.c.  A medical bill is past due in the approximate amount of $101.  The account \nremains outstanding.  Applicant explained that the debt is in dispute because she \nbelieves her insurance should pay the debt.  The debt remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 27.) \n \n \n1.d.  A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $5,400.  \nThis was for the cost of her daughter\u2019s braces.  She last made a payment of $50 about \nMarch 2019.  She claims that she is paying it slowly.  The account remains outstanding.  \n(Tr. p. 28.) \n \n \n1.e.  A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $1,084.   \nThis was a credit card used to purchase clothing.  The account remains outstanding.  \n(Tr. p. 32.) \n \n1.f.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$575.  This was a credit card used to purchase food and necessities.  The account \nremains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 32.)    \n \n \n1.g.  A delinquent debt owed to a bank was charged off.  This was either for a \nsafe deposit box that Applicant had at the bank or a loan that went delinquent.  The \naccount remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 32.)   \n \n \n1.h.  A delinquent debt owed to a department store was charged off.  This was a \ncredit card used to purchase clothes.  The account remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 34.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1.i.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$7,807.  This was a credit card used for household necessities.  The account remains \noutstanding.  (Tr. p. 35.) \n \n \n1.j.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$6,897.  This was a credit card from her husband\u2019s business.  The account remains \noutstanding.  (Tr. pp. 44 - 45.) \n \n \n1.k.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$6,709.  This was a credit card from her husband\u2019s business.  The account remains \noutstanding.  (Tr. p. 47.) \n \n \n1.l.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$877.  This was for food and utilities.  The account remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 48.) \n \n \n1.m.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$154.  This was for equipment that the cable company claims the Applicant did not \nreturn.  The account is in dispute.  The account remains outstanding.  (Tr. p. 48.)   \n \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties due to loss of employment and \nhealth problems both she and her husband have suffered.  She may have even spent \nmore than she could afford from time to time; but for the most part, she has not had \nstable employment nor has she had proper financial counseling.  Applicant plans to pay \nher delinquent debts, but has not made any headway as of yet.  There is no \ndocumentary evidence to show that she has done anything to resolve even one of her \ndelinquent debts.  Furthermore, it is not certain whether she can or will pay her \ndelinquent debt and whether it is likely to recur.  There is insufficient documentation in \nthe record to show that Applicant can control her finances and live within her means \nwithout difficulty.  She remains excessively indebted.       \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n6 \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant is excessively indebted to the creditors listed in the SOR.  Although she \nnow has stable employment and her husband is working, she is just now able to start \nthe process of paying her delinquent debts.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant states that she plans to pay off her delinquent debts, one by one.  At \nthe present time, they all remain owing.  Under the particular circumstances here, \nApplicant has failed to establish that she has acted reasonably or responsibly with \nrespect to her debts.  As it stands, Applicant has started to address her debts and has \ndemonstrated nothing more.  She has not demonstrated that future financial problems \nare unlikely.  Most importantly, it has not been demonstrated that her current financial \nproblems are under control.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant states that she plans to address \nher debts one by one until they are all resolved.  However, at that present time, they all \nremain outstanding.  There is insufficient documentation in the record to show that \nApplicant has resolved or continues to work toward resolving her delinquent debt.  \nAccordingly, Applicant has not demonstrated that she is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Her husband has had a career with a fluctuating income due to \nmultiple jobs and, in 2010, a serious back injury which put him out of work for nearly two \nmonths. (Tr. 23) He recently changed careers in search of more stable employment. He \nnow works in heating and air conditioning repairs, and recently saw his pay increase \nfrom an hourly entry level of $15 to nearly $26 (approximately $54,000 a year). (Tr. 19)  \n \nThe couple has a savings account with a zero balance and Applicant has about \n$22,500 in a retirement account. The couple merges their incomes into the same \nchecking account. They contributed $6,000 last year toward Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter\u2019s \ncollege education; in the future, the child will be attending an on-line program and \nreceiving less money from Applicant and Applicant\u2019s spouse.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s rent is $1,900 a month. She has no car payments. Applicant has a \ncredit card with a balance of about $16,000 on which she has made timely payments, \nusually of about $350 a month. Although it has been some time since her husband \nearned an income of $65,000 a year, his contribution at that level once helped them \nretrain a monthly remainder of about a \u201ccouple hundred [dollars], after groceries, bills, \nand everything.\u201d (Tr. 30) At their present level of income, however, extra money is tight \nand no progress has been made on the delinquent debts at issue in the SOR. (Tr. 30) \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s erratic income history, Applicant attributes their \npresent financial problems on their pursuit of fertility treatments after their 2007 \nmarriage, post-birth intensive care related to the twins\u2019 premature births, on-going \npediatric medical care, and related expenses. (Tr. 33-35) Those costs amounted to \nabout $50,000, of which her parents paid about half. They have also paid about $20,000 \ntoward the multiple, unplanned surgeries that Applicant\u2019s hydrocephalic stepchild has \nreceived since Applicant and her spouse wed. (Tr. 37-38)  \n \nAt issue in the SOR are 19 accounts, most of which became delinquent in around \n2013. They amount to approximately $50,000. The accounts are mostly for credit cards \nthat were used to help her \u201cmake ends meet.\u201d (Tr. 39-40) In 2013, things \u201cgot to a point \nof just life catching up to\u201d Applicant . . . and she \u201ccouldn\u2019t stay above water\u201d financially. \n(Tr. 41) Due to a limited income, she was unable to make any payment arrangements \non these debts at that time. (Tr. 41) Initially, she contacted some of her creditors by \ntelephone to advise them of her situation, but the most aid she could get were waivers \nof some fees. (Tr. 41-42) Overwhelmed by making minimum payments but never getting \nahead, Applicant ultimately stopped making payments altogether. (Tr. 42-43)  She did \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nnot want to resort to bankruptcy to address her delinquent debts. (Tr. 43) She knew by \n2017, when she contacted one debt relief organization, that her finances could raise \nconcerns with her job. (Tr. 46) Adhering to the advice of, or information provided by, a \ncredit card reconciliation company, however, her plan going forward was to let the aging \ndelinquent accounts fall off her credit reports after seven years, let their deletions \nimprove her credit, and use the newly resultant financial score or status to buy a home. \n(Tr. 43-44) Consequently, the delinquent debts at issue remain unpaid and largely \nunaddressed. \n \nAt work, Applicant is a highly praised employee who is known for her efforts at \nself-improvement, dedication, and her overall value to her superiors. She presented \nmultiple letters of recommendation from the highest levels of her field to peers. (Exs. B-\nK) In particular, she is lauded for her professionalism, enthusiasm, and efficiency. She \nis ever-mindful of the importance of her work and her unit\u2019s goals. Indeed, her \nreferences are particularly persuasive. Her supervisor testified that Applicant has been \nof invaluable assistance to him and has made their unit a more positive and productive \nplace. He considers her to be a responsible individual. He looks forward to advancing \nher to a senior position to better utilize her talents.  \n \nRegarding her personal life, Applicant takes full responsibility for her financial \nissues and failures in dealing with them earlier. She is presently looking into avenues to \nbuild her credit score. (Tr. 58) She is open to whatever paths can help her in this goal. \nShe has contained her debt situation to those at issue in the SOR. Applicant concedes \nthat even if granted a security clearance at this time, her finances would remain an \nissue for the present. (Tr. 59) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, Applicant admitted responsibility for the delinquent debts reflected in the \nSOR. Those obligations amount to about $50,000 and remain largely unaddressed. This \nis sufficient to invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso, and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance-related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control, and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s mounting financial problems came to a head in 2013, in the wake of \nher husband\u2019s 2010 back issues adversely impacting his employment, and while the \ncouple dealt with the chronic health problems facing their children. The husband\u2019s \nerratic income continued to vary until he took a steep pay cut a couple of years ago to \nlearn a new trade. With a recent pay raise, he is just now poised to reap the benefits of \nthat laudable stratagem. Throughout this period, Applicant steadily maintained \nemployment and excelled at work, but the family\u2019s overall financial strain was never \nalleviated enough for her to address the delinquent debts at issue. Under these facts, \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part. \n \nApplicant did initiate contact with at least some of her creditors as the crisis in \n2013 erupted. She considered, then dismissed, the idea of declaring bankruptcy. She \nconsulted at least one or two professionals with superior experience in debt reduction or \nconsolidation. Because it is unclear whether such contact constituted financial \ncounseling, however, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Regardless, these facts are \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(d) in part. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old program analyst who has worked in the same position \nfor about 10 years. She has worked since the age of 15. She is a stellar and dedicated \nemployee, lauded by many in her field, and the recipient of a recent pay raise. She has \ncompleted two years of college courses. Applicant and her husband went to great \nefforts and expense to realize their dream of creating the loving and supportive family \nthey have today, and to sustain the health of their three children. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s \nhusband changed jobs and took a deep pay cut to put him on the path toward a more \nlucrative professional future.  \n \nThese endeavors, however, incurred more than transient expenses. Extensive \nmedical bills continue to be incurred for the children. Applicant\u2019s husband needs time to \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nestablish himself in his new line of work and reconsider family financial issues in light of \nhis recent boost in income. Meanwhile, the family continues to rely mainly on \nApplicant\u2019s income, leading her to continue neglecting her delinquent debts. In turn, this \nsituation raises notable security concerns.  \n \nThis process does not require that one satisfy all of one\u2019s delinquent debts. It \ndoes, however, expect one to adopt or devise a workable, realistic strategy for \naddressing such debts, and evidence that such a strategy has been successfully \nimplemented. In simply choosing to let past debts be removed from her credit reports \ndue to extreme age, Applicant has abandoned her financial and legal obligations, and \ndemonstrated poor judgment. Financial counseling, a workable household budget, and \nsome demonstration of attentiveness to her remaining and identifiable financial \nobligations are some of the factors Applicant might wish to revisit in order to dispel \nfinancial considerations security concerns. For now, such security concerns remain \nunmitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

National security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on May 7, 2019. He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 12, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on July \n\n \n2 \n \n \n23, 2019, for a hearing on October 3, 2019, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough I, which were admitted. I kept the record open until October 24, 2019, and \nApplicant timely submitted a packet, which was marked as AE J, and admitted into the \nrecord without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 11, \n2019.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is an employee of a defense contractor. He is single \nand has no children. He attended college for approximately three years but he has not \nobtained an undergraduate degree. He has obtained many certifications during his 17 \nyear career. (AE B, C) He has not served in the military. He has held a security clearance \nsince September 2016. (Tr. 26) He has been employed with his current employer for \nabout three years. (Tr. 26) Applicant acknowledged that he was briefed regarding the use \nof illegal drugs at his various employments. (Tr. 81) \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana infrequently over the course of August \n2000 through July 2018 in his 2018 SCA (SOR 1.a) He obtained a public trust clearance \nsometime in 2016. (GE 1) He was aware of the policy of zero tolerance for drug use.  He \ntestified that he used marijuana in college but he noted that it was infrequently. (Tr. 37) \nHe reports his last use was in July 2018 which was on his birthday. (GE 4) He described \nthe circumstances involving the use of marijuana.  He was at a party and a joint was \npassed around and he took a \u201cpuff.\u201d (Tr. 39) He has never tested positive for a drug test. \nHe signed a letter of intent not to use any illegal drug in the future on October 2, 2019. \n(AE F) He states that he does not associate with the people with whom he previously \nsmoked marijuana. \n \n \nHowever, in his answer to the SOR, he denied the use of marijuana in SOR 1.a \nand 1.b. He stated that the date should have been July 2016 not July 2018, in \ncontradiction to his disclosure in 2018 SCA. At the hearing, he states that it was 2018 for \nhis last use of marijuana. (Tr. 84) He admitted that his denial in his answer was incorrect. \n(Tr. 86) He stated that he was just nervous. In his investigative interview he stated that \nhe could not remember the exact number of times he partook of marijuana while holding \na security clearance. (GE 4) \n \n \nApplicant admits that he was arrested in October 2012 for possession of \nmarijuana-misdemeanor (less than an ounce at a concert). (GE 1, 2) He reports that a \njoint was passed to him and he took a puff. (Tr. 73) He did not purchase the marijuana.  \nThis case was dismissed after completion of 40 hours of community service and is now \nexpunged. (SOR 1.c) Applicant testified at the hearing that his next use was in 2015, not \n2016. (Tr. 83) He stated that he was in a music studio and an associate passed a joint to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhim. (Tr.83) At that time, he was working for a contractor, he knew the use of marijuana \nwas against federal law. (Tr. 84, 92) He disclosed the October 2012 arrest in his July \n2018 SCA. (SOR 1.c) He admits that this was after his eligibility for a public trust position.  \n \n \nIn June 2019, Applicant sought the guidance of a psychologist after receiving the \nSOR. A report reflects that Applicant attends bi-weekly sessions. The report does not \nnote any assessments that were given other than stating that he is amicable and his \ncharacter is nothing short of a psychological profile that any institution would foster the \nopportunity to hire. (AE D) The psychologist directed Applicant to take four drug tests, \nwhich were negative. (AE E) Applicant stated that the doctor did not provide a diagnosis \nor provide any treatment recommendations. The psychologist did not give any \nassessments according to Applicant and did not review the SOR. (Tr.110) \n \n \nApplicant reports that he is a mature man and accepts the responsibility for his \nconduct, and is remorseful. He explained that he would never jeopardize the United \nStates regarding classified information. He just made a mistake. He also explained that \nsince the drug was being decriminalized in D.C, this may have influenced his last use. \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation. Each letter attests to his \nhonesty and trustworthiness. His college friend, a colleague and a minister praise \nApplicant for his professionalism, work ethic and good judgment. The letters describe \nApplicant as a good worker and a good man. (AE J) He also submitted his performance \nevaluations which laud his performance. None of the persons who wrote the character \nletters appear to know about the marijuana use. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n  \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2007 through 2018. When \nhe held a security clearance or a public trust position, he used marijuana. He changed \nhis dates several times during the hearing. He continued his use of marijuana to include \ntaking a puff at a birthday or special occasion.  Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \n \n \n        Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in July 2018. I find that insufficient time has \ntranspired for mitigation in this case given the period of time in his life that he illegally \nused drugs. He did seek help from a counselor and no longer associates with the persons \nwith whom he smoked. He signed a Letter of Intent in 2019. However, his ever-changing \ndates of use listed in his SCA and his answer provide me with great doubts about his \nveracity. I find no mitigation under Guideline H. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is respected by those \nthat know him. He performs well at work.  He has worked at his current employment for \nthree years. He has held a security clearance or public trust position since 2016. He has \nexcellent letters of recommendation. He stated that his last use was in July 2018. He \nsought out a psychologist in June 2019. He has had no positive drug tests. \n \nApplicant admitted his 2012 marijuana arrest and admitted on his SCA use of \nmarijuana from 2000 through 2018. However he kept changing the dates of his use in \n2015 or 2016 with regard to holding a clearance. This is troubling. In his interview in 2018, \nhe stated that he could not provide the number of times that he used marijuana while \nholding a security clearance. (GE 4) He admits that he was anxious and did not want any \nnegative effects on his job or security clearance. Applicant knew it was illegal to use \nmarijuana. He changed the dates of his use at the hearing several times. He tried to \nexplain that he was confused because it was becoming decriminalized in D.C. I did not \nfind his testimony credible, but rather self-serving. This engenders serious questions \nregarding his suitability for a security clearance. I have doubts and questions as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 29, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on April 29, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 24, \n2019.  \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 7, 2019. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE D through F and admitted \nwithout objection. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He worked for a \ncompany from 1986 until he retired in 2017. He has worked for his current employer \nsince then. He also worked a part-time job from 2014 to 2017. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He is divorced with an adult child. (Tr. at 44-46; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nIn 2014, Applicant made an ill-advised decision to invest in real estate and flip \nhouses. He bought a house with the assistance of a company that provides instructions \non how to flip houses. He bought a house that needed repairs for about $82,000. He \nthought he could renovate the house for about $38,000 and sell the house for about \n$145,000. The house needed more repairs than anticipated; the general contractor did \nshoddy work; the house was unable to pass inspections; Applicant was unable to sell \nthe house for what he had invested in it; and it was lost to foreclosure. There is no \nevidence of a deficiency owed on the mortgage loan. (Tr. at 16-28, 37; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant did not fully understand the economics of his investment. He funded \nthe venture with one or more mortgage loans and his personal credit, including credit \ncards. He significantly overextended himself, and a number of debts went unpaid. (Tr. at \n37-44, 47-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the foreclosed investment property and ten delinquent debts \ntotaling about $47,700. Applicant admitted owing all the debts with the exception of the \n$121 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, which he did not recognize. The debts are listed on a \nJuly 2017 credit report, a February 2019 credit report, or both credit reports. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3, 4)  \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in about 2016 to assist him \nin resolving his debts. He enrolled 13 debts, totaling $86,600, in the company\u2019s debt-\nrelief program (DRP). He pays $1,273 into an escrow account each month. He missed \nabout six to nine months of payments to the DRP during a period when he was not \nreceiving overtime hours, but he resumed the payments. The debt-settlement company \nagreed to negotiate settlements with his creditors and use the accumulated funds in the \nescrow account, minus fees, to pay the settlements. (Tr. at 29-30, 46-50; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2; AE-B-F) \n \n \nFour debts with original balances totaling $36,041 were settled for $17,398. \nThese debts were not alleged in the SOR as the settlement payments were completed \nbefore the SOR was issued. A fifth debt with a $500 original balance was settled for \n$322. The settlement payments for this debt were completed before the SOR was \nissued, or shortly thereafter. This debt appears to correspond to the $328 debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.i. (GE 3, 4; AE B, C) \n \n \nThe remaining debts alleged in the SOR are enrolled in the DRP, with the \nexception of the $576 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g and the $121 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j. Applicant admitted owing the $576 debt. He was unsure why it is not in the DRP. He \n\n \n3 \n \nthought he received recent information from the debt-settlement company about the \ndebt. He relies on the debt-settlement company to deal with his creditors, and he stated \nthat the $576 debt will be addressed. He still does not recognize the $121 debt. Five of \nthe debts in the DRP, with original balances totaling $45,847, were settled for $22,102. \nPayments for three of the settled debts are being made. Payments for the last two \nsettled debts have not started yet. Three of the debts in the DRP, with original balances \ntotaling $4,199, have not been settled yet. (Tr. at 52-69; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 3, 4; AE B-F) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are much better. He is receiving retirement pay from \nthe job he held for 31 years. He credibly testified that he will remain in the DRP for the \nadditional approximately two years it will take to settle and pay his remaining debts. He \nis also considering taking out a loan to expedite the process. He realizes that his real \nestate investment was a fiasco. He does not intend to repeat his mistake. (Tr. at 30-32, \n53, 69-76; AE A-F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n4 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a foreclosed mortgage \nloan and delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant made an ill-advised investment in real estate. The house he bought \nneeded more repairs than anticipated; the general contractor did shoddy work; the \nhouse was unable to pass inspections; Applicant was unable to sell the house for what \nhe had invested in it; and it was lost to foreclosure. There is no evidence of a deficiency \nowed on the mortgage loan. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable because the house problems \nwere risks that Applicant assumed when he made the investment. \n \n \nApplicant started addressing his financial problems more than two years before \nthe SOR was issued. He contracted with a debt-settlement company in about 2016 to \nassist him in resolving his debts. Five debts with original balances totaling $36,541 were \nsettled for $17,720. Four of the settled debts were not alleged in the SOR as the \nsettlement payments were completed before the SOR was issued. The fifth debt \nappears to correspond to the $328 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. The remaining debts \nalleged in the SOR are enrolled in the DRP, with the exception of the $576 debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.g and the $121 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. Applicant thought the $576 debt \nwas in the DRP. He does not recognize the $121 debt. He credibly testified that he will \nremain in the DRP until his remaining debts are settled and paid. I am confident he will \nadd the $576 to the DRP or otherwise appropriately address it, and I find the $121 debt \nto be de minimis, and insufficient to affect Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \n\n \n6 \n \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to pay his debts. There \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved and is under control. I find that \nhe has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant action to \nimplement that plan. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She has been employed by a defense contractor as an assistant scientist since August 2018. This is her first application for a security clearance. Applicant used marijuana daily from December 2012 through August 2018. She either smoked it or consumed marijuana concentrates in her home. She described her use as both \u201cmedicinal (not prescribed)\u201d and \u201crecreational.\u201d She maintained that marijuana helped her with \u201csleep, appetite, and various pains such as headaches, stomach aches, and muscle pains.\u201d (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 8) Applicant understands that marijuana use is not compatible with holding a security clearance.

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/28/2019 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 11, \n2018. On April 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 13, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On August 5, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 3. She was given an opportunity to submit a documentary \nresponse setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on August 12, 2019, and did not \n\n \n2 \n \nrespond. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items 2 and 3 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI sua sponte took administrative notice of how the U.S. Department of Justice Drug \nEnforcement Administration (DEA) defined \u201cmarijuana concentrates\u201d in guidance it issued \nin December 2014 (HE I). That definition follows: \n \nA marijuana concentrate is a highly potent THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) \nconcentrated mass that is most similar in appearance to either honey or \nbutter, which is why it is referred to or known on the street as \"honey oil\" \nor \"budder.\" \n \nMarijuana concentrates contain extraordinarily high THC levels that \ncould range from 40 to 80%. This form of marijuana can be up to four \ntimes stronger in THC content than high grade or top shelf marijuana, \nwhich normally measures around 20% THC levels. \n \nI have sua sponte included this DEA guidance in the record as HE I. Because \nthese sua sponte actions did not affect either the relative positions of the parties or my \ndecision, prior notice to the parties was not required. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 26, has cohabited with her fianc\u00e9 since November 2013. She \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. She has been employed by a defense contractor as \nan assistant scientist since August 2018. This is her first application for a security \nclearance.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana daily from December 2012 through August 2018. She \neither smoked it or consumed marijuana concentrates in her home. She described her \nuse as both \u201cmedicinal (not prescribed)\u201d and \u201crecreational.\u201d She maintained that \nmarijuana helped her with \u201csleep, appetite, and various pains such as headaches, \nstomach aches, and muscle pains.\u201d (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 8) \n \nApplicant understands that marijuana use is not compatible with holding a security \nclearance. However, her intent regarding future marijuana use changed during the course \nof the security-clearance investigations process. In her September 2018 SCA, she \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to whether she intended to use marijuana in the future and explained: \n\u201cWhen I no longer have a job that requires a security clearance or a job that is involved \nin public safety, and if I move to a legalized recreational state, I will probably resume \nusage.\u201d She reiterated that response during her November 2018 security-clearance \ninterview (SI). However, in her April 2019 response to Government-issued interrogatories \n(Interrogatory Response), she \u201cemphatically\u201d asserted that she no longer intended to use \nmarijuana in the future due to the \u201cmany improvements\u201d she experienced in her \u201cquality \nof life\u201d during the seven months that she had then abstained from marijuana. She reported \n\n \n3 \n \n\u201cimproved memory and concentration, improved coordination, more motivation, and more \nwilling [sic] to take on responsibility [sic] at work and in the home.\u201d She stated that she \nwas \u201ccommitted to taking any type of drug screening as often as needed.\u201d The record did \nnot specify any drug-screening results. (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 4 and 5) \n \nApplicant primarily obtained the marijuana that she used from her fianc\u00e9 (also a \nmarijuana user), who bought it from his friends. Once she stopped using marijuana, her \nfianc\u00e9 continued to use marijuana, but agreed to cease using it in their home or in her \npresence. In December 2018, her fianc\u00e9 obtained a prescription for medical marijuana \nuse and a state-issued medical marijuana use registry identification card. Before that, his \nmarijuana use was not prescribed. (Item 3 at 4-5) \n \nApplicant was required to list three people \u201cwho know [her] well\u201d on her SCA. She \ndescribed one such individual as a friend and former work associate (Friend). During her  \nNovember 2018 SI, Applicant revealed that she sold her fianc\u00e9\u2019s marijuana concentrate \nto Friend three to five times in 2017. On these occasions, she gave her fianc\u00e9 the money \nshe received from Friend, who then gave it to a third party. She agreed to sell to Friend \nbecause he was \u201ca friend who would provide her marijuana,\u201d and was unable to acquire \nany on his own at the time. She acknowledged only one occasion in 2017 when she \nbought marijuana from Friend. Applicant does not intend to either buy or sell marijuana in \nthe future. (Item 2 at 16 and 22; Item 3 at 4-6) \n \nApplicant identified two of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s friends with whom she had previously \nsmoked marijuana. She did not specify whether these were the same friends from whom \nher fianc\u00e9 bought marijuana. As of November 2018, she had stopped socializing \u201cin \nperson\u201d with them while they were using marijuana, but continued socializing \u201conline\u201d with \nthem for the purpose of playing video games. In April 2019, she maintained that she had \n\u201ccut all forms of contact/not met up with\u201d them or Friend, except for an exchange she had \nwith Friend about a job opportunity. That exchange did not take place in person. (Item 3 \nat 4 and 6) \n \n       Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n\n \n5 \n \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s use, sale, and purchase of marijuana establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \n \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant used marijuana daily for nearly six years. She discontinued her use \nmerely fourteen months ago when she applied for a security clearance. She illegally \npurchased and sold marijuana on multiple occasions. Despite earlier statements to the \ncontrary, she professed a sincere intent never to use marijuana again after experiencing \npositive benefits from abstention. However, she did not provide the signed statement of \nintent described in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). She also did not establish a sufficient pattern of \nabstinence in light of the recency and circumstances of her use, particularly given her \nfianc\u00e9\u2019s continued prescribed marijuana use. At this time, I am unable to conclude that \nher marijuana use is unlikely to recur and have doubts about her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \n\n \n6 \n \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her use, sale, and purchase of marijuana. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/27/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) on February 24, 2016 \n(SCA 1) and April 18, 2017 (SCA 2). On May 1, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 17, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On July 9, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary \nresponse setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on July 18, 2019, and did not respond. \n\n \n2 \n \nItem 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 7 are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 60, is divorced and has no children. He served in the U.S. Marine \nCorps from 1977 through 1981, when he received an honorable discharge. He earned an \nassociate degree in 1996. He has been employed as a sensors and systems technician \nby a defense contractor since 2014. (Items 2, 3) \n \nApplicant was granted DOD security clearances in 1983 and 2016. He maintained \nan interim clearance during the adjudication of the background investigation initiated by \nSCA 1, which began in March 2016 and concluded in September 2016. In October 2016, \nthe DOD CAF granted him a final clearance after concluding that he mitigated the \npersonal conduct, financial considerations, and criminal conduct concerns raised by SCA \n1. In February 2017, the DOD CAF requested that Applicant complete SCA 2 in \nconnection with its investigation focused on the concerns raised by a January 2017 \nincident report about an October 2016 driving under the influence (DUI) charge. Applicant \nsubmitted SCA 2 in April 2017. That investigation, which concluded in December 2018, \nresulted in the SOR, which was referred to this office for final adjudication. (Item 2 at 35; \nItem 3 at 38-39; Item 5 at 6-7; Items 6 and 7) \n \nThe SOR alleged Guideline H and E concerns involving Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana and other illegal drugs, including while he served in the Marine Corps and also \nwhile he possessed a security clearance. It also alleged Guideline E concerns involving \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate SCA falsifications, excessive alcohol consumption, and a 2012 \nassault charge.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use began in 1974 at age 15. He used it three times during \nhigh school. He began smoking marijuana on a daily basis when he joined the Marine \nCorps in 1977 at age 18. His marijuana use continued through at least February 24, 2017 \nat age 57 (except for one six-month period of abstinence noted below). The amount of \nhis daily marijuana consumption varied over those years, as follows: 1) five to six joints \n(1977 through 1979); 2) a \u201ccouple of hits\u201d (1979 through 1980), which was during a time \nwhen his marijuana supply was limited while stationed overseas; 3) five to six joints (1980 \nthrough 1981); 4) three to four joints (1981 through 1995); 5) two joints (1995 through \n2012); and 5) four to five joints (2012 through February 2017). Between 1977 and \nFebruary 2017, he had abstained from his daily marijuana use only one time: an \nunspecified period of six months sometime during his marriage (between 1980 and 1987), \nwhen his then wife dared him to stop. Applicant acknowledged that he purchased \nmarijuana from unspecified friends, but denied ever selling it. (Item 2 at 24; Item 4 at 5, \n16, 18) \n \n \nApplicant used other illegal drugs at various times. In 1978 at age 19, he consumed \namphetamines twice: by taking a methamphetamine (speed) pill once, and by smoking \ncrystal methamphetamine once. He consumed lysergic acid diethylamide (acid) on four \noccasions in 1979 at age 20, and then one time in 1995 at age 36. Between 1979 (age \n\n \n3 \n \n20) and 2006 (age 37), he used cocaine six times. In 2012 at age 53, he tried heroin on \none occasion to see what it was about since his girlfriend was abusing it at the time. (Item \n4 at 16; Item 5 at 8) \n \n \nIn 2012, Applicant kneed his girlfriend in the back for which he was charged with \nfelony assault with a dangerous weapon. After he pled guilty to the reduced charge of \nmisdemeanor simple assault, he was sentenced to one year of probation and fined $600. \nHis girlfriend was also granted a one-year order of protection against him. He successfully \ncomplied with the terms of his probation and the protective order. After the order expired, \nhe resumed the relationship with his girlfriend, which continued through at least August \n2018. This is the same girlfriend from whom Applicant obtained heroin. (Item 2 at 30-32; \nItem 3 at 30-32; Item 4 at 9, 16, 24, 25; Item 5 at 5) \n \n \nIn October 2016, Applicant drove under the influence of marijuana. After the police \nofficer who stopped him for a traffic violation smelled marijuana emanating from \nApplicant\u2019s car, he was issued a field sobriety test, which he failed. The officer also found \nthe remains of four previously-smoked marijuana joints in the driver\u2019s side door. Applicant \ndenied smoking marijuana while he was driving, but admitted that he had smoked it while \nparked in his car three hours prior to driving. His blood sample tested positive for \nmarijuana. He was arrested and spent one night in jail. Applicant pled guilty to \nmisdemeanor DUI of marijuana for which he was accepted into a first-time offenders pre-\ntrial intervention program, consisting of six months of probation and an $1,800 fine. His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for two months. He was ordered to complete 24 hours of \ncommunity service, take DUI classes, and attend drug and alcohol treatment. He \nsuccessfully completed the program, which qualified him for a dismissal of the DUI \ncharge. (Item 3 at 29, 32-33; Item 5 at 5-6)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s court-ordered treatment consisted of a drug and alcohol evaluation, \nseven individual therapy sessions, and an unspecified number of group therapy sessions \nthat he attended twice per week. He entered the program on March 3, 2017 with a \ndiagnosis of cannabis use disorder, severe (based on DSM-5 criteria). Applicant was \ndischarged from treatment in October 2017, as planned, upon completion of his stated \ngoal: \u201cI want to not use marijuana for at least the next 7 years until I retire.\u201d His counselor \nnoted Applicant\u2019s expressed intent to remain clean and sober and that, during the course \nof his treatment, he was an active participant and remained highly motivated. The \ntreatment records reflected a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder, in early remission, at \ndischarge, but did not specify a prognosis from his counselor. Nor did they articulate a \nspecific aftercare plan beyond referring various resources for Applicant to use as needed. \n(Item 4 at 1, 3, 4, 14, 20, 22, 29-44) \n \n \nDuring his initial intake on March 3, 2017, Applicant tested positive for marijuana, \nwhich Applicant acknowledged he had used seven days prior. He told his counselor that \nhe did not stop using marijuana after his DUI until the day he received an unspecified \nletter from the court on February 24, 2017, because he really enjoyed marijuana. \nAccording to treatment records, Applicant reportedly abstained from drugs and alcohol \nthroughout the course of his treatment and passed each of the seven drug tests to which \nhe was subjected. However, beginning with his first treatment session on June 2, 2017 \n\n \n4 \n \nand continuing through the last one on September 22, 2017, he reported his last \nmarijuana use as March 16, 2017, which together with other record evidence (discussed \nbelow) reveals that he used marijuana at least once during the interim period between his \ninitial intake on March 3, 2017 and the day his treatment began on June 2, 2017. There \nis no record evidence that Applicant was subjected to any drug testing during that interim \nperiod or to explain the reason for the delay in him commencing treatment after intake. \n(Item 4 at 13, 16, 29-44)  \n \nDuring his initial intake, Applicant revealed that he routinely smoked marijuana in \nhis car while driving. His stated triggers for marijuana use relapse included stress, his \nbandmates, and playing gigs. He reported that he regularly drove under the influence \nafter consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. He acknowledged that, on each occasion \nthat he chose to drive, he knew he should not have been driving because he was \n\u201chammered.\u201d (Item 1 at 5, 8; Item 4 at 16-18)   \n \nApplicant tested positive on an alcohol screening test administered during \ntreatment, which raised concerns about his alcohol use. However, Applicant declined \nreferral for an alcohol-use assessment. He was advised to abstain from drinking alcohol \nand to undergo an alcohol screening test annually. His counselor reviewed the specific \nhealth issues and risks that underscored the abstention recommendation. Applicant \nreportedly abstained from alcohol use during treatment. (Item 4 at 1, 43-44) \n \n \nDuring the security clearance investigations process, Applicant was not \nforthcoming about his marijuana and other drug use. He answered \u201cno\u201d to each of the \nquestions in section 23 about illegal use of drugs or drug activity on SCA 1, and otherwise \nfailed to disclose therein his reportable marijuana use or that he used marijuana and other \nillegal drugs while in possession of his 1983 security clearance. On SCA 2, he reported \nthe following in response to questions in section 23 about his marijuana use: 1) that he \nonly used marijuana between October 2016 and March 2017, including while he \npossessed his 2016 security clearance; 2) that he purchased marijuana every 2 weeks \nduring that period; and 3) that he only smoked about two joints per day (to relieve stress \nand boredom). However, he otherwise failed to disclose on SCA 2 his other reportable \nmarijuana use. (Item 2 at 33-34; Item 3 at 34-35) \n \nApplicant was interviewed in August 2018 about SCA 1. There is no information in \nthe record to explain why SCA 2 was not also discussed. During the interview, Applicant \nadmitted using marijuana \u201con and off over the decades\u201d beginning in the 1970s. He \nasserted that his most recent use occurred between September 2016 and March 2017, \nduring which time he smoked at least one joint a day (about 3 grams per day), while he \npossessed a security clearance. He averred that he \u201cbegan smoking [marijuana] again\u201d \nin September 2016 because his friends were doing so, and that he stopped smoking it \nafter his court date in March 2017. He did not enumerate the specific day during the \ninterview. However, he did report the date as March 28, 2017 in SCA 2. (Item 3 at 30, 32; \nItem 5 at 6) \n \nApplicant maintained that he did not intentionally falsify SCA 1 and claimed that he \ndid not list his marijuana and other drug use on SCA 1 because: 1) his recent marijuana \n\n \n5 \n \nuse occurred after he completed SCA 1, 2) he had forgotten about his heroin use, and 3) \nhis other drug use occurred more than seven years prior. In April 2019, Applicant verified \nthe accuracy of the facts and circumstances he reported about his marijuana use during \nthe interview. (Item 5 at 6, 9, 11, and 12) \n \nApplicant attributed his marijuana use primarily to stress, boredom, and being a \nmember in a band; and his other drug use to experimentation. Applicant has played in a \nrock band since at least 1992. On SCA 1 and SCA 2, he identified three of his bandmates \nas people who knew him well in section 16 and used two of them as references in other \nsections. He acknowledged that his bandmates used marijuana, but denied being \ntempted to use it himself when he is around them. (Item 2 at 7, 10, 22-23; Item 3 at 9, 20-\n22, 35; Item 4 at 12, 17, 39; Item 5 at 6, 8-9)  \n \nAs of August 2018, Applicant continued to associate with unspecified individuals \nwho use marijuana (because everyone he knows uses it), but not with individuals who \nuse other illegal drugs. His girlfriend had actively sought help with her drug addiction and \nwas committed to a sober lifestyle. Applicant was regularly exposed to marijuana use, but \ninsisted that he was also committed to a sober lifestyle and had no future intent to resume \nusing marijuana because he did not want to lose his job. (Item 5 at 6 and 9) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. alleged \u201cYou have routinely used marijuana while driving,\u201d to which \nApplicant answered: \u201cI admit . . . I have routinely used marijuana while driving.\u201d  SOR \u00b6 \n2.d alleged \u201cAs of your 2017 treatment . . . you were admittedly binge drinking and driving \nabout twice a month,\u201d to which Applicant answered \u201cI deny . . . I drink twice a month, not \nalways binge drinking, usually about 2 or 3, occasionally more. I do not drive until 3 hours \nafter drinking . . .\u201d In the closing paragraph of Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he stated the \nfollowing: \u201cI admit to liking smoking marijuana occasionally\u201d and \u201cI dislike all other drugs.\u201d \nHe did not explicitly address therein whether he had maintained his marijuana sobriety \nsince March 2017. (Item 1 at 5, 8) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \n\n \n7 \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nThe facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana and other drug \nuse establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of substance use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant has a 40-year history of heavy marijuana use. He smoked it on a daily \nbasis from 1977 through at least February 24, 2017 (except for one six-month period in \nthe 1980s), including while he served in the Marine Corps and also while he possessed \na security clearance. Applicant routinely chose to smoke marijuana in his car while \ndriving. He not only failed to stop using marijuana immediately after his 2016 DUI, but he \nused it on at least one occasion after the March 3, 2017 initial intake for his court-ordered \ntreatment program.  \n \nApplicant is credited with successfully completing treatment in October 2017, when \nhis severe substance-use disorder was in early remission. However, he failed to establish \na sufficient pattern of abstinence. He continues to associate with marijuana users and be \nregularly exposed to marijuana use. Not only am I unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use is not likely to recur, but he failed to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinuing his marijuana use. Specifically, his SOR answer contains statements (noted \nin the findings of fact) which suggest he may have resumed his marijuana use, or at the \nvery least, calls into question his ongoing commitment to sobriety. While his experimental \nuse of other drugs was isolated and unlikely to recur, the fact that he tried heroin at age \n53 and used other drugs while in the Marine Corps undercuts mitigation. The facts and \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana and other drug use raise substantial \ndoubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nThe above-stated general concern is established by Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of \nquestionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. He was a \nheavy user of marijuana for at least 40 years, including while holding a security clearance \nand while in the Marine Corps. He was not forthcoming about his drug-use history during \nthe security clearance investigations process. At age 53, he chose to try heroin for the \nfirst time. He assaulted his girlfriend in 2012. He routinely drove under the influence of \nmarijuana and alcohol. These facts also establish the following specific disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time of the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \nAn applicant\u2019s education and experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to \ndisclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) \n \nApplicant had a lengthy history of heavy marijuana use, including during the seven \nyears reportable on SCA 1 and SCA 2. I did not find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations and \nexcuses for his failure to accurately report that history on SCA 2, and for his failure to \nreport any of his drug use on SCA 1. His continued lack of candor during the August 2018 \ninterview and in his SOR answer suggests that he was aware of the potentially negative \nimpact his drug use could have on his security clearance. Accordingly, I find substantial \nevidence of an intent on the part of Applicant to omit and conceal materially relevant \ninformation from SCA 1 and SCA 2. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established.  \n \nNone of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline \nare fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \n\n \n10 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting \na security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the honesty of the \napplicant. The Appeal Board has stressed the importance of providing full and frank \nanswers on the SCA:  \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That \ncompelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in being \nable to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the \ngovernment in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of heavy marijuana use spans 40 years. His deliberate lack of \ncandor during the security clearance investigations process is particularly egregious given \nthat he was granted a security clearance in 2016 based on a falsified SCA 1. While I do \nnot consider any domestic assault to be a minor offense, given that it resulted from \nisolated circumstances that are unlikely to recur, it arguably could lack security \nsignificance if viewed in isolation. However, together with the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding his marijuana and other drug use and his history of routinely driving under \nthe influence of marijuana and alcohol, it underscores a well-established pattern of \nquestionable judgment that also calls into question his ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. Applicant failed to demonstrate a sufficient pattern of \nresponsible behavior for me to conclude that this questionable judgment is behind him. I \nhave serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \n\n \n11 \n \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his 40-year history of heavy marijuana use, including while holding a \nsecurity clearance, and his lack of candor about it during the security clearance \ninvestigations process. His frequent use of marijuana and experimentation with other \nillegal drugs while in the Marine Corps, together with his pattern of other questionable \njudgment, further underscores these concerns. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.f:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) and it was received by Applicant on June \n26, 2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \n\n \n2 \n \n \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 4. Applicant provided a response \nto the FORM with an additional document that is marked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There \nwas no objection to any of the evidence, and Items 1 through 4 and AE A are admitted. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 29, 2019.  \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nIn the FORM Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts about Afghanistan (Item 5). Applicant did not object, and I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported by source \ndocuments from official U.S. Government publications and those that were provided with \nthe FORM. The facts are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e and 1.g. He denied \nthe SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.h and 1.i.  After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He is a high school graduate \nand earned two vocational certificates. He was granted a special immigration visa in 2009 \nfor his work with the United States Forces in Afghanistan. He immigrated to the United \nStates in 2009 and became a naturalized citizen in June 2014. Applicant married in 2004. \nHe has three children, ages 12, 10, and 4 years old. His wife is a citizen of Afghanistan \nand a permanent resident of the United States. Applicant stated that his wife intends to \napply for U.S. citizenship. His two eldest sons became naturalized citizens of the United \nStates in 2014, and his youngest child was born in the United States and is a citizen. \nApplicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that his wife and children reside in the United \nStates and have no intention of returning to Afghanistan in the foreseeable future. (Items \n1, 2; AE A) \n \nApplicant disclosed in his answer to the SOR that he previously worked as a \nlinguist in Afghanistan for the U.S. Government and military from 2003 to 2009. It was this \nservice that made him eligible for a special immigration visa. After he immigrated, he \nreturned to Afghanistan and worked from 2010 to 2013 for the U.S. military as a linguist. \nApplicant disclosed in his security clearance application (SCA) that he has been working \nin Afghanistan as a linguist for a federal contractor since January 2015 to the present. \n(Items 1, 2; AE A) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, three brothers, three sisters, and two brothers-in-law \nare citizens and residents of Afghanistan. He stated that in 2016, he applied for an \nimmigration visa to the United States for his mother, but because a request for information \nwas sent to his U.S. address and he was serving in Afghanistan, he never received it, \nand the visa was denied. His mother remains in Afghanistan. She is a housewife. His \nfather is a retired laborer/farmer. In the past, Applicant provided his parents some \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfinancial support. At that time, his mother had cancer, and has since recovered. He no \nlonger provides his parents financial support, but does give them gifts for special \noccasions and holidays. His parents are now financially supported by Applicant\u2019s \nbrothers. (Item 1; AE A)  \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers is a dentist, another owns a cell phone store, and the \nyoungest is a university student. At one time, Applicant provided his brothers financial \nsupport. He no longer provides support. He does send monetary gifts for special \noccasions and holidays. (Item 1; AE A)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s three sisters are married and housewives. He does not provide them \nfinancial support and he does not have regular contact with them since they married. \n(Item 1; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s said that he does not have regular contact with one brother-in-law and \ndoes not provide him any financial support. The other brother-in-law, who previously \nworked for the National Directorate of Intelligence, is now retired. Applicant indicated his \nbrother-in-law was a clerk. He stated that he has contact with him once or twice a year \nand has not seen him in person for years. (Item 1; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he has not had in-person contact with any family member in \nAfghanistan since 2013. In his February 2018 background interview, he stated that he \nmaintains contact with his parents. He also has regular contact with his oldest brother \nthrough Facebook and telephonically. He has contact once or twice a month with his other \nbrothers. He has not disclosed to his family in Afghanistan what he does or for whom he \nworks. None of his relatives are affiliated with the Afghan government. (Item 3; AE A)  \nApplicant does not have any financial interests in Afghanistan. He owns two \nhouses in the United States. He lives in one and rents the other. Applicant indicated to \nthe government investigator that he follows all appropriate security procedures and those \nrelated to contact with foreign nationals. He has not been threatened, put under duress, \nor blackmailed because of his family in Afghanistan. There have been no threats to induce \nApplicant to cooperate with foreign entities. His family is unaware that he is undergoing \nconsideration for obtaining a security clearance with the U.S. Government. He believes \nthey would be supportive if they knew. He stated: \u201call of my adult life I have been working \nfor the U.S. and I will continue to work with honesty and integrity for the U.S. Government.\u201d \n(Items 1, 3; AE A)  \nAfghanistan \n \nThe United States Department of State\u2019s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in \neffect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and \nthreats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel there is unsafe due to \nongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, suicide bombings, and insurgent \n\n \n4 \n \n \nattacks. These attacks may also target Afghan and U.S. Government convoys and \ncompounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.  \nExtremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and \nSyria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the \ncountry. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan, coalition forces, and U.S. targets \nwith little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties. Due to security \nconcerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and their family \nmembers is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department.  \n \nAfghanistan continues to experience aggressive and coordinated attacks by \ndifferent terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number \nof high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government \ntargets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan \ninterests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists. \nThe Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region. \n \n \nThe State Department\u2019s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was \nwidespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons \naffiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the \nrule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There \nwas also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.  \n \n \nAfghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against \nterrorism, working with the U.S. to eliminate terrorist groups. The U.S. Government \ncontinues to invest resources to help Afghanistan improve its security, governance, \ninstitutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with \nthe Afghan government. \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nAfghanistan. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, \nboth directly and through his family members living in Afghanistan. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 8 is potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Afghanistan. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who worked for the United States Government and \nmilitary from 2003 to 2009. Because of his dedicated service he was granted a special \n\n \n7 \n \n \nimmigration visa and immigrated to the United States in 2009. From 2010 through 2013, \nhe worked to Afghanistan in support of the U.S. Government and military. In 2014, he \nbecame a naturalized citizen and from2015 to the present, he has served in Afghanistan \nas a linguist. Applicant did not provide any specific evidence that he served under \ndangerous conditions, but it is likely that in his position as a linguist, the lengthy periods \nhe served, and the generally dangerous environment of Afghanistan that his service had \nelements of danger in support of the national defense. He stated that: \u201call of my adult life \nI have been working for the U.S. and I will continue to work with honesty and integrity for \nthe U.S. Government.\u201d Based on his long history of service, I find his statement credible. \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family of his wife and three children live in the United States. His \nthree children are U.S. citizens and his wife is a permanent resident. Applicant owns two \nhouses in the United States. I find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. Government and military from 2003 to 2009 in \nAfghanistan earned him a special immigrant visa. He returned to Afghanistan as a linguist \nfrom 2010 to 2013. He became a naturalized citizen in 2014 and returned as a linguist to \nAfghanistan in 2015 where he continues to work to the present. He has spent \napproximately 13 years and most of his adult life working for the United States \nGovernment and military. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record \nof action in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable \n\n \n8 \n \n \nresult for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n20, 2007). The complicated state of affairs in Afghanistan places a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his foreign family members do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. He has met that burden.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe foreign influence security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n_____________________________\nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 2, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 22, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on June, 20, \n2019. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 5. Applicant was \n\n \n2 \n \n \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not provide a response \nto the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. Items 1 through \n5 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on August 7, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. She is a high school graduate. She married in 1996 and \ndivorced in 2000. She has a 22-year-old child from the marriage. In 2002, she began a \ncivil union and has two children from the union. They are 16 and 9 years old. Applicant \nwas employed from September 2009 to July 2018. She left that job and has been \nemployed by a federal contractor since July 2018. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2018. In it \nshe disclosed she had numerous delinquent debts that had been turned over to collection \nagencies. She stated:  \n \nI had over extended myself in credit card debt. I had been struggling to pay \nat least the minimum credit card payments up until 2017. In 2017 my \nhusband didn\u2019t receive any income for approx[imately] 3-4 months and at \nthe time I became so behind on the credit cards bills, other bills, and the \nminimum payments became so large that I was unable to pay. (Item 2)  \n \nShe further stated that she had been working with the collection agencies to pay off the \ndebts and was making monthly payments on many of the delinquent debts. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2018. She \nconfirmed her delinquent debts and reiterated she was making monthly payments on \nmany of them. She explained that the reason for her delinquent debt was because she \nwas overextending herself by shopping at retail stores and her husband\u2019s unemployment \nat the time. She believed her financial situation was improving with her new job. She \nstated that she will no longer use credit cards. She did not participate in financial \ncounseling. She did not provide supporting documents to corroborate that she is making \nmonthly payments on her delinquent debts. She did not provide information about her \ncurrent financial situation or a budget. (Item 3)  \n \n \nCredit reports from October 2017 and May 2019 corroborate the delinquent debts. \nA review of the May 2019 credit report shows that the collection account alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c ($1,968) has a reduced balance of $1,480 that is past due. The credit report states \nthat there is a partial payment agreement in place and the last payment made was $70 in \nApril 2019. (Items 4, 5) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant stated in her SCA that she had made a payment arrangement for the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($4,125). She was to make monthly payments of $125. Her 2017 and \n2019 credit reports do not reflect any payments being made and the debt remains in \ncollection. (Items 2, 4, 5) \n \n \nApplicant stated in her SCA that she negotiated a payment plan of $150 a month \nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($4,677). Her 2019 credit report shows a reduced balance, but \nthe debt is still past due. It shows she last made a payment in March 2019. It appears she \nis paying the debt, but she failed to provide additional documents to show more recent \npayments. (Items 2, 4, 5) \n \n \nThere is no evidence that the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,660) is being \npaid. There is no evidence that the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,007) is being paid. \n(Items 4, 5) \n \n \nThe 2019 credit bureau report shows that the charged-off account in SOR \u00b6 1.f \n($500) was paid in approximately February 2019. (Item 5)  \n \nThe collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($4,538) shows a reduced balance in the May \n2019 credit report ($3,804). It also indicated the last payment made was in March 2019. \nIt appears Applicant is paying this debt, but she failed to provide additional documents to \nshow more recent payments. (Items 2, 4, 5)  \n \nThe collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,822) shows a reduced balance in the May \n2019 credit report ($1,114). It indicated the last payment made was in March 2019. The \ncollection account in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,707) shows a reduced balance in the May 2019 credit \nreport ($1,407) and it indicated the last payment made was in March 2019. The collection \naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,050) shows a reduced balance in the May 2019 credit report \n($633) and the last payment was in March 2019. The collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.k \n($721) reflects a zero balance in the May 2019 credit report and indicated the last \npayment was in March 2019.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had approximately $23,775 of delinquent debts, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.k. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in her SCA that she was making monthly payments on some of \nher delinquent debts. She did not provide documents to corroborate she has payment \nagreements with her creditors, except a partial agreement with one creditor, or proof of \nconsistent payments she may have made, or that any of the debts are resolved. It appears \nfrom her May 2019 credit report that the balances on some of her debts have been \nreduced, and it also shows a last payment of March 2019 on some debts. There are also \ncollection accounts that are alleged in the SOR that show the debts remain unpaid. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts remain recent. She did not provide evidence that her financial problems \nare unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant stated in her SCA that she overextended her use of credit cards and her \nhusband was unemployed for several months. Her husband\u2019s unemployment was beyond \nher control. Her use of her credit cards was within her control. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. Applicant did not provided sufficient \nevidence to show she has acted responsibly under the circumstances. I have considered \nthe information on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, but without additional information, such as \nwhen Applicant began making payments towards her delinquent debts; whether she has \npayment agreements with creditors; whether her payments are consistent; and her overall \nfinancial situation, I am unable to determine if she acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) has only \npartial application.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling. She has \ndelinquent debts that she has not addressed. She did not provide information about her \ncurrent finances or budget. There is some evidence that Applicant has made payments \non some of her delinquent accounts. She did not provide amplifying information on when \nshe began making payments; whether the payments were consistent; or whether she has \npayment or settlement arrangements with any of the creditors. Although she is credited \nwith reducing the balances for some of the alleged debts in the SOR, there are other \ndelinquent debts that have not been addressed. I am unable to conclude at this time that \nthere are clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. The evidence supports partial application of AG \u00b6 \n20(d) regarding the debts that show a reduced balance, but I am unable to conclude that \nshe is adhering to a plan because she failed to provide evidence regarding such.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. I have considered that according to Applicant\u2019s May 2019 \ncredit report some of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR show a reduced balance \nand that a payment was made in March 2019. Other debts remain unpaid. Applicant did \nnot provide corroborating documentary evidence to show her current financial state; \nwhether she made consistent payments to creditors; or that she has payment agreements \nwith creditors. Although it appears she is reducing her debt, at this time she has not met \nher burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nor after June 8, 2017. In a response dated May 9, 2019, Applicant admitted five of the \nsix allegations raised, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was assigned this case on July 9, \n2019. On July 24, 2019, a notice was issued setting the hearing for September 10, \n2019. The hearing commenced as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered three documents, which were accepted into the record \nwithout objection as Government exhibits (Exs.) 1-3. Applicant gave testimony, \nintroduced two witnesses, and offered three items, which were accepted into the record \nwithout objection as Exs. A-C. A transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on \nSeptember 19, 2019, and the record was closed.  After my review of the record as a \nwhole, and in light of the applicable directive, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate \nforeign influence security concerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n  Request for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). The request was offered \nas Government Ex. 2. Applicant did not object to its admission. I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported by source \ndocuments from official U.S. Government publications, and similar information set forth \nin recent DOHA decisions regarding China. The facts considered include, but are not \nlimited to, the following: \n \nChina has an authoritarian government, dominated by its Communist Party. It \nhas a poor human rights record. China suppresses political dissent, engages in arbitrary \narrests and detentions, forced confessions, torture, mistreatment of prisoners, and \nreligious suppression.  \n \nChina is the world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrator of economic \nespionage. It is among the most aggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected \nU.S. technology, as well as military and economic intelligence. China targets the United \nStates with active intelligence-gathering programs, both legal and illegal. Its focus is on \nobtaining information and technologies from the United States that could be beneficial to \nChina\u2019s military modernization and economic development.  \n \nChina\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, \nfrequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can \nuse their insider access at work to steal trade secrets, often using removable media \ndevices or e-mail. Recent cases involving actual or attempted espionage by China \nagainst the United States, as well as incidents involving the illegal export of sensitive \ntechnology to China, exist.  \n \nIn China, authorities routinely monitor telephone conversations, facsimile \ntransmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet communications. Authorities open \nand censor mail. Its security services have entered personal residences and offices to \ngain access to computers, telephones and fax machines. Hotel guest rooms are \nsometimes bugged and searched for sensitive or proprietary materials. The U.S. State \nDepartment warns that United States citizens have been interrogated or detained for \nreasons stated to be related to \u201cstate security\u201d whilst in China. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old woman who was born and raised in China, where she \nearned the equivalent of a medical degree. Married in 1992, she had a child about three \nyears later. Applicant and her child followed her husband to the United States in 1999 \nafter he received a work visa. Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen in \n2012. Shortly thereafter, she found a contractor position aiding in government medical \nresearch. Applicant was ultimately vetted and awarded clearance for a public trust \nposition. She has been a research associate at her present place of business for about \nseven years.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has never owned real property in a foreign country. She has received \nno form of social security or government aid from China as a result of her birth or \nperiods of employment in China. Applicant visited China in 2018 and 2019. (Tr. 28)  \n \nThe circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s kin in China, for the most part, have \nbeen the same for several years. Relatives remaining in China as citizens and residents \ninclude her retired public school teacher mother, who receives a government pension, \nand her retired private school teacher father, who suffers from dementia. (Tr. 32, 56) \nNeither parent ever performed military service in China. Applicant also has two siblings \nwho work for private institutions. (Tr. 35) Her parents-in-law are retired from work in the \nprivate sector. Applicant\u2019s niece is still a citizen of China, but is currently living in the \nUnited States with a green card status. (Tr. 41) Overall, Applicant describes these \nindividuals as \u201cvery normal people\u201d with no interest in her work. (Tr. 55-56) \n \nApplicant sends her parents nominal amounts of money to encourage them to \ntake and enjoy vacations. Applicant maintains relations with her parents and siblings \nthrough various communicative Internet-based social media, which permits her to \n\u201cconnect, not really talk.\u201d (Tr. 38) Annually, they speak by telephone to honor the New \nYear.  Applicant and her husband maintain minimal contact with his parents. (Tr. 39)  \n \nA scientist, Applicant\u2019s husband previously worked for the United States \ngovernment. (Tr. 21) He has no criminal background. (Ex. A) In 2018, he began working \nin senior management for a small company incorporated in the United States. (Tr. 22) \nThis has added to the foreign influence concerns previously examined regarding \nApplicant. (Tr. 58-59) The company\u2019s owner lives in the United States, but Applicant is \nunsure whether the owner is a U.S. citizen. It is unknown whether the company has a \nnexus with the Chinese government. (Tr. 28) In June 2018, Applicant\u2019s husband was \nsent to China to work for the company because: \u201cthey are bringing some work in China. \nSo, they need their people to monitor the work, so that\u2019s why he was sent there.\u201d (Tr. \n24-25) The work at issue appears to be medical in nature.   \n \nFor an unknown reason, the head of the company is unable to come and go \nfreely through China. Therefore, the owner wants Applicant\u2019s husband to act on his \nbehalf. (Tr. 25-26) Such work is in collaboration with a pharmaceutical lab that is at least \npartly Chinese. (Tr. 26). In China, the husband rents a dwelling and maintains a \npersonal bank account. Applicant does not know the sum maintained in this foreign \naccount, but most or all of his regular pay check is deposited in their joint account in the \nUnited States. At present, the company owner is looking for a collaborator from another \npart of the world. (Tr. 29) It is presently unknown whether the husband will remain in \nChina, return to the United States, or follow the company elsewhere. (Tr. 29, 44) \n \nIn the United States, Applicant and her husband own their own home. It was \nbought for $540,000 and there is a mortgage balance currently of about $400,000. Their \nchild is enrolled in graduate school with plans to pursue a doctoral degree in this \ncountry. Applicant personally maintains a retirement account and a bank account in the \nUnited States, amounting to about $60,000; she has no other financial investments. (Tr. \n45) Her husband also has a retirement account in this country. Applicant participates in \nvarious community activities, including a local dance and exercise class.  \n\n \n \n4 \n \nNow retired, Applicant\u2019s former supervisor found Applicant to be a stellar \nperformer, quick study, and popular colleague. (Tr. 49-51) She far outperformed the \nsupervisor\u2019s initial expectations. She held a public trust position while working under him \nwithout adverse incident for many years. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor is eager to \nelevate Applicant and better utilize her many talents by moving her from a research \nassociate to a principal investigator position. (Tr. 55)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under the AG, the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence that transcends beyond \nnormal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in \nthose to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may fail to safeguard such information. \nThe denial of a security clearance is in no way suggestive that an applicant is anything \nless than a loyal citizen. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder the AG, foreign contact and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U. S. interests or \notherwise be made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \n\n \n \n5 \n \nAssessment of foreign contact and interests should consider the country (China) in \nwhich the foreign contact or interest is included.  \n \n \nThe AG lists nine available disqualifying conditions. Given that Applicant has \nmultiple members of her family with ties to China due to residency, citizenry, or both, I \nfind the following apply:  \n \n\u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand  \n \n\u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \n \nUnder \u00b6 8, two mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n  \n\u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n\u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nAs a threshold issue, I note that China has an authoritarian government \ndominated by its Communist Party. It is the world\u2019s most active and aggressive \nperpetrator of economic espionage, particularly with regard to its pursuit of sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology and both U.S. military and economic intelligence. It is known \nto specifically target the United States with its intelligence-gathering programs. Both its \ngovernment and private entities within its borders are known to exploit Chinese citizens \nand those with family ties to China in order to gain access to trade secrets and other \nprotected information of U.S. origin. Human rights violations and suppression of \nreligious freedom is common. China is known to monitor various forms of \ncommunication, including those made via the Internet. Consequently, heightened \nscrutiny is warranted in this matter.  \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant is caring daughter, sister, and daughter-in-law. She maintains \ncommunication with her family in China in varying degrees, and she has visited China \ntwice in the past two years. The recent relocation of her husband to China has added \nfresh security concerns with regard to Applicant\u2019s family ties within the Chinese border. \nThose concerns are heightened because China\u2019s aggressive economic espionage and \nexploitation of its own citizens is well documented, and its monitoring of U.S. citizens is \nwell known. Although most of Applicant\u2019s relatives were formerly vetted in terms of \nApplicant\u2019s application for a public trust position, the return of Applicant\u2019s husband to \nChina for work adds a new dimension of concern. Such conditions obviate application of \n\u00b6 8(a). \n \n \nMoreover, Applicant stresses that her own life is tethered directly to the United \nStates, where she enjoys her work, is part of her community, and continues her \nrelationship with her child. In terms of assets, what she has is located here in the United \nStates. The one thing deviating from this U.S.-centric focus is the voluntary relocation of \nher husband to China. Information regarding his position, the company, and the \ncompany\u2019s owner is hazy and incomplete, his need for a foreign bank account \nunexplained, and his future plans unknown. While Applicant may be patient with her \nhusband\u2019s open-ended absence abroad, these facts are insufficient to raise \u00b6 8(b).   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. The ultimate determination of whether \nto grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated my comments under \nthe guideline at issue in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors related to the \nwhole person concept have already been discussed, but some warrant emphasis. \n \nApplicant is a mature and highly regarded medical research professional. Since \ncoming to this country, she has reinvented herself within the medical field with \ndistinction. She successfully raised a child who is now a graduate student. She enjoys \nher home, her community, and her present life. \n \nPreviously vetted to hold a public trust position, Applicant\u2019s foreign kin in China \nhave been examined previously. What again raises security concerns is Applicant\u2019s \nhusband\u2019s voluntary move to China to work for a medical research facility. Little is \nknown about this company, its management, or Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s present position \nwithin the company. His future with this entity and his continued living in China is also \nunsure. The nexus between Applicant\u2019s foreign kin in China, as well as the unknown \nvariables concerning Applicant\u2019s husband, sustain foreign influence security concerns. \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 31 years old. He has been married to his wife since 2008, and they have two minor children. He has a general education diploma. At the hearing he anticipated that he would receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in information security in September 2019. He is a remote-teleworker principal cyber-incident responder, who has been employed by a defense contractor since September 2015. He requires a security clearance for this employment. His interim secret clearance was revoked when the SOR was issued in April 2019. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 10-11, 19-21) In December 2008, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army, and a month later he started basic training. He was 20 years old. At the end of basic training, Applicant started to suffer from depression. He went to sick call to address his depression but was told that the feelings should dissipate at his next training course. Applicant had never suffered from depression prior to his service in the Army. (GE 1 at 21-22; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 11, 21, 47-48) In March 2009, Applicant graduated from basic training and transferred to another Army base for specialized training. His depression continued to affect him. In July 2009, while he was living in the barracks, Applicant attempted to cut one of his wrists with a piece of plastic or metal. The cut was superficial, but Applicant went to another soldier\u2019s room to report what he had done to himself. The soldier helped Applicant get to an Army hospital.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 1, 2016. \nOn April 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) and \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption). Applicant answered the SOR on May 3, 2019, and \nrequested a decision based upon the administrative record (Answer). On June 11 2019, \nthe Government converted the case to a hearing before an administrative judge, and \nthe case was assigned to me on June 20, 2019. On August 2, 2019, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nAugust 27, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant and I were located in \none location, and department counsel appeared via video teleconference from a second \nlocation.   \n \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted without objection, and \nApplicant testified. I received the complete transcript (Tr.) on September 4, 2019, and \nthe record closed. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. He has been married to his wife since 2008, and they \nhave two minor children. He has a general education diploma. At the hearing he \nanticipated that he would receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in information security in \nSeptember 2019. He is a remote-teleworker principal cyber-incident responder, who has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor since September 2015. He requires a security \nclearance for this employment. His interim secret clearance was revoked when the SOR \nwas issued in April 2019. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 10-11, 19-21) \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army, and a month later he \nstarted basic training. He was 20 years old. At the end of basic training, Applicant \nstarted to suffer from depression. He went to sick call to address his depression but was \ntold that the feelings should dissipate at his next training course. Applicant had never \nsuffered from depression prior to his service in the Army. (GE 1 at 21-22; GE 2 at 4; Tr. \n11, 21, 47-48) \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant graduated from basic training and transferred to \nanother Army base for specialized training. His depression continued to affect him. In \nJuly 2009, while he was living in the barracks, Applicant attempted to cut one of his \nwrists with a piece of plastic or metal. The cut was superficial, but Applicant went to \nanother soldier\u2019s room to report what he had done to himself. The soldier helped \nApplicant get to an Army hospital. Applicant was admitted to the hospital\u2019s psychiatric \ninpatient unit for three to four days as a result of his suicidal gesture or ideation. He \ndoes not recall if the hospitalization was involuntary or voluntary. (GE 1 at 21-22; GE 2 \nat 5, 9; GE 3 at 4; Tr. 21-23, 47-49) \n \nWhile he was in the hospital, Applicant went to group counseling sessions. After \nhe was discharged from the military hospital, Applicant attended weekly group \ncounseling for four to five months. He also worked with his military chain of command to \naddress his issues and attempted to remain in the Army. (Tr. 22-23, 49-54) \n \nApplicant was honorably discharged from the Army in December 2009, due his \nmental health issues, more specifically, a general inability to adapt. Following his \ndischarge from the Army, Applicant did not have any subsequent suicidal ideations; \ntherefore, he did not seek further treatment. However, he was upset that he was \ndischarged from the Army, and he continued to feel depressed. (GE 1 at 21-22; GE 2 at \n5; GE 3 at 4; Tr. 21-24, 54) \n \nApproximately one year after his military discharge, Applicant had a one-time \npreliminary therapy session with a mental health professional. At that time, he was \nsuffering from stress and needed help establishing coping mechanisms. After that \nsession, he did not obtain further treatment from this professional, nor did he seek \n\n \n3 \n \ntreatment or medical advice from another health professional. Applicant did not have a \nprimary-care physician and tried to address his stress issues by talking to his wife and a \nfriend, and by playing video games. (Tr. 23-28, 54-56) \n \nIn 2011, Applicant continued to experience stress and anxiety, and as a result, \ndid not want to go to work. He went to see his primary-care physician and was \nprescribed an unknown anti-depressant medication to address these issues. Applicant \ndid not seek further medical care. He was consuming alcohol during this period. (GE 3 \nat 4; Tr. 54-56) \n \nFrom approximately April 2014 until 2015, Applicant drank on average eight to \nten drinks a day, depending upon whether it was a work or weekend day. He drank \nmore heavily on the weekends. After his wife moved to the same town, his drinking \ndecreased to approximately five to six beers in the evening and occasionally some \nshots of whiskey. Applicant started consuming alcohol after he turned 21 in February \n2009. (Tr. 30-31, 37, 56, 68) \n \n \nIn 2015, Applicant found a therapist (Therapist A) on-line for treatment related to \nstress-based anxiety from his job at a prior employer. Applicant saw Therapist A two to \nfour times in 2015, and he discontinued treatment by mutual agreement. Applicant \ninitially saw Therapist A due to his own concerns about his level of alcohol consumption, \nand the possibility that he might have bipolar disorder. Various members of his family \nhave histories of alcohol use disorder and bipolar disorder. (GE 3 at 4-5; Tr. 28-29, 32-\n35, 57-58) \n \nTherapist A found that Applicant did not have bipolar disorder, but he suggested \nthat Applicant abstain from alcohol for a week, which he did. During this timeframe, \nApplicant\u2019s wife expressed concern regarding his drinking. After refraining from alcohol \nfor a week, Applicant continued to drink approximately five to six beers a night, but \nreduced his consumption of whiskey. Despite his concerns, Applicant continued to drink \nbecause of habit, and he enjoyed the taste of alcohol. (GE 3 at 4-5; Tr. 28-29, 32-36, \n61, 68-69) \n \n   \nApplicant went in person to see Therapist A two times in July 2018 regarding his \nuse of alcohol and his anxiety levels. Specifically, he was looking for coping \nmechanisms and medication to help decrease his consumption of alcohol and anxiety. \nAt that time, he abstained from consuming alcohol for one week to determine if he could \nstop drinking. Applicant has not sought additional therapy since July 2018, despite an \nongoing and continuing issue with anxiety. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 38-43)  \n \nIn February 2019, Applicant was required to submit to a psychological evaluation \nin conjunction with this security clearance. The evaluating psychologist (Psychologist A) \nreviewed Applicant\u2019s records, performed several tests, and interviewed Applicant prior \nto giving his opinion regarding Applicant\u2019s mental health and substance use. He \ndiagnosed Applicant with generalized anxiety disorder; alcohol use disorder, mild; and \ncompulsive personality traits. (GE 3 at 9) Additionally, Psychologist A opined that \nApplicant presents with an emotional and substance use condition that could pose a \n\n \n4 \n \nsignificant risk to his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness concerning classified \ninformation at the present time. Psychologist A stated, \u201cBased upon all information \ncurrently available to me combined with the relatively long history of his present \nconditions, [Applicant\u2019s] prognosis to overcome his anxiety and alcohol use appears \npoor.\u201d (GE 3 at 10) \n \nDuring the February 2019 interview with Psychologist A, Applicant acknowledged \nthat he drinks too much and for the past two years, he had been drinking approximately \nfive to six beers every day. Psychologist A opined that Applicant \u201creported engaging in \nhabitual and binge substance use daily. It appears highly likely that [Applicant] \nconsumes alcohol to the point of impaired cognitive ability and impaired judgment \nregularly.\u201d (GE 3 at 3-4, 9-10) \n \nApplicant told Psychologist A that he consumes alcohol to help him relax and feel \nless anxious, which is consistent with Psychologist A\u2019s opinion that, \u201cGiven that his \nreported anxiety predates his alcohol consumption, it seems likely that his current \nalcohol consumption is a form of self-medicating his anxiety, a means to calm and relax \nhimself.\u201d (GE 3 at 3-4, 9; Tr. 69-70)  \n \nApplicant denied having any suicidal thoughts since 2009; however, he told \nPsychologist A that he has a history of disturbances in mood, including anxiety and \ndepression. One of the tests administered to Applicant indicated that \u201cApplicant may \nhave been reluctant to acknowledge personal limitations and he may repress or deny \ndistress. This tendency may lead him to minimize, or perhaps be unaware of, problems \nor other areas where functioning may be less than optimal.\u201d (GE 3 at 7-8; Tr. 62) \n \nApplicant testified that he reduced his whiskey consumption after meeting with \nPsychologist A in February 2019. Psychologist A noted in his findings that the \ninformation Applicant provided to him contained a number of discrepancies between the \ninformation provided by Applicant and the documentation provided by the DOD CAF. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding his history of consumption of alcohol was \ninconsistent. (GE 3 at 8; Tr. 45, 69-70) \n \nThe night before the hearing, Applicant consumed four beers and felt the effects \nof alcohol. The last time Applicant felt \u201chung over\u201d was over the July 4th holiday. He \ndoes not remember how much alcohol he consumed, but it was more than 10 drinks. \nThis was also the last time he consumed whiskey. He does not recall the last time that \nhe went to work with a hangover. Applicant initially testified that as a teleworker, he has \nnot started work hung over; however, after being confronted, he admitted that \noccasionally he teleworks while feeling hung over. (Tr. 32, 58-59, 62-63, 70-71)  \n \nThe week before the hearing, Applicant abstained from alcohol for two days to \nhelp a friend who was attempting to abstain. The longest period Applicant has been \nable to abstain since 2014 is one week. Applicant\u2019s wife has expressed concerns \nregarding his drinking level, due to the financial costs and negative health \nconsequences. Applicant continues to keep alcohol in his home. (Tr. 59-60, 67-68) \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has never taken medication related to his consumption of alcohol. He \nhas never attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), nor has he sought additional \ncounseling related to his consumption of alcohol. Despite the 2019 diagnosis of alcohol \nuse disorder and the issuance of the SOR, Applicant continues to drink alcohol because \nhe enjoys the taste; it is a habit; and it helps him relax. He feels in a \u201cbetter mental state \nwhen [he\u2019s] in a buzz from drinking alcohol.\u201d Nor has Applicant sought any additional \ntreatment for his anxiety issues. (GE 3 at 7; Tr. 45, 62, 65, 69-70)  \n \nApplicant testified that he disagrees with Psychologist A\u2019s diagnosis and \nassessment of his drinking. Specifically, he does not believe that his use of alcohol \nnegatively affects his judgment or his ability to do his job. (Tr. 64) \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant submitted four letters of recommendation from \ncolleagues and a family member. The letters describe him as polite, honest, \nprofessional, and knowledgeable. (Answer; Tr. 72-75)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n6 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for psychological conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \nThe record evidence established the above disqualifying conditions. Appellant \nhas been diagnosed by a duly qualified mental health professional with a condition that \nimpairs his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. At the hearing, he admitted that he \nhas not received any treatment since July 2018. In 2009, Applicant was hospitalized for \nseveral days due to a suicidal gesture while he was on active duty in the Army.  \n \nAG \u00b6 29 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns in \nthis case: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \n \nApplicant has not sought treatment for his anxiety since 2018, nor has he ever \nsought consistent mental-health treatment, despite suffering from anxiety and \ndepression for approximately ten years. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nuse disorder or his anxiety are under control or in remission. Additionally, the record \ndemonstrates that Applicant\u2019s anxiety and depression have been ongoing for many \nyears and are not temporary conditions.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide evidence of consistent and ongoing treatment, and did \nnot establish that he is no longer suffering from the underlying conditions. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 29(a), 29(b), 29(c), 29(d), and 29(e) was not established. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following two \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n(b) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant has admitted to a history of abusing alcohol, and he has sought \ntreatment intermittently since approximately 2014 or 2015 related to the level of his \nalcohol consumption. In February 2019, he was diagnosed by a duly qualified \nprofessional with alcohol use disorder, mild. Despite this diagnosis, he continues to \nconsume alcohol to the point of intoxication. He has not sought treatment, attended AA, \nor significantly modified his behavior. Less than two months before the hearing, \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol and drank to the point of intoxication. He presented no \nevidence of a pattern of responsible use of alcohol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) do \nnot apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and I in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence.  \n \n \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Psychological Condition:   \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Alcohol Consumption: \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM, and identified as Items 1 \nthrough 7, is admitted without objection. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM.  The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2019. Based on my review of \nthe documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations or personal conduct concerns. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2003. He served in the U.S. Navy from August 2005 to August 2010, \nreceiving an honorable discharge. (Item 4) Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in \n2012. He is divorced and has no children. (Item 3 ) In 2016, Applicant obtained a \ncertificate in motorcycle mechanics. He has been with his current employer since \nFebruary 2017. Applicant has held a security clearance since 2009. (GE 4) \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k delinquent debts and judgmernts totaling \napproximately $26,841. (Items  2, 6, and 7) Applicant admitted the financial allegations \nlisted in the SOR. (Item 1, 2) Under personal conduct (SOR 2.a and 2.b), he denied the \nSOR allegations. \n \n \nApplicant provided no explanation for any of the delinquent debts that were \ncharged-off or in collection. He  also incurred two judgments from a hospital for medical \nbills.  He reported unemployment from March 2015 to August 2016. (Item 3, 4) He has \nworked steadily since that time. He noted that his current salary is $75,000 a year. (Item \n2) \n \n \nApplicant replied in his answer that he has made payment arrangements with the \ncreditors, but he did not provide any documentation. However, his 2019 credit bureau \nreport shows that Applicant has made some payments toward his delinquent accounts, \nbut three accounts remain in collection, and the majority of the delinquencies are still \nunresolved. (Item 5) SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.k are related to medical collection \naccounts or judgments. He stated in his answer that he is working with the regional \nmedical center to resolve the delinquent medical debts. He was involved in an accident \nand did not have health insurance. He provided no other details. \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose on his  March 2017 SCA that he had any delinquent \ndebts. (Item 2) He responded \u201cNo\u201d to each question in Section 26 concerning  \ndelinquencies. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he was unaware of his financial \ndelinquencies and did not list anything.  During his 2018 investigative interview, Applicant \ndenied having any judgments (1.h and 1.l) in the last seven years. After the investigator \nconfronted Applicant, he responded that he did not disclose them on the SCA because \nhe did not believe they would appear on his credit report.  He knew they existed because \nhis mother told him in 2016. He admits they are not paid. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d as to \n\n3 \n \nany other delinquent bills. Applicant denied the falsification allegations under SOR 2.a \nand 2.b. He was confronted with the charged-off account alleged in \u00b6 1.a for $16,151. \nDuring his interview, he stated that he was aware of the account, but it was not paid \nbecause he was unemployed. Applicant knew it was for the purchase of a motorcycle. \n \n \nApplicant intends to pay his delinquent debts. He stated that he now has the means \nto pay the delinquent bills. To his credit, his 2019 credit report shows that he has recently \nmade some attempts to pay under a partial payment agreement. (Item 5, 6)  He made a \n$52 payment for SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b and 1.c. There is no information in the record concerning \nfinancial counseling or use of a budget. \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under the Personal Conduct Guideline at \u00b6 2.a, that he falsified \nmaterial facts on his 2017 SCA when answering Section 26 in totality, Applicant did not \nlist any delinquent debts, defaults, charged-off accounts, or collection accounts. He \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to each subsection in Section 26:Financial Record. Applicant denied this \nallegation of falsification in his SOR response. \n \n \nIn his 2018 investigative interview with an invetigator, Applicant acknowledged the \ndebts and judgments, after being confronted. He thought they were not on his credit report \nand that he had moved many times since his discharge from the Navy. This was the \nreason for the bills not being addressed. He gave no valid reason for not listing the other \ndebts that were on his credit reports. Applicant\u2019s three credit reports, including the 2019 \nreport reflect the delinquent accounts. (Items 5-7) \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n4 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n5 \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, and failure to provide \nany documentation, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant provided no evidence of payment arrangements or receipts for any of \nthe debts. He did not present any evidence to show that he has made a good-faith effort \nto start paying his delinquent bills, despite unemployment in March 2015 to August 2016. \nSince then, he has been gainfully employed. He promised to pay and set up payment \nplans in the future. However, he provided no documentation to confirm his assertions. \nApplicant stated that he earns $75,000 a year and now has the ability to pay his delinquent \ndebts. There is no information in the record concerning financial counseling or use of a \n\n6 \n \nbudget. Applicant has furnished insufficient information to meet his burden.  None of the \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied SOR allegation \u00b6 2.a and\u00b6 2.b that he deliberately falsified \nhis security clearance application by not disclosing any delinquent debts or \ncolletion accounts in response to Section 26. He did note during his 2018 \ninvestigative interview that he knew since 2016 about the medical \njudgments. He believed that they would not be listed on his credit report. \nHowever, when confronted with the others he had no valid reason as to why \nhe did not list the other accounts. He knew about these accounts becaue \nhe then provided explanations about each of them and why they were not \npaid.  He deliberately did not report them. Therefore, AG\u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \n17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n7 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \nHere, Applicant intentionally failed to report material information about his debts \non his 2017 security clearance application in Section 26 of  that SCA. Applicant\u2019s actions \nreveal untrustworthy or unreliable behavior and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. He has not met his burden to mitigate the personal conduct concern. None \nof the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nApplicant has  held a security clearance. He has worked for a number of years as \na contractor. He did not respond to the FORM, thus there is no other information about \nhis background.   \n \n \nThe record does not provide sufficient information as to why Applicant accrued his \ndelinquent debts. He was unemployed for a  time in 2015 and 2016. He wants to pay his \ndebts and promises to set up plans. He has made several small payments, but the \nmajority of his debts are not resolved. He has not received financial counseling. There is \nno evidence of payments or payment plans.  \n \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his security clearance application in section 26. He \nhas not has mitigated the financial or personal conduct security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 61 years old. He is not currently working for a defense contractor, but he has the opportunity to gain a position should he receive a security clearance. He currently works temporary jobs. He was unemployed from: October 2008-July 2009; November 2010-December 2010; November 2011-April 2014; and January 2015- August 2016.

DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective within the DOD on June \n8, 2017 (AG). \nIn an undated response, Applicant answered (Answer) the SOR. The case was \nassigned to me on August 26, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 11, 2019, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on September 23, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) \n1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Department \n\n \n2 \n \nCounsel\u2019s exhibit list and discovery letter were marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I-II. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-E, which I admitted without objection. The \nrecord was held open until October 11, 2019. Applicant\u2019s timely post-hearing \nsubmissions were marked as AE F-S and admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 2, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in his Answer. His admissions are \nincorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. He is not currently working for a defense contractor, but \nhe has the opportunity to gain a position should he receive a security clearance. He \ncurrently works temporary jobs. He was unemployed from: October 2008-July 2009; \nNovember 2010-December 2010; November 2011-April 2014; and January 2015-\nAugust 2016. He served in the military for over 20 years, was honorably discharged, \nand is receiving a monthly pension in the amount of approximately $655. He is a high \nschool graduate. He is single, has never married, and has no children. (Tr. 6, 21, 23; \nGE 1; AE A) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns \nfor the following years: 2008-2010, 2012-2014 and 2017. It also alleged that he owed \nfederal taxes in the amount of approximately $21,000. He admitted in his response to \ninterrogatories, his Answer, and his hearing testimony not timely filing his federal tax \nreturns for those years and owing federal taxes. (Tr. 24-27, 30-31; GE 2-3; Answer)  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his tax problems to two factors. First, he claims he was \nhomeless for a number of years and that during that time he only was able to secure \n\u201codd jobs.\u201d Second, he acknowledged that he was \u201ca little bit irresponsible\u201d in dealing \nwith his tax issues. He documented that for tax years 2008-2010, he filed his tax returns \nin March 2012. He did not owe federal taxes for those years. For tax years 2012-2014, \nhe filed his tax returns in May 2016. He owed approximately $350 in federal taxes for \n2012. For tax year 2017, he filed his tax return in March 2019. He did not owe federal \ntaxes for that year. Applicant\u2019s large tax debt is attributable to tax year 2006, in which he \nowed approximately $15,000 in taxes that he has been unable to pay. Over time, \nincluding interest and penalties, that amount has grown larger. (Tr. 30-31; GE 2-3; AE \nB-C, H-S) \n \n \nOver the past two years, Applicant claims that he paid his tax debt in cash \ndirectly to the local IRS office. He did not provide receipts of those payments. The \nrecord remained open until October 11, 2019 to allow Applicant to produce additional \nevidence of any cash payments, but he failed to do so. His documentation with the IRS \nshows that in March 2016, the IRS agreed to accept $162 monthly payments from \nApplicant. He did not provide documentation of making any of those payments. In \nMarch 2019, the IRS agreed to another installment plan with him requiring monthly \npayments of $624 beginning March 25, 2019. Applicant documented that he set up an \n\n \n3 \n \nundated automatic payment from his bank, but he only showed making two payments, \nin August and September 2019 of $250 each time, which is less than the installment \nagreement called for him to make. He did not provide any other proof of tax payments. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. His August 2019 credit report shows no \nother delinquent debts. He asserted that if he received his clearance, his expected job \nwould allow him to pay his tax debt within six months. (Tr. 25-27, 36; GE 3, 5; AE E, G)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant had unfiled federal tax returns from 2008-2010, 2012-2014, and 2017. \nHe also owes in excess of $15,000 for unpaid federal taxes. I find both the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant failed to make a good-faith effort to resolve his federal tax issues for \nnumerous tax years. Although he eventually filed all his tax returns, which would \nindicate responsible action by him, he failed to do so in a timely manner. He also is \ndelinquent in paying tax debt that arose in 2006. Meeting his legal tax obligations was \nnot a priority to Applicant. This pattern shows a lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s intermittent work and homelessness may be conditions beyond his \ncontrol, but his admitted irresponsibility was not beyond his control. He eventually filed \nall his tax returns, but has not paid his delinquent tax debt. He has not acted \nresponsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant provided some evidence that his tax filing problems are under control. \nHe receives some credit for eventually filing all his delinquent federal tax returns. \nHowever, he has failed to pay his delinquent tax debt arising from 2006, despite the \nIRS\u2019s willingness to agree to two different installment payment plans. Applicant \ndocumented only two recent payments, apparently under the plan, but which were less \nthan the agreed upon amount. Overall, good-faith efforts to pay or resolve his tax issues \nare lacking. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and AG \u00b6 20(g) only partially apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n6 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, his unemployment, underemployment, \nand his homelessness. However, I also considered that his federal returns went unfiled \nfor a lengthy time and he still owes over $15,000 in unpaid tax debt from 2006. He has \nnot shown responsibility in exercising his lawful duty to file his federal tax returns in a \ntimely manner, or pay his taxes.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with very brief comments, nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.k., and 1.m. through 1.bb.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a registered nurse with her current employer since February 2018. She previously served as a director of clinic operations for another employer from November 2016 until December 2017, when her position was eliminated due to budget cuts; and before that, as an independent nurse contractor from August 2005 until December 2017. A 1987 high school graduate, Applicant received a diploma in nursing in 1996; an associate\u2019s degree in nursing in 1999, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing in 2002. She has never served with the U.S. military. She was married in 1991, and divorced in 2010. She remarried in 2011. She has two children, born in 1990 and 1992.

    "full_text": "1 \n   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n--- \n) \nADP Case No. 19-00876 \n) \nApplicant for Public Trust Position \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Gatha Manns, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/22/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 10, 2018, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On March 29, 2019, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals \nwho require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility \nto hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \noccupying a public trust position to support a contract with the DOD. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such eligibility \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement dated June 5, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nshe elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 5, 2019, and she was afforded \nan opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. \nApplicant received the FORM on July 18, 2019. Her response was due on August 17, \n2019. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of October 16, 2019, no \nresponse had been received. The case was assigned to me on October 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with very brief comments, nearly all \nof the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.k., and 1.m. through 1.bb.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a registered nurse with her current employer since February 2018. She previously \nserved as a director of clinic operations for another employer from November 2016 until \nDecember 2017, when her position was eliminated due to budget cuts; and before that, \nas an independent nurse contractor from August 2005 until December 2017. A 1987 high \nschool graduate, Applicant received a diploma in nursing in 1996; an associate\u2019s degree \nin nursing in 1999, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing in 2002. She has never served with \nthe U.S. military. She was married in 1991, and divorced in 2010. She remarried in 2011.  \nShe has two children, born in 1990 and 1992. (Item 3) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated January 30, 2018); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nFebruary 22, 2019); Item 7 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated September 28, 2018); \nItem 5 (Applicant\u2019s Response to the Interrogatories, dated February 22, 2019; Item 2 \n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated June 5, 2019); and Item 3 (e-QIP, dated January 10, \n2018).  \nWhen Applicant completed her January 2018 e-QIP, she acknowledged that she \nhad filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and 2012; that she had one delinquent automobile loan; \nhad a lien; and that she had failed to file her federal income tax returns for several tax \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nyears. (Item 3, at 38-47) She was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) in September 2018. During that interview, she discussed \nthe above financial issues, but it was only after she was confronted with additional \ndelinquent accounts that she shared the facts associated with those accounts as well. \n(Item 7)  \nDuring the trustworthiness eligibility review process, Applicant attributed her failure \nto maintain her financial accounts in a current status, as well as her failure to file her \nincome tax returns, to a variety of issues: her 2010 divorce, unspecified medical \nemergencies, and her period of unemployment, all leading to insufficient funds. Her failure \nto file her multi-year federal income tax returns was attributed to trying to do so without \nprofessional assistance, and subsequent fear of filing because of her failure to file for the \nprevious year(s). (Item 7; Item 2) Some of the delinquent accounts were charged off, \nsome were sold or transferred to debt purchasers, and one lien was filed. She attributed \nher multiple bankruptcy filings to legal advice that she reportedly received from her \nattorney. (Item 5)  \nThe SOR alleged the filing of four voluntary petitions for bankruptcy under Chapter \n13; unfiled federal income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, \n2015, and 2016; a federal tax lien; as well as 21 delinquent accounts, including unpaid \nfederal and state income taxes, totaling approximately $137,935. With respect to the \ndelinquent accounts, Applicant contended that some of the accounts listed in the SOR \nmay have already been resolved, and that she had been making monthly payments on \nother accounts, but she failed to submit any documents, such as a statement from the \ncreditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank \nregister, or receipts, to support her contentions.  As to the federal income tax returns, \nApplicant contended that she had already filed those returns, but once again, she failed \nto submit any documentation to support her contention. The SOR allegations are set forth \nbelow: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.: These refer to Applicant\u2019s repeated filings of voluntary \npetitions for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in September 2012 (dismissed in November \n2012); in October 2011 (dismissed in June 2012); in January 2010 (dismissed in February \n2012); and August 2009 (dismissed in March 2010). The most recent petition reflected \nliabilities of approximately $146,957. In each instance, the dismissals were ordered \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to make plan payments to the trustee. (Item 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.bb., and 1.cc.: These refer to Applicant\u2019s failure to file her federal \nand state income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and \n2016, as well as her failure to pay the respective federal and state income taxes for those \nyears. In her January 2018 e-QIP, she acknowledged her failure to file those federal \nincome tax returns. (Item 3, at 40-42) However, in her Answer to the SOR, she contended \nthat she had done so. (Item 2) She failed to submit any documents, such as account \ntranscripts, copies of the reportedly filed federal income tax returns, or any \ncorrespondence from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to confirm her contentions. In \naddition, in her most recent Chapter 13 voluntary petition, she reported $20,000 in \ndelinquent federal income taxes and $17,000 in delinquent state income taxes.  (Item 6) \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nIn the absence of the appropriate documentation, the issues regarding the federal and \nstate income tax returns, including the nonpayment of taxes, have not been resolved. \nThere is a legal requirement to file a federal income tax return, and it is based upon \nan individual\u2019s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined, \nunder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, that there is an \nobligation to so file, the following applies: \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or \nrequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make \na return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to \npay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or \nsupply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, \nshall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than \n$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more \nthan 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of \nany person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, \nthis section shall not apply to such person with respect to such failure if \nthere is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such \nfailure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the \nfirst sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \n\"misdemeanor\" and \"5 years\" for \"1 year.\" \nSOR \u00b6 1.f.: This refers to a student loan with a total balance of $60,515, of which \n$4,361 is past due. Applicant claimed that she had an agreed repayment plan, and that \nshe was making monthly payments of $447. (Item 7, at 9) However, she failed to submit \nany documents, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, \ncancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support her \ncontentions. In the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account is \nnot yet in the process of being resolved. \n SOR \u00b6 1.g.: This refers to an automobile loan with a past-due and unpaid balance \nof $20,066 that was charged off. Her monthly payments were $642. Applicant claimed \nthat the loan became delinquent in 2016. (Item 5, at 9; Item 4, at 2; Item 7, at 6) She \nindicated that because the loan has a very high interest, she intended to pay it off first. \n(Item 7, at 6) She failed to submit any documents, such as a statement from the creditor \nagreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, \nor receipts, to support her contentions. In the absence of such documentation, I must \nconclude that the account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \n SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h., 1.o., 1.p., 1.r., 1.t., 1.u., 1.w., and 1.y. through 1.aa.: These refer to \nvarious medical accounts with unpaid balances of $2,202, $509, $485, $247, $242, $205, \n$174, $169, $169, and $121 for which Applicant has not made any resolution efforts. \n(Item 4, at 2; Item 5, at 11-14; Item 7, at 6-9) These accounts are not yet in the process \nof being resolved. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. and 1.k.: These refer to two bank-issued credit-card accounts with \nunpaid balances of $845 on one account that was sold to a debt purchaser; and $366 on \nthe other account for which $543 was charged off in March 2016. (Item 5, at 8; Item 4, at \n2) Applicant admitted that she was indebted to the creditors, but contended that she had \nbeen making agreed-upon $75 monthly payments to the first creditor, and had paid off \nboth accounts on March 1, 2016.  (Item 7, at 10) She failed to submit any documentation, \nsuch as statements from the creditors agreeing to repayment plans, cancelled checks, \ncopies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support her contention that she \nhad an agreement with one creditor; that she was making any payments to that creditor; \nor that either account had been paid off as she had contended. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, I conclude that the accounts have not been resolved, and are not yet in \nthe process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j.: This refers to a bank-issued credit-card of account with an unpaid \nbalance of $512 that was sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 9; Item 4, at 2) Applicant \nadmitted that she is indebted to the creditor, but failed to explain if she had made any \nefforts to resolve the account. This account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l.: This refers to a federal tax lien in the amount of $9,649 that was filed \nagainst Applicant in 2010. (Item 5, at 6) Applicant contended that the lien should have \nbeen resolved before she was interviewed by the OPM investigator in September 2018, \nbut acknowledged that if it had not already been resolved, she intended to pay it off by \nFebruary 2019. (Item 7, at 4) Applicant failed to submit any documentation, such as a \nsigned release of lien, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or \nreceipts, to support her contention that she paid off the lien amount and that it had been \nreleased. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the federal tax lien has \nnot been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m.: This refers to a line-of-credit account with an unpaid balance of $2,754 \nthat was charged off. (Item 5, at 8) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no \nknowledge of the account, she subsequently admitted that she is indebted to the creditor. \n(Item 7, at 8; Item 2) She failed to explain if she had made any efforts to resolve the \naccount. The account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n.: This refers to a cellular-telephone account with an unpaid balance of \n$768. (Item 5, at 8) Applicant admitted that she is indebted to the creditor. (Item 7, at 4; \nItem 2) She failed to explain if she had made any efforts to resolve the account. The \naccount is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.q.: This refers to an Internet account with an unpaid balance of $350. \n(Item 5, at 11) Applicant admitted that she is indebted to the creditor, but contended that \nshe had \u201cbeen making monthly payment arrangements.\u201d (Item 7, at 8; Item 2) She failed \nto submit any documentation, such as statements from the creditor agreeing to a \nrepayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, \nto support her contention that she either had an agreement or that she was working on \nsuch an agreement; or that she was making any payments to the creditor. In the absence \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nof such documentation, I conclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet \nin the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.s.: This refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance \nof $243. (Item 5, at 12) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no knowledge \nof the account, she subsequently admitted that she was indebted to the creditor. She also \nstated that she believed the debt had been settled. (Item 7, at 8; Item 2) She failed to \nsubmit any documentation, such as statements from the creditor agreeing to a repayment \nplan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support \nher \u201cbelief\u201d that she had settled the account. In the absence of such documentation, I \nconclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.v.: This refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance \nof $175. (Item 5, at 13) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no knowledge \nof the account, she subsequently admitted that she was indebted to the creditor. She also \nstated that she believed the debt had been settled. (Item 7, at 7; Item 2) She failed to \nsubmit any documentation, such as statements from the creditor agreeing to a repayment \nplan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support \nher \u201cbelief\u201d that she had settled the account. In the absence of such documentation, I \nconclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.x.: This refers to an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance \nof $169. (Item 5, at 13) Although Applicant initially indicated that she had no knowledge \nof the account, she subsequently admitted that she was indebted to the creditor. She also \nstated that she believed the debt had been settled. (Item 7, at 7; Item 2) She failed to \nsubmit any documentation, such as statements from the creditor agreeing to a repayment \nplan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support \nher \u201cbelief\u201d that she had settled the account. In the absence of such documentation, I \nconclude that the account has not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being \nresolved. \nThe most recent report of Applicant\u2019s net monthly income appears in her Voluntary \nPetition for Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 filed in September 2012. It was $3,000. She \nalso reported $1,325 in monthly expenses. (Item 6) It is not known what Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial resources may be because she did not report her current net monthly \nincome; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available for \ndiscretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. The only evidence \nof financial counseling was the on-line counseling she received in connection with her \nbankruptcy filings. In the absence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to \ndetermine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to such information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d  \n \nDOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the \nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  In this regard, \nit should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated \nNovember 19, 2004, covers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. \nThe memorandum directed DOHA to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor \ncases for trustworthiness determinations.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in \nthe record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nApplicant filed four voluntary petitions for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 that were \ndismissed because of her failure to make plan payments to the trustee. In addition, she \nhad unfiled federal income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, \n2015, and 2016; a federal tax lien; as well as a substantial number of delinquent accounts, \nincluding unpaid federal and state income taxes. With respect to Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nher federal income tax returns for the identified tax years, AG \u00b6 19(f) has been \nestablished. With respect to her failure to satisfy her various delinquent debts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) have been established. There is no evidence that Applicant has been \nunwilling to satisfy her debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not \nbeen established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(g) minimally apply, but none of the other conditions \napply. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing financial difficulties, and her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve her \ndelinquent accounts for several years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not \ninfrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. \nApplicant attributed her failure to maintain her financial accounts in a current status, as \nwell as her failure to file her income tax returns, to a variety of issues: her 2010 divorce, \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nunspecified medical emergencies, and her period of unemployment, all leading to \ninsufficient funds. Her failure to file her multi-year federal income tax returns was \nattributed to trying to do so without professional assistance, and subsequent fear of filing \nbecause of her failure to file for the previous year(s). She attributed her multiple \nbankruptcy filings to legal advice that she reportedly received from her attorney.   \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance, and by inference, his or her public \ntrust position, is in jeopardy, may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow \nrules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own \ninterests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case \nNo. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant completed her e-QIP in January \n2018; underwent her OPM interview in September 2018; the SOR was issued in March \n2019; and the FORM was sent to her in July 2019. Each step of the trustworthiness review \nprocess placed her on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting her. \nWith respect to her delinquent debts, according to Applicant, she addressed several of \nthose debts, but took no actions regarding the remaining debts. However, as stated \nabove, she failed to submit any documents to support any of her purported resolution \nactions. With respect to her unfiled federal income tax returns, according to Applicant\u2019s \nacknowledgement in September 2018, she had not yet taken any corrective actions to file \nthe delinquent income tax returns. It was not until the SOR was issued that she claimed \nto have filed those income tax returns, but once again, she failed to submit any documents \nto support her purported resolution actions.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting \n[sensitive] information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002). As we have noted in the past, a [trustworthiness] adjudication is not \ndirected at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing \nan applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to \nfulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to [sensitive] \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, \n284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s public-trust worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to [sensitive] \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \n \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is no evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took any good-faith corrective actions with respect to her delinquent debts \nbefore she received the SOR. There are also substantial unverified comments by \nApplicant that she resolved or started to resolve some delinquent accounts, but she \noffered no documentation to support her contentions. Her contentions regarding the \nstatus of some accounts, and her unverified comments claiming that she had taken \ncertain actions, without documents to support her claims, are insufficient to reflect good-\nfaith actions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, other than the on-line counseling \nassociated with Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filings, or a budget. In the absence of additional \nfinancial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially than she had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 \nF.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \nregistered nurse with her current employer since February 2018. She previously served \nas a director of clinic operations for another employer from November 2016 until \nDecember 2017, when her position was eliminated due to budget cuts; and before that, \nas an independent nurse contractor from August 2005 until December 2017. A 1987 high \nschool graduate, Applicant received a diploma in nursing in 1996; an associate\u2019s degree \nin nursing in 1999, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing in 2002.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for the \ntax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Although she now claims that \nshe has finally filed those returns, she submitted no documentation to support her claims.  \nShe also had a number of delinquent accounts, including a federal tax lien and unpaid \nfederal and state income taxes that were ignored by her for lengthy periods of time. \nApplicant contended that she had paid off some of the creditors, or entered into \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nrepayment agreements with other creditors. However, because of her failure to submit \ndocumentation associated with her delinquent accounts, such as receipts, cancelled \nchecks, or bank account transactions, to support her contentions that some accounts \nhave been settled, paid off, or otherwise resolved; or that agreed settlements have \nactually proceeded to resolution; or that payments have actually been made to her \ncreditors, it is difficult to assess the true situation, for we have mostly Applicant\u2019s \nunverified comments claiming that she had taken certain actions.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that she took certain actions with respect to her \ndelinquent debts and unfiled federal income tax returns, there is no documentary \nevidence to support a conclusion that any of Applicant\u2019s claimed actions took place. \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is extremely poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves \nme with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nposition of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. \nA, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k., \n \n1.m. through 1.cc.:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust to support a contract with the DOD.

Administrative Judge \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated foreign influence concerns relating to her connections to Jordan, \nIraq, and Israel. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive \nposition is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 26, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the foreign influence guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 4, 2019, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 16, 2019. A hearing was scheduled for August 26, \n2019, and heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of two exhibits. (GEs)  Applicant relied on eight exhibits and four witnesses \n(including herself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 4, 2019.  \n \nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of facts \ncontained in three attachments related to the country of Jordan; seven documents \nrelated to the country of Israel; and six attachments related to the country of Iraq. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004).  \n \nAdministrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that \nare well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For \ngood cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named \nbackground reports addressing the geopolitical situations in Jordan, Iraq, and Israel. \n \nAdministrative notice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent \nwith the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This notice did not foreclose Applicant \nfrom challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports \naddressing the current status of Iraq, Jordan, and Israel. \n \nProcedural Issues  \n \nBefore the close of the proceedings, Applicant moved to amend the SOR to \nsubstitute the alleged location of property referenced in SOR \u00b6 1.c from Jordan to Iraq. \nFor good cause shown, Applicant\u2019s substitution request was granted. With the \nsubstitution, Applicant changed her denial of the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1.c to \nan admit.  \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly (a) has a half-brother who is a dual citizen \nof Israel and Jordan and is a resident of Israel; (b) has a half-sister who is a citizen and \nresident of Israel; (c) owns property in Jordan with an approximate value of $500,000 \nUSD (amended to place the property in Iraq); (d) owns property in Jordan with an \napproximate value of $24,011 USD; and (e) has a spouse who will receive retirement \nbenefits from an employee\u2019s union in Jordan valued at $340 monthly, in approximately \n2020. \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations (inclusive of \nthe allegations contained in SOR \u00b61.c as amended). She added no claims or \nexplanations.   \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old financial analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nBackground \n \n \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth and a naturalized dual citizen from Jordan. \nShe became a naturalized Jordanian citizen in January 2006 through her husband\u2019s \nJordanian citizenship and remains a dual citizen with Jordan. (GE 1; Tr. 163-165) She \nreceived a Jordanian passport in 2006 and used it on six occasions to visit her husband \nand relatives in Jordan between May 2006 and January 2010. (GE 1) Her Jordanian \npassport expired in 2011, and she has never renewed it. (Tr. 163) Should her retained \nJordanian citizenship pose problems with her security clearance eligibility, she is willing \nto renounce it. (Tr. 165)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are naturalized U.S. citizens who held dual citizenship with \nJordan. (GE 1) Her mother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1972 and currently \nresides with Applicant and her husband. (GE 1; Tr. 68-69) Her mother\u2019s U.S. passport \nexpired in 1985 and has not been renewed. (GE 1 and AE A; Tr. 68-69) Applicant\u2019s \nfather passed away in December 2014. (GE 1 and AE A; Tr. 67)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a Jordanian citizen by birth who immigrated to the United \nStates from Jordan in 1985, applied for U.S. citizenship the same year, and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 1991. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 67) His parents became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens in the early 1990s, hold dual citizenship with Jordan, and have resided in the \nUnited States. (GE 1 and AE A) His father passed away in December 1993. (GE 1 and \nAE A; Tr. 77, 158) His mother recently renewed her U.S. passport and resides with \nApplicant and himself. (GE 2 and AE A; Tr. 68, 77) \n \n \nApplicant married in August 1987 and has three children (ages 30, 29, and 15), \nwho are U.S. residents and citizens by birth. (GE 1; Tr. 64. 150-152, 160-162) She \nearned bachelor\u2019s and  master\u2019s degrees with honors from a respected university in her \nstate of residence in December 1995 and December 2012, respectively, with excellent \nsoftware skills. (GE 1) and AE C. She reported no prior military service. \n \n \nSince March 2019, Applicant has been employed by her current defense \ncontractor. (GE 1; Tr. 140) She has been employed contemporaneously as a part-time \nadjunct lecturer at a local university (her alma mater) since January 2016. (GE 1 and AE \nA) Between August 2018 and March 2019, she was employed as a litigation financial \nanalyst for a federal agency. (GE 1; Tr. 140-141) And, between May December 2012 \nand August 2018, she worked for a local municipal government agency as an \naccounting and financial division chief. (GE 1 and AE A)  \n \nWhile in college completing her master\u2019s degree (2010-2012), Applicant held a \ntemporary position for part of her academic tenure. (GE 1 and AE A) Applicant has not \npreviously held a security clearance. (Tr. 143-145)  \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \nBetween March 1991 and August 2005, Applicant\u2019s husband worked as a senior \ntransportation civil engineer (design manager) for a transportation agency in Applicant\u2019s  \nstate of residence. (AE E; Tr. 73-74) He took a leave of absence from his state agency \nposition from August 2005 to December 2007 to serve as a transportation engineer for \nIraq\u2019s reconstruction ministry and transportation attach\u00e9 to the U.S. Department of \nState. (AE E; Tr. 72-74) While serving in Iraq, he possessed a security clearance and \ndiplomatic passport. (Tr. 72) Returning to the United States, he has worked for the \nsame state transportation agency from January 2008 to the present. (AE E) \n \nFamily connections with Jordan, Israel, and Iraq \n \n \nApplicant has two sisters. One is a U.S. citizen who has resided with her \nhusband  and four children in Jordan since returning to the country in 2007. (GEs 1-2; \nTr. 50-51, 128-129) The other sister is a Jordanian citizen who resides in the United \nStates. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 50-51, 128)  \n \n \nApplicant has a half-brother who is a dual citizen of Israel and Jordan, and a \nresident of Israel. (GEs 1-2 and AE A; Tr. 86-87, 146-147) Applicant last saw her half-\nbrother in 2011 at a wedding of one of her nieces in Israel. (GE 1; Tr. 146-147) More \nrecently, she saw her half-brother in 2017, while traveling to Jordan for another niece\u2019s \nwedding. (Tr.148) Applicant has maintained infrequent contact with him since her return \nto the United States from Jordan in 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 146-148)  \n \nBesides her half-brother, Applicant has a half-sister, who is also a citizen and \nresident of Israel. (GE 1; Tr. 146-148) She saw her half-sister in 2010 while attending \nher niece\u2019s wedding in Israel and saw her half-sister more recently in Jordan (in 2017) \nat the wedding of another niece. (GE 1; Tr. 146-148)  \n \nExcept for her two visits to Jordan in 2010 and 2017, she has had no personal \ncontact with either her half-brother or half-sister and maintains infrequent contact with \nboth of them  since returning to the United States in 2010. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 148) Applicant \nhas no close bonds, ties, or connections with either of her half siblings.(Tr. 45, 146-148)  \n \nAltogether, Applicant has 38 family members, 35 of which are U.S. citizens. (GEs \n1-2; Tr. 128) Her three family members who are not U.S. citizens are her stepmother \nand two of her stepmother\u2019s three children. (Tr. 130-131)  \n \nFinancial condition \n \n \nApplicant and her husband own real estate in Iraq, which they estimated to \napproximate $500,000 USD in value. (GE 2 and AEs A-B; Tr. 74-78) The Iraq property \nconsists of a large tract (hundreds of acres) of undivided land originally owned by his \ngrandfather. (Tr. 75) This property was later deeded to Applicant\u2019s father and five other \nsiblings in six undivided interests years ago. (Tr.  75-76) After his father passed away in \n1993, Applicant\u2019s husband and his siblings inherited his father\u2019s undivided interest in the \ntract of land. (Tr. 75-76) Neither Applicant\u2019s husband nor his five siblings have any \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \ncontrol over sale decisions, and in 2019, Applicant\u2019s husband received $150,000 as his \nshare of the proceeds of a small section of the Iraqi tract of land. (AE B; Tr. 75-76, 81-\n84) He has no say in future dispositions of all or part of the Iraqi property and, for this \nreason, he cannot make any safe predictions of if or when he and the other 40 \nmembers of his extended family holding interests in the tract might elect to sell off some \nor all of the remaining sections of the tract that the latter deeded to his father and five \nsiblings. (Tr.  81, 119, 137)  With his cashing out of his share of the sale proceeds, he \nestimates to have approximately $350,000 USD worth of ownership remaining in the \nproperty. (Tr. 119)  \n \n \nThe only other real estate owned by Applicant and her husband is a small tract of \nproperty in Jordan they purchased in 2007 for investment purposes that is worth \napproximately $24,011 USD. (GE 2 and AE B; Tr. 119, 153-156) Most of Applicant\u2019s \npersonal and real estate assets are situated in the United States. (AE C; Tr. 133-138) \nShe reports ownership in her U.S. residence, which is worth $855,481 according to a \nreliable real estate source, and carries a mortgage in the amount of $409,725. (AE C) \nShe reported personal assets as follows: U.S. bank deposits of $150,000 for herself and \n$377,418 for her husband, an estimated monthly state retirement balance for her \nhusband in the amount of $8,847, projected monthly social security benefits of over \n$2,900 for her husband (based on an assumed retirement age of 67), and invested \nfunds exceeding $167,000. (AE C; Tr. 157) Applicant reported annual income for herself \nof $122,468 and $162,439 for her husband. (AE C)  \n \nApplicant has excellent credit and estimates her U.S.-based net worth to be \napproximately $1,313,000. (AEs C and H; Tr. 133, 136) She neither provides nor \nreceives any financial support from her half siblings residing in Israel and does not \n\u201chave any real dealings with them.\u201d  (Tr. 131-132, 144-45)  \n \nCountry status of Jordan \n \nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by \nKing Abdullah II bin Hussein. See Request for Administrative Notice, Hashemite \nKingdom of Jordan; Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018: Jordan, U.S. \nDepartment of State (2019).  \n \nEver since it established diplomatic relations with Jordan in 1949, the United \nStates and Jordan have enjoyed a long history of cooperation and friendship. See U.S. \nRelations with Jordan: Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, (January 2020) The United States \nand Jordan share the mutual goals of comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the \nMiddle East and an end to violent extremism that threatens the security of Jordan, the \nregion, and the entire globe. (id.)  \n \nFrom 1949 to 1967, Jordan administered the West Bank. Since the 1967 war \nbetween Israel and several Arab states, Israel has maintained control of this territory. \nThe United States continues to believe that the final status of the West Bank can be \ndetermined only through negotiations among the concerned parties based on UN \nSecurity Council Resolutions 242 and 338. See id.  \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nIn 2017, the United States provided Jordan $1.7 billion in bilateral foreign \nassistance and over $200 million in DoD support. In addition to bilateral assistance, the \nUnited States has provided nearly $1.1 billion in humanitarian assistance to support \nSyrian refugees in Jordan. (id.)  In 2018, the United States and Jordan signed a non-\nbinding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to provide $6.375 billion in bilateral \nforeign assistance to Jordan over a five-year period, pending the availability of funds. \nThe MOU serves to reinforce the U.S. commitment to broaden cooperation and \ndialogue between the two countries in various areas. Examples include improving \nhealth indicators, road and water networks, building of schools, educating Jordanians, \nproviding improved access to water, resource management and conservation, providing \nenergy loan guarantees, and allowing Jordan access to affordable financing from \ninternational capital markets. See id.    \n \nThe U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the United State\u2019s first FTA with an \nArab country, has expanded the trade relationship by reducing barriers for services, \nproviding cutting-edge protection for intellectual property, ensuring regulatory \ntransparency, and requiring effective labor and environmental enforcement. See U.S. \nRelations with Jordan: Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, supra. The United States and \nJordan have an \u201copen skies\u201d civil aviation agreement; a bilateral investment treaty; a \nscience and technology cooperation agreement; and a memorandum of understanding \non nuclear energy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help diversify \nJordan\u2019s economy and promote growth. Jordan and the United States belong to a \nnumber of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, \nInternational Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is \na Partner for Cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \n \n  \nThe U.S. Department of State assesses the threat of terrorism in Jordan as high; \nwith the capital of Amman currently assessed as a high-threat location for terrorist \nactivity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. See Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, supra; Jordan 2018 Crime and \nSafety Report, U.S. Department of State (April 2019).  \n \nTransnational and indigenous terrorist groups in Jordan have demonstrated the \ncapability to plan and implement attacks. Violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, \nincluding the Islamic State of lraq and the Levant (ISIL) (also known as the Islamic State \nof Iraq and Syria, or ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra, have conducted attacks in Jordan and \ncontinue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and Western interests, and soft \ntargets such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, \nschools, and malls. Jordan\u2019s prominent role in the effort to defeat ISIS, and its shared \nborders with Iraq and Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. See id.  \n \nAlthough Jordan has remained a committed partner on counterterrorism and \ncountering violent extremism, numerous terrorist incidents reflect the current security \nsituation in Jordan: throughout 2017-2019, multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive \ndevices detonated in and around a refugee camp in Syria near the Jordanian border; \nand in October 2017, two homemade explosive devices were found in another refugee \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \ncamp in Jordan. See Request for Administrative Notice, supra, at 2-3. Also in October \n2017, the State Security Court (SSC) prosecuted six people for sympathizing with ISIS, \nafter they created social media accounts to find Jordanian supporters for ISIS and \npromote terrorist activity. (id.) In September 2017, the SSC charged 16 people with a \nterrorist plot involving the use of automatic weapons to carry out terrorist attacks against \npublic security services; and the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate arrested a \n10-person ISIS cell that was planning to attack security forces and tourist locations \nusing explosive suicide belts. (id) \n \nU.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. Government\u2019s policies on Israel, \nhave fueled anti-American feelings in Jordan. Recent surveys reflect that over 80% of \nthe Jordanian population has an unfavorable view of the U.S. Government. See \nRequest for Administrative Notice, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, supra. The U.S. \nDepartment of State has assessed Amman as being a high-threat location for political \nviolence directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. In December 2017, \nprotests took place at the U.S. Embassy for 27 days after the announcement that the \nU.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem. \n \nAs a regional leader in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Jordan played an \nimportant role in Coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group\u2019s territorial control \nand operational reach. During 2016, Jordanian authorities took legal action against \nnumerous individuals accused of terrorism under Jordanian law.  \n \nOn July 13, 2016, the Jordanian State Security Court filed charges against 21 \nsuspected ISIS affiliates in connection with the pre-emptive March raid on an alleged \nISIS safe house in lrbid. The Department of State assesses that the potential for \nterrorist activity is heightened as Jordan participates in the coalition against ISIS. \nExtremist groups have carried out terrorist activities against U.S. and Jordanian \ngovernment targets in Jordan. \n \nTerrorist groups often do not distinguish between U.S. Government personnel \nand private U.S. citizens, and may target areas frequented by Westerners, such as \ntourist sites, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and transportation hubs. See Jordan \nInternational Travel Information, at 7-10, U.S. Department of State (Dec. 2018)  \n \nAccording to the Department of State 2018 Human Rights Report, Jordan\u2019s most \nsignificant continuing human rights problems include allegations of torture by security \nand government officials; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of activists and \njournalists; infringements on privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of expression; and \nrestrictions on freedom of association and assembly. Impunity remained widespread, \nand the government did not take sufficiently strong steps to investigate, prosecute, or \npunish officials who committed abuses.  See Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices for 2018: Jordan, supra.  \n \nThe Jordanian State Security Court (SSC) took legal action against numerous \nindividuals deemed to be terrorists under local law, including the arrest and prosecution \nof men accused of seeking to join Al-Nusra Front (ANF) and ISIS. Other arrests and \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \nprosecutions involved supporting/recruiting for ISIS and attempted travel to/from Syria in  \nsupport of extremist activities and also for \u201cpropagating ISIL ideology,\u201d a charge often \nused for online activity. See Jordan 2018 Crime and Safety Report, supra, at 4-5) \n \nCountry Status of Israel \n \n \nIsrael is a multi-party parliamentary democracy. See Request for Administrative \nNotice-Israel, at 2 (April 2019) and Israel and the Golan Heights 2018 Human Rights \nReport, U.S. Department of State (March 2019). Israel is a close ally of the United \nStates. Although it has no constitution, Israel\u2019s unicameral 120-member Knesset, has \nenacted a series of \u201cBasic Laws\u201d that enumerate fundamental rights. Implementation of \ncertain fundamental laws, orders, and regulations legally depend on the existence of a \n\u201cstate of emergency,\u201d which has been in effect since 1948. Under the Basic Laws, the \nKnesset has the power to dissolve the government and mandate elections. The \nnationwide Knesset elections in 2015, which were considered free and fair, resulted in a \ncoalition government  led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Knesset voted on \nDecember 26 to dissolve itself and set April 9, 2019, as the date for national elections. \nSee Request for Administrative Notice, Israel, supra. \n \nThe United States and Israel participate in joint military planning and training and \nhave collaborated on military research and weapons development. There have been \nincidents of illegal export, actual or attempted, of dual-use technology from the United \nStates to Israel.  \n \nThe United States has disagreed with Israel about its sale of U.S. and Israeli \ntechnologies to other countries, such as China and Russia. Israel has been subjected to \nnumerous attacks from the Palestinians operating from the Gaza strip. See Request for \nAdministrative Notice-Israel. supra, at 2; Summary of Major U.S. Export Enforcement \nEconomic Espionage, Trade Secret and Embargo-related Criminal Cases, U.S. \nDepartment of Justice at 42-45, 51, and 84 (Jan. 2015) and Don\u2019t Let this Happen to \nYou! Actual Investigations of Export Control and Anti-boycott Violations. (U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce (November 2018). Verified reports are documented of export-\ncontrolled technologies being illegally sent to Israel, including (1) parts used in fighter \njets; (2) a product containing trietanolamine, a Schedule 3 chemical precursor controlled \nfor chemical/biological, antiterrorism, and chemical weapons reasons; (3) pressure \ntransducers controlled for nuclear non-proliferation reasons; and (4) encryption software \nfor national security reasons. See cases supra.  \n \nCountry Status of Iraq \n \n \n \nThe Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The \noutcome of the 2014 parliamentary elections generally met international standards of \nfree and fair elections and led to the peaceful transition of power from former prime \nminister Nuri al-Maliki to prime minister Haider al-Abadi. See Request for Administrative \nNotice-Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) at 2 and 2018 Crime and safety Report: Baghdad, \nU.S. Department of State (Fen 2018).  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nIn 2003, a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and succeeded in removing Saddam \nHussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and political power. See the World \nFactbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. 2018); Background Note, Iraq, at \n3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008).After two years of operations under a provisional \nauthority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in March 2006 (with the approval of \nthe U.S. government), following free elections. (id)  \n \nSince March 2006, the government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad \ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocs. See the \nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 8.  While elections \nhave been held, none of the key constituent groups have been able to form a \ngovernment, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security throughout the \nprovinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile political environment \nin Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that continue to \nunderscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence. \n \nIraq\u2019s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it has for the past \nhalf century since the completion of new pipelines to Lebanon in 1949, and to Syria in \n1952. See the World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra. As a result of \nthe U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered. The \nrebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand since \n2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity. \n \nProposed oil revenue-sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno-\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunni, and Kurds) still awaits passage after  four years of \nstalled negotiations, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such \nlegislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement of the Record, Worldwide \nThreat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence (Jan. 2019)  For the foreseeable future, the national government can be \nexpected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law \nto strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector.  \n \nDespite Iraq\u2019s producing 4.3 million barrels of oil per day, according to published \nreports, Iraq\u2019s population remains poor. See Putting Iraq-KRG\u2019s Oil Relations on Solid \nGround, the Washington Institute on Near East Policy (July 2018) Currently, the case \nbrought by the federal government of Iraq against the KRG in 2012 over the legality of \nthe KRG\u2019s oil contracts and independent exports remains pending with no predictable \noutcome in the near future. See id.  \n \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the KRG to \ncontribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s overall exports (a law that would \nseem to legitimate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk oil) have never led federal \nauthorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s federal authorities have \nseverely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking \nthe oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq\u2019s federal government \ncan have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq and its oil exports, but for the \nUnited States and other Western interests as well. \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nTerrorism and human rights issues \n \nDespite recent developments in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a \nvery dangerous, volatile, and unpredictable country. The U.S. State Department \ncontinues to strongly warn U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq. See Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Iraq, at 3-4; Travel Advisory-Iraq, U.S. Department of State (May \n2019) The State Department assessed Iraq as being a critical-threat location for crime \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. interests. See 2019 Crime and Safety Report: \nBaghdad at 2-3, U.S. Department of State (Feb 2019). While crime statistics and crime \nreporting mechanisms are incomplete and inconsistent, the vast majority of individuals \nunder contract with, or employed by, the U.S. Government in Iraq are required to travel \nwith a protective security detail, so as to limit potential criminal threats against them. \n(id.) \n \nAttacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue and include \nsites and facilities where foreign tourists frequently visit: hotels, restaurants, police \nstations, check points, foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations, and \nother locations with expatriate personnel. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq, \nsupra; Travel Advisory-Iraq, supra. The U.S. Embassy\u2019s ability to provide consular \nservices to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad is extremely limited under the security \nenvironment that still exists in Iraq. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq, supra; \nCountry Information: Iraq: Safety and Security, U.S. Dept. of State (June 2018).The \nU.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. personnel in \nIraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security \nguidelines. To deal with expanded terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens in Iraq, \ntemporary movement restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel (both inside and outside \nthe international zone) have been imposed. See Iraq 2019 Crime and Safety Report, \nsupra.  \n \nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing \nWaiver Program. See Request for Administrative Notice, supra, at 4-5. Under the 2015 \namendment, citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria are ineligible to travel or be \nadmitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program.  \n \nIraq\u2019s human rights record remains a poor one. Based on the U.S. State \nDepartment\u2019s most recent annual human rights report, violence continued throughout \n2017-2018, largely fueled by the actions of the Islamic state in Iraq (ISIS). See Request \nfor Administrative Notice, Iraq, supra, at 3-4; Statement for the Record, Worldwide \nThreat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence (Jan. 2019). After liberating all territory taken by ISIS by the end of 2017, \nIraqi Security Forces (ISF) have continued to pursue and restrict ISIS forces still active \nin Iraq. \n \nReports of human rights abuses also include allegations of unlawful killings by \nsome members of the ISF (particularly by some members of the Popular Mobilization \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \nforces), torture, harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities, \ncriminalization of libel and other limits on freedom of expression, widespread corruption, \ngreatly reduced penalties for so-called honor killings, coerced or forced abortions \nimposed by ISIS on its victims, legal restrictions imposed on the freedom of movement \nof women, and trafficking in persons. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq, \nsupra; Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018: Iraq, U.S. Department of \nState (March 2019) \n \nCurrent U.S. Relations with Iraq \n \nThe U.S. mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership \nwith Iraq and the Iraqi people. See U.S. Relations with Iraq at 1-2, U.S. Department of \nState (July 2018). In coordination with the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS, the United \nStates assisted Iraq\u2019s efforts to achieve the long-sought goal of liberating all of Iraqi \nterritory from ISIS. The Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the \nUnited States provides the basis of the United States\u2019 bilateral relationship with Iraq and \ncovers a wide range of bilateral issues, including political relations and diplomacy, \ndefense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, \nservices, science, culture, education, and environment. (id.) \n \nU.S. bilateral assistance to Iraq is considerable and stresses economic reform, \nassistance to vulnerable groups, and democracy and governance. See U.S. Relations \nwith Iraq, supra. U.S. security assistance supports the development of modern, \naccountable, fiscally sustainable, and professional Iraqi military resources capable of \ndefending Iraq and its borders. The United States has designated Iraq as a beneficiary \ndeveloping country under the Generalized System of Preferences Program and has \nbeen proactive in the promotion of two-way trade between the United States and Iraq. \n(id., at 2)  \n \nNoteworthy, Iraq\u2019s re-integration into the international community has been \nmarked by their demonstrated cooperation with international institutions, including the \nUnited Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the Arab League. (id.) \nBased on a consideration of the developed record, heightened risks associated with  \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s ownership interest of land in Iraq are insubstantial.  \n \nRecent attacks by Iranian militia groups on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad \nstrongly illustrate the threat that Iran poses to U.S. security interests in Iraq. See R. \nBurns & E. Knickmeyer, Attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Demonstrates Tough \nChoices for President Trump, Time (Jan. 2020) In a public statement, President Trump \nheld Iran fully responsible for the attack, but stopped short of suggesting any military \nretaliation would be forthcoming. (id.)  The breach of the U.S. Embassy compound in \nearly January 2020, which prompted the United States to send military reinforcements, \nbut caused no known U.S. casualties or evacuations, also revealed growing strains \nbetween the United States and Iraq and raised questions and concerns about the future \nof the U.S. military mission in the country. Currently, the United States has about 5,200 \ntroops in Iraq, whose mission lies mainly in training Iraqi forces and helping them \ncombat ISIS extremists in the region. (id.)  \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nTensions with Iran have escalated since the Embassy breach, with the directed \ndrone strike by President Trump that killed Iraq\u2019s top general Quasem Soleimani and his \ndeputy (Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis), a leading Iraqi militia leader, along with eight people. \nSee Wall Street Journal. and other news accounts of the drone strike. Iran has \nresponded to the drone strike with threats of harsh revenge on U.S. military \ninstallations.  \n \nAnticipating retaliatory attacks on U.S. diplomatic and military personnel in the \nregion, the United States announced its intended deployments of additional troops to \nmeet whatever retaliatory challenges the United States may face from Iran.  See Wall \nStreet Journal and other news accounts. Secretary of State Pompeo and other high-\nranking DoD officials have characterized the drone strike as defensive action to protect \nU.S. diplomatic and military personnel abroad, and reaffirmed U.S. commitments to de-\nescalation. See CNN and other news reports.  \n \nIn a region still on edge from the killing of Iran\u2019s most prominent military leader, \nIranian officials and President Trump traded threats of escalating military action. Other \naccounts from Iraq confirmed that the killing of Soleimani on Iraqi soil and the earlier \nU.S. airstrikes that killed 25 members of the Kataib Hezballah militia have fueled calls \nfor the expulsion of U.S. troops from Iraq. See CNN and other news accounts of \nunfolding events in Iraq. Published suggestions of a U.S. troop withdrawal in response \nto a previous passage of a non-binding Iraq resolution calling for the expelling of all \nforeign troops from Iraq have since been reversed by the Pentagon. See Wall Street \nJournal. and CNN reports and other news sources. And, in Iran, reports have circulated \nthat a successor to General Soleimani as Iran\u2019s Quds force commander has been \nappointed. (id.) \n \nKeeping with its threats to mount retaliatory attacks against U.S. military facilities, \nIran struck the highly fortified U.S.-Iraq Green Zone of Baghdad with a barrage of \nrockets before pulling back. See Wall Street Journal and other news sources. While \nboth the United States and Iran can claim strategic returns as they pulled back from the \nbrink of war, the longstanding competing goals of these longstanding adversaries \nremain. The United States wants Iran to return to the table to renegotiate the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program that the \nUnited States, its allies, and Iran agreed to in April 2015. Iran and its proxies, by \ncontrast, seek the expelling of U.S. forces from not only Iraq, but the entire Middle East \nregion. See Wall Street Journal and other news sources. Their stated goals are not \neasily reconcilable and will require sustained efforts on both sides to revise their \nstructures of conflict and diplomatic disconnects. Only time will tell what, when, and how \nthey can reconcile their differences in accordance with international norms of state \nconduct.  \n \nCharacter references \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by her supervisors, colleagues, friends, and family \nmembers who know her and are aware of her situation.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                              \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe Concern:  Foreign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nBurdens of Proof \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1.  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                              \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

She has a half-brother who is a dual citizen and resident of Israel and \nJordan and a half-sister who is a citizen and resident of Israel. Applicant\u2019s husband \nowns an inherited interest in one-third of one-sixth of an undivided large tract of land in \nIraq, whose estimated worth is $500,000 USD. Applicant has no control (either \nindividually or jointly with his siblings) over the management and sales of the property \nand cannot estimate when additional acreage of the tract might be sold.  \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant and her husband own a small piece of property in Jordan \nthat they purchased in 2011. This property is modestly valued at around $24,000 USD \nand remains in the possession and control of Applicant and her husband. Besides their \nproperty interests in Iraq and Jordan, Applicant\u2019s husband has a pension entitlement \n(valued at $340 a month USD) from an employee\u2019s union in Jordan that he expects to \nbegin receiving payments from in 2020. Security concerns are raised under the foreign \ninfluence guideline due to Applicant\u2019s longstanding family ties to Israel and Jordan, and \ndue to her husband\u2019s real estate interests in Iraq and pension expectancy in Jordan.  \n \n \nKey to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are Applicant\u2019s extended \nfamily members (a half-brother and half-sister) who reside in Israel. Despite \nencouraging developments in Jordan, Iraq and Israel, each of the countries presents \ncertain heightened risks. In Jordan and Iraq, terrorist attacks and human rights abuses \nhave considerable histories. Terrorist attacks from the Palestinians operating from the \nGaza strip have long plagued Israel, and there have been verified incidents of illegal l \nexporting of dual-use technology by Israel. Because the three countries involved \n(Jordan, Israel, and Iraq) all present some heightened security risks for applicants who \nhave family and property interests in some or all of the countries, Applicant is exposed \nto authorities in these countries who might use improper and/or illegal means to obtain \nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control through her half siblings and \nhusband with ties to one or all of the respective countries.   \n \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s contacts with her half-siblings are infrequent, they are \nlongstanding. And, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country has ties of affection for, or obligation to, her \nimmediate family members, and this presumption covers in-laws (to include Applicant\u2019s \nextended family members residing in Jordan and Iraq) and half siblings who reside in \nIsrael. ISCR case No. 07-06030 at 3 (app. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (May 15, 2018)(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002) \n \nTo be sure, the risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if \nthe foreign country has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of \nlaw including widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. With \nrespect to Jordan, Israel, and Iraq, none of these countries are free from risks of \npotential hostage taking. Each of these countries, though, maintains strong bilateral \nrelations with the United States and recognizes democratic principles of governance.  \n \nTaken together, the personal and financial relationships Applicant has with \nJordan, Israel, and Iraq, and the situations that exist in those countries, places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her relationship with \nany family member living in those countries and property interests she and her husband \nhave in them do not pose irreconcilable security risks. Such risks that cannot be \nreconciled or otherwise mitigated could potentially place her in a position of having to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Jordan, Israel, or Iraq, or to take actions to protect her property interests (directly \nor indirectly) in any of these countries.  \n \n \nFurther, while Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s property interests in Iraq and jointly held \nproperty in Jordan are relatively small by comparison to their corresponding property \ninterests in the United States, they still present some potential for irreconcilable conflicts \nof interest. For these reasons, the Government urges security concerns over risks that \nApplicant and her family and property interests in Jordan, Israel, and Iraq might be \nsubject to exploitation, coercion or duress by civilian or military authorities in these \ncountries to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. \nApplicant\u2019s family ties and property interests (both direct and indirect through her \nhusband) warrant some application of two of the disqualifying conditions of the foreign \ninfluence guideline DC  \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and 7(b), \u201cconnections to \na foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of \ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information \nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.\u201d \n \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nApplicable, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation is \u00b6 7(f), \u201dsubstantial business, financial, \nor property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest.\u201d The reported property interest of Applicant\u2019s husband in an \nundivided one-third of one-sixth tract of land in Iraq that he shares with his sister and \nbrother (both U.S. citizens) is worth in excess of $500,000 USD, and has netted him \n$150,000 USD this year in distributed proceeds from his relatives in Iraq who control the \nproperty and any distributions of proceeds netted from sales. Neither Applicant\u2019s \nhusband nor siblings have any control over this tract of land.  \n \n \nPotentially covered as well by \u00b6 7(f)\u2019s conflict of interest disqualifier are  \nApplicant\u2019s residence purchased by Applicant\u2019s husband in Jordan for investment \npurposes in 2011 (worth $24,011 USD) and the prospective retirement benefits (valued \nat $340 USD a month) that Applicant\u2019s husband expects to receive in 2020 from an \nemployee\u2019s union in Jordan. Neither of these property interests represent significant \nproperty interests and warrant only partial application of \u00b6 7(f). \n \n \nTrue, none of Applicant\u2019s half-siblings in Israel have any history to date of being \nsubjected to any coercion or pressure. These historical antecedents limit the risk of any \npotential conflict situation. And, while the absence of any past coercive measures taken \nby Israeli authorities does not absolve Applicant from any coercive risks in the future \ngiven Israel\u2019s checkered history of collection interests in the United States, the risks of \nany coercive measures being taken against these half-siblings minimizes any potential \nrisks.  \n \n \nStill, the nature of the foreign government (Jordan, Israel, and Iraq in this case), \nthe intelligence-gathering and human rights history of the country (or countries) in issue, \nand the country\u2019s government relations with the United States are among the most \nimportant considerations to be considered when assessing risks associated with an \napplicant\u2019s family ties and property interests in that country. See ISCR Case No. 16-\n02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018)(citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. March 13, \n2017) Each of the three countries at issue have maintained good bilateral relations with \nthe United States. While the recent reports of attacks and counterattacks on Iraqi \ntargets raise concerns over the future of the U.S. presence in the country in the wake of \nIraq\u2019s being drawn into the unfolding military recriminations from the U.S. drone strikes \non Soleimani on Iraqi soil, to date the status of the United States presence and role in \nIraq has not been reversed or changed in any manifest way. \n \n \nAlthough, Applicant\u2019s family and property interests in Jordan, Israel, and Iraq, \nrespectfully, place her in a position of having to carry her burden of persuasion that \nnone of her family or property interests in those countries pose any irreconcilable \nsecurity risks, she should not be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States \nand a desire to assist or maintain contact with a relative living in any of these countries, \nor retain property interests in any of these countries that are not shown to present a \nrealistic risk of a conflict.  \n \n\n \n18 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nMitigation is available to Applicant under the foreign influence guideline of her \nAGs. Based on her case-specific circumstances, mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe United States,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n \nThe resident status of Applicant\u2019s half-siblings in Israel, the ownership interests \nof Applicant\u2019s husband in Iraq and Jordan, and the relatively small pension benefits that \nher husband stands to receive from an employees union in Jordan, beginning in 2020, \ncreate no more than remote risks of a conflict situation that could place Applicant in a \nposition that could force her to choose between her personal interests and the security \ninterests of the United States. Given the substantial financial and family ties that \nApplicant and her husband enjoy in the United States, any potential conflicts that \nApplicant could potentially face with her half-siblings in Israel, her husband\u2019s property \ninterests in Iraq, her joint property interest in Jordan, and her husband\u2019s relatively small \npension benefit from Jordan, respectively, promise to be minor and reconcilable with \nApplicant\u2019s sizable family and personal financial interests in the United States.  \n \n \nBecause neither Applicant\u2019s relationships with her half-siblings nor her property \ninterests in any of these countries (direct or indirect through her husband) are \nsignificant, the risks of her having to make personal choices incompatible with U.S. \nsecurity interests are minimal. Based on the evidence compiled in this record, safe \npredictions can be made about the future safety of Applicant\u2019s half-siblings in Israel and \nher ability to protect the property interests of herself and her husband against any \neconomic pressures brought to bear on her by government officials from any of the \nthree countries addressed.  \n \n \nOther mitigating conditions available to Applicant are \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d and 8(f), \u201cthe \nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such \nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d  In Applicant\u2019s case, she has demonstrated little \ncontact with her half-siblings residing in Israel (last seen at a wedding in Jordan in \n2017). And, the property interests she and her husband share in Iraq and Jordan \nrespectively, are relatively small when compared with the values of her residence, \nretirement benefits, and her husband\u2019s pension benefits from his work in their state of \nresidence. With an estimated net worth of over $1.3 million, Applicant\u2019s financial \ninterests in the United States leave her husband and herself with too much to gain from \ntheir chosen state of residence to leave them vulnerable to risks of foreign influence, \nmanipulation, or pressure.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to her relatives living in Israel and property \ninterest in Jordan and Iraq, respectively, are less significant than her connections to her \nfamily members and financial interests in the United States. Her husband\u2019s past support \n\n \n19 \n                                                                                                                                              \nof the U.S. Government as a transportation engineer for the U.S. State Department \nassisting the Iraqi government in its reconstruction efforts, the U.S. birth citizenship of \nherself and two of her children, and the naturalized U.S citizenship of her husband and \nthird child are important factors in weighing the merits of mitigating foreign influence-\nbased security concerns.  \n \nTo be sure, Applicant has not visited her relatives in Israel and Jordan in over \ntwo years and maintains infrequent contact with them. Her husband has no control over \ndecisions on the tract of land he shares ownership with other family members in Iraq, \nand the property she owns with her husband in Jordan is relatively small. Given these \ncollective circumstances, Applicant\u2019s substantial  connections to the United States when \nconsidered together with her foreign connections are sufficient to overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns under Guideline B.   \n \nWhole-person assessment \n \n \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain \nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance takes account of the U.S. citizenship of Applicant, her husband, and her three \nchildren. Applicant is a 49-year-old financial analyst for a defense contractor with two \nhalf-siblings: one a dual citizen of Israel and Jordan and another who is a citizen and \nresident of Israel. While she owns property interests in Iraq and Jordan through her \nhusband, most of her financial interests are situated in the United States. Applicant \nmaintains infrequent contact with her half-siblings in Israel and neither provides nor \nreceives financial support from them.  \n \nBased on the evidence presented, there is no evidence that her relatives residing \nin Israel are government employees or military personnel. Nor do any of these half-\nsiblings have any ties or connections to Israel or Jordan. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s \nhonorable service to the U.S. State Department as a transportation attach\u00e9 in Iraq is \nwell noted and a good indicator of his loyalties to the United States. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Jordan, Israel, and Iraq must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situation and dangers in all three countries. Jordan and Iraq  \nare still countries that pose some heightened risks despite their strong bilateral \nrelationships with the United States. Terrorists continue to threaten the interests of the \nUnited States in these countries, and Israel remains a reported major collector of \nintelligence information in the United States and its allies, and those who cooperate and \nassist the United States. Jordan and Iraq do not fully comply with the rule of law or protect \ncivil liberties in many instances. Still, based on the developed record, all three \ngovernments of these countries remain allies in the war on terrorism. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n\n \n20 \n                                                                                                                                              \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/06/2019 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted two security clearance applications, a Standard Form (SF) \n85P on May 22, 2017, and a SF86 on October 29, 2017. On May 9, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 27, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On July 24, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 11. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on August 6, 2019 \n\n \n2 \n \nand timely submitted his response on September 4, 2019, to which the Government did \nnot object. Items 1 through 3 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 4 through 11 are \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included documents that were marked \nand admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. His FORM response \nincluded documents that were marked and admitted into evidence as AE C and D. The \ncase was assigned to me on October 3, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 3), his \nSF85P (Item 4), his SF86 (Item 5), and the summaries of his security clearance \ninterviews (SI) in June 2017 (Item 6) and in November 2018 (Item 7). Items 6 and 7 \nwere not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Items 6 and 7. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItems 6 and 7 on the ground that they were not authenticated. Applicant was also \nnotified that if he did not raise any objection to Items 6 or 7 in his response to the \nFORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived \nany such objection, and that Items 6 and 7 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nApplicant responded to the FORM, but raised no objections. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 43, is married with three minor children. His youngest child, age \n10, has special needs. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 2015. He has \nmaintained steady full-time employment since at least September 2006. He also had a \npart-time job for an unspecified period of time in 2009. He has been employed as an \naircraft mechanic by a defense contractor since December 2010. He served honorably \nin the Air Force, from 1999 through 2005, and in the Air National Guard, from 2005 \nthrough 2011. He was previously granted a security clearance in 1999. His last \nbackground investigation occurred in about 2011 or 2012. (Item 4 at 18; Item 6 at 3; \nItem 7 at 1-2) \n \nApplicant accrued 30 delinquent debts after a 2010 chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge (SOR \u00b6 1.a), including a $14,782 car loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.b), 15 federal \nstudent loan accounts totaling $52,405 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.q), a $296 credit-card account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.r), a $256 satellite-television account (SOR \u00b6 1.x), and 12 medical accounts \ntotaling $2,819. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s \u2013 1.w and 1.y \u2013 1.ee). (AE D; Items 8 and 9) \n \nApplicant resolved the delinquent status of all 15 student-loan accounts by \nconsolidating them in February 2019. As of June 2019, he was current with his monthly \npayment of $67, and had a remaining balance of $48,815. In June 2017, Applicant \nclaimed to have arranged to pay $50 per month to resolve the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, but he never submitted either evidence of actual payments made or a plan to \notherwise resolve the debt. In his SOR answer, Applicant articulated a reasonable basis \nto dispute the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x, but did not provide substantiating documents. \nIn his FORM response, he acknowledged that debt and proffered a plan to repay it \n\n \n3 \n \nalong with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r and the 12 medical debts. He did not proffer a \nreasonable basis for the dispute noted on his August 2019 credit report of the $123 \nmedical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. His unresolved SOR debts total $18,153. (FORM \nresponse; SOR answer; AE A; AE D at 70; Item 6 at 6; Item 10 at 2-4, 6-8) \n \nApplicant attributed the 2010 bankruptcy to his and his wife\u2019s unemployment. He \nfiled the petition in October 2009, claiming liabilities of $200,637, including student-loan \naccounts totaling $90,381. He received the credit counseling required by the court in \n2009. Except for the student-loan accounts, his debts were discharged in January 2010. \n(Item 6 at 3 and 5; Item 7 at 3; Item 11)   \n \nApplicant asserted that his inability to resolve the student-loan debts and the \naccumulation of new debts after the bankruptcy discharge were caused by his wife\u2019s \nvoluntarily unemployment to care for their special-needs child full time, their complete \nfinancial support of his wife\u2019s parents, and the extraordinary medical expenses \nassociated with their child\u2019s special needs. He also acknowledged that he prioritized \nsaving funds for a 20% down payment on a home that was purchased in May 2017. The \ndetails of that purchase were not specified in the record. (AE B; Item 6 at 3 and 5; Item \n7 at 3) \n \nDuring his November 2018 SI, Applicant admitted that he was still struggling \nfinancially. However, the record did not otherwise specify a timeline for the \ncircumstances to which he attributed his financial problems or any details associated \nwith his relevant income and expense history. The Government enumerated various \ndeficiencies in Applicant\u2019s mitigation evidence and advised him of the opportunity to \naddress those deficiencies and submit supporting documentation in his FORM \nresponse. However, Applicant did not fully avail himself of that opportunity. \n \nIn his FORM response, Applicant stated the following in support of mitigation: 1) \nhe lives within his means and does not spend frivolously; 2) his current debts include \none credit card ($22/month payment, $750 balance), an almost paid-off car loan for a \n13-year-old car with 200,000 miles ($191/month payment, $695 balance), and one \npersonal loan he used to repair that car to keep it running ($325/month payment, $2,015 \nbalance); 3) his wife assumed their home-mortgage debt following their \u201crecent \nseparation;\u201d 4) he attended financial planning classes at his church and developed a \n\u201cDave Ramsey\u201d repayment plan to resolve his delinquent debts in \u201cbaby steps\u201d by \npaying them off from smallest to largest; and 5) he established a budget with a timeline \nto repay certain creditors. (AE D at 4-6) \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated August 2019 revealed a $64 utility debt (which \nappeared on a January 2018 credit report, but was not alleged in the SOR) and six new \nmedical debts totaling $1,883. In his FORM response, Applicant proffered a plan to \nrepay the utility debt, but did not specifically address the new medical debts. The \nGovernment also did not allege two medical debts totaling $514 from a July 2019 credit \nreport. I will consider any debts not alleged in the SOR only to evaluate mitigation and \nthe whole-person concept. (AE D at 63, 66-69, 71-72; Item 8 at 20; Item 10 at 2) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor, a retired military officer who commanded at the battalion level, \nhas known him for over 10 years. He corroborated that Applicant does not live above \nhis financial means or spend frivolously. He is certain that Applicant is loyal to his \ncountry and his employer. (AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n5 \n \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy and his subsequent delinquent debts, which were \ncorroborated by his admissions and credit reports, establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n6 \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant is credited with resolving the delinquent status of his student loans. \nBecause bankruptcy is an acceptable form of debt resolution, the concern is not with the \nbankruptcy itself, but with the underlying history of financial indebtedness that has \npersisted. Accordingly, I find the allegations concerning the bankruptcy and student \nloans in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to begin tackling his other delinquent debts are commendable, \nbut fell short of establishing mitigation sufficient to overcome his extended history of \nfinancial problems. The special needs of Applicant\u2019s child are compelling circumstances \nand have undoubtedly had both a monetary and nonmonetary impact on the family. \nHowever, the record evidence lacks important details about the specific financial impact \nthose needs and his various other circumstances had on the accrual of Applicant\u2019s post-\nbankruptcy debts and his ability to repay them.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant is not required to be debt-free in order to qualify for a security \nclearance, he failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly to address his non-student loan debts, particularly since he prioritized \nsaving for a home over obligations to his creditors. He is on the right track by taking \nfinancial education classes, creating a budget, and developing a repayment plan. \nHowever, there is no evidence that he is following through with the plan or that his \nfinances are otherwise under control. He has not resolved one single non-student loan \ndebt, including the smallest $64 account. Moreover, he has continued to accrue new \ndelinquent debts. Thus, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant \nhas mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.q:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r \u2013 1.ee:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 25, 2018. On May 1, \n2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 31, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 11, 2019, and \nthe case was assigned to me on July 23, 2019. On August 7, 2019, the Defense Office of \n\n \n2 \n \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nAugust 29, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 14 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. I kept the \nrecord open until September 30, 2019, to enable him to submit additional documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted AX F through P, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 9, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.d. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e-1.h. His admissions in his \nanswer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor since June \n2018. He was born in Afghanistan. After his father was killed, his family fled from \nAfghanistan in 1997 to escape from the Taliban. They lived in Pakistan for about three \nyears and then came to the United States in July 2001. Applicant attended high school in \nthe United States from August 2003 to June 2006, and became a U.S. citizen in \nDecember 2007.  \n \nApplicant has never married and has no children. He has three brothers, ages 29, \n26, and 23. (Tr. 44.) When he is not deployed overseas, he lives in a rental home with his \nmother and his youngest brother. (Tr. 32.) \n \nApplicant attended a university in the United States from August 2006 to May 2010, \nbut did not receive a degree. He worked as a linguist for a defense contractor and was \ndeployed to Afghanistan from September 2010 to January 2012, and his gross income \nwas about $11,400 per month during this deployment. (Tr. 42.) He used his income to \nsupport his mother and his three brothers, who were all in college at the time. (Tr. 43-44.) \nAfter Applicant returned from Afghanistan, he and a friend (a Marine Corps veteran) \nstarted a business, but it failed after about six months. (Tr. 43.) He worked for a non-\ngovernment employer for one month as a cultural role player. He was unemployed from \nMarch 2012 to March 2013. He worked for a U.S. Government agency as a seasonal \nemployee from April to July 2013. He was unemployed from August 2013 to March 2014. \nHe was self-employed part time as a driver for a ride-sharing company from April 2014 to \nJuly 2016, while he was in college. He worked for a defense contractor as a cultural role \nplayer for one month in the spring of 2016.  \n \nApplicant completed college and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2016 and \nwas unemployed until he found part-time and intermittent work in the non-federal sector \nfrom November 2016 to June 2018. His annual income during this period was less than \n$30,000. (Tr. 36.) He has worked for defense contractors since June 2018. He has never \nheld a security clearance. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had been deployed to Afghanistan since \nMarch 2019. He came to the United States for his hearing and then returned to \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 30-31.) While in Afghanistan, he frequently deploys to remote areas for \nlong periods, without access to email, and documents sent by postal service take 10-15 \ndays to reach him. The limited email and postal service make it difficult for him to \ncommunicate with creditors. (Tr. 10-11.) He intends to enlist the assistance of his brothers \nin communicating with creditors. His current contract expires in March 2020, and he \nexpects it to be renewed as long as there is a continuing need for linguists. (Tr. 64-65.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $25,000. The evidence \nconcerning the debts in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card account referred for collection of $7,957. Applicant fell \nbehind on his payments in 2016 because of his limited income. When he reduced the \namounts of his payments, the interest increased. He contacted the creditor but was \nunable to reach an agreement. (Tr. 48.) The creditor sued him in December 2018. In \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer, he stated that he was contesting the amount of this debt and \nthat a court hearing was set for June 24, 2019. Applicant\u2019s attorney failed to appear, \napparently due to miscommunication about the dates of Applicant\u2019s deployment, and a \ndefault judgment was entered. Applicant contacted the court clerk and obtained the forms \nto request that the case be reopened for a hearing. However, he has not filed the motion \nto reopen the case, because the hearing would be within 60 days after the motion is filed \nand Applicant will still be in Afghanistan. He intends to file the motion upon his return to \nthe United States. (AX F; AX J.) If the debt is not otherwise resolved, he intends to \nnegotiate a payment plan. (Tr. 50.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: student loan referred for collection of $6,013. Applicant began a \nrehabilitation program in September 2018 and made $5 payments by automatic debit from \nhis account from October 2018 through June 2019. He has completed the rehabilitation \nprogram for this loan. His new payments have not yet been determined. (AX A; AX H.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account referred for collection of $890. After obtaining \nthis credit card, Applicant disputed the annual fees, to which he had not agreed, and the \nissuer removed the annual fees. After Applicant closed the account, the fees were \nreinstated. When Applicant learned that a default judgment had been entered against \nhim, he requested a hearing and appeared in court. (GX 14 at 21.) On June 8, 2018, the \ncollection agency\u2019s lawsuit was non-suited. (AX K.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $823. In Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer, he stated that he believed the account had been paid off and closed and that he \nwould contact the creditor and resolve it. As of the date the record closed, it was not yet \nresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h: medical bills referred for collection of $631 and $649. \nThese debts arose when Applicant thought he had food poisoning and went to the \nemergency room. He did not have health insurance. (GX 14 at 22; Tr. 58.) He made \n\n \n4 \n \npayment agreements for these bills and made the final payment on one of them in May \n2019 and the other in June 2019. The debts are resolved.  (AX C through E and AX G.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g: student loans referred for collection of $5,587 and $2,235. \nApplicant began a rehabilitation program for these loans on September 25, 2019, and has \nmade the first payment. (AX I; AX H.) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, he provided a list of his current revolving \ncredit accounts. His documents reflect that all his credit-card accounts are current and in \ngood standing. (AX F; AX L through O.) His current gross income is about $74,000 per \nyear. Now that his siblings have completed their education, they provide most of their \nmother\u2019s financial support. His net monthly remainder is about $4,000, which he believes \nis sufficient to enable him to enter into payment agreements for his unresolved debts. (Tr. \n59-62.) He has never sought or obtained financial counseling. (GX 14 at 22.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s team commander in Afghanistan, an Army major, submitted a letter \nrecommending that his application for a security clearance be granted. (AX P.) His \ncomments include the following: \n \n[Applicant] is an incredible linguist and has provided direct positive impacts \nto our mission in a very forward, and often dangerous environment. He has \nproven to be one of the most effective linguists I have worked with in my \nthree deployments to Afghanistan. His cultural understanding of both \nAmerican and Afghan culture makes him an invaluable asset. Because of \nthe close interaction and demonstrated commitment to our mission, I am \nwriting you to strongly support [Applicant] and recommend him for a secret \nclearance. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n6 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment, his failed business venture, and his deployment to remote locations \nwhere he could not communicate with creditors were conditions largely beyond his \ncontrol. He has acted responsibly by remaining in contact with his creditors to the best of \nhis ability, negotiating payment plans, and paying most of his debts. \n\n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.h, 1.f, and \n1.g. Applicant has either paid or is making payments on each of these debts. He has not \nresolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. However, the adjudicative guidelines do not \nrequire that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the \ndebts alleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. \nHe or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, \n2008).  \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant incurred the credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d for basic living \nexpenses during his periods of unemployment and underemployment and not for \nextravagant luxuries. He has lived frugally and has methodically addressed each of his \ndebts. He has only two unresolved debts, which he is addressing to the best of his ability \nwhile deployed. Now that he has found full-time employment, he has the financial ability \nto resolve the remaining two debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant successfully \ncontested an annual fee to which he had not agreed. It is not established for the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant has disputed the amount of the debt, but he has not provided a \ndocumented basis for his dispute. He recognizes that he may not prevail, and he is \nprepared to negotiate a payment plan if necessary. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant is well-regarded by his military \nsupervisor in Afghanistan. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \n\n \n8 \n \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/29/2019 \n______________\nDecision \n______________\nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 13, 2018. On \nApril 10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 1, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. On May 30, 2019, the Government sent a complete copy of its \nwritten case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 5, to Applicant. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 6, 2019, and did not respond. \n\n \n2 \n \nItem 1 contains the two pleadings in the case. Items 2 through and 5 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on July 17, 2019. \nProcedural Matter \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 1), his \nSCA (Item 2), and a summary of his security clearance interview (SI) (Item 3). Item 3 was \nnot authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant \nwaived any objection to Item 3. The Government included a separate footnote entitled \n\u201cIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT\u201d in the FORM to notify Applicant of his right to \nobject to the admissibility of Item 3 on the ground that it was not authenticated. In that \nparagraph, Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise any objection to Item 3 in \nhis response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered \nto have waived any such objection, and that Item 3 could be considered as evidence in \nhis case. Applicant received the FORM, which included a copy of Item 3. He did not \nrespond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item 3.  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 43, has been in a relationship analogous to marriage since 2015. \nHis was previously married from 2000 through 2008. He has three minor children and one \nadult child. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1994 until 1996, when \nhe was discharged due to medical injuries. His Department of Veterans Affairs disability \nrating is 30%. He received a high school diploma in 1994, and attended community \ncollege from 2008 through 2012. He has been employed full time as a material rigger by \na defense contractor since April 2018. He reported no prior security clearances. \nApplicant admitted each of the debts alleged in the SOR totaling approximately \n$56,402 including: a $17,868 child support account (SOR \u00b6 1.a), six federal student loan \naccounts totaling $28,434 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.f and 1.h), 22 medical accounts totaling $3,659 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \u2013 1.ff), a $3,321 automobile loan account (SOR \u00b6 1.g), a $1,698 personal \nloan account (SOR \u00b6 1.i), and one $1,422 retail charge account (SOR \u00b6 1.j). While \nApplicant reported no periods of unemployment, he attributed his financial indebtedness \nto a period beginning in 2016 when his income was reduced due to the lack of availability \nof full-time hours and continuing through a 2018 layoff. In November 2018, Applicant \nreported that he was gainfully employed and had \u201cthe means\u201d and willingness to resolve \nhis delinquent debts. He also claimed numerous actions that had either been taken or \nwould be taken to resolve his delinquent debts. (Item 1 and 3). \nApplicant\u2019s child support debt resulted from an arrearage owed. The record is \nunclear as to which child or children it relates, or to what financial issue it can be attributed \nbecause Applicant provided inconsistent explanations between his SCA, SI, and SOR \nAnswer. In addition to an ongoing voluntary wage garnishment, in 2016 and 2017, his \nfederal tax returns were garnished and applied to repay the debt. Without providing any \nsubstantiating documents, he claimed that the balance had been reduced to \u201c$10,000 or \nless\u201d as of April 2019, and that the wage garnishment had been \u201cconsistently\u201d paid during \nthe past eight to ten years. (Item 1 at 5, Item 2 at 35, Item 3 at 10, Item 4 at 3). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loan accounts were opened in 2011 and 2012. They were \nplaced in deferment status in 2018 and rehabilitated as of April 2019. As of May 2019, \nthe accounts were reported as no longer in delinquent status. (Item 1 at 5-6, Item 3 at 9-\n10, Item 4 at 4-5, Item 5 at 4-5).  \nDuring his November 2018 SI, Applicant stated that his medical debts were being \nconsolidated and would be paid in full. The record does not specify on whose behalf or \nthe reason these debts were incurred. In his May 2019 SOR Answer, he stated that he \nwas \u201cgetting in contact\u201d with his creditors to resolve the accounts in phases, ranging from \n\u201cwithin the next month\u201d to \u201cby the end of this year.\u201d (Item 1 at 6-8, Item 3 at 5-9; Item 5 at \n1 and 2).  \nApplicant\u2019s automobile loan account resulted from a voluntary repossession \nfollowing a blown engine. He financed the vehicle in 2014 for $5,202. The account was \ncharged off in 2017 in the amount of $3,321. Applicant believed that the creditor resold \nthe vehicle and acknowledged \u201can amount owed,\u201d but did not specify it. Applicant took on \na $10,825 personal loan with the same creditor in 2014. The loan was to be repaid in \n$257 monthly payments over 48 months. The account was charged off in 2017 in the \namount of $1,698. During his November 2018 SI, Applicant stated that he was working \nwith the creditor to pay both debts. In his May 2019 SOR Answer, he stated that he was \n\u201cgetting in contact\u201d with the creditor to set up a payment plan to resolve both debts by the \nend of the 2019. (Item 1 at 5 and 6, Item 3 at 9, Item 4 at 5). \nApplicant opened a retail charge account in 2014 with a $1,000 credit limit. The \naccount was charged off in 2017 in the amount of $1,422. During his November 2018 SI, \nApplicant stated that he was willing to pay this debt. In his May 2019 SOR Answer, he \nstated that he had been in contact with the creditor who offered a settlement and planned \nto pay the debt by the end of the 2019. (Item 1 at 6, Item 3 at 9, Item 4 at 6, and Item 5 \nat and 5).  \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n \n5 \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations). \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI credit Applicant with rehabilitating his delinquent student loans and find the \nallegations concerning those debts in his favor. However, substantial debts remain \nunresolved. He did not provide sufficient evidence for me to conclude that his child \nsupport debt is current or to establish the ongoing payments he allegedly made. While he \nis not required to be debt-free in order to qualify for a security clearance, he failed to \ndemonstrate that he acted responsibly to address his debt. Despite being gainfully \nemployed with the means to pay his debts since at least November 2018, he has not paid \na single debt. Thus, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by \nhis financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1f:  For Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1ff:  Against Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 28, has worked for a federal contracting company as a mechanic since March 2018. He completed a security clearance application, his first, in May 2018. In response to the questions about his financial history, Applicant disclosed three delinquent accounts. The ensuing investigation confirmed and the SOR alleges Applicant owes $25,536 on three delinquent accounts and that he owes another charged-off account for an unspecified amount. Applicant admits that he owes the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and that \u00b6 1.d is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.b. The credit reports in the record tend to support this assertion. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.d is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. (GE 3-5.) Applicant attributes his financial problems to three periods of unemployment between July 2009 and May 2018. These periods of unemployment were not caused by events beyond Applicant\u2019s control. He was unemployed between August 2013 and December 2014 to attend school full time. He was unemployed between August 2016 and November 2016 after deciding to take some time off. He also took two months off before starting his current position in March 2018. Due to the loss of income, Applicant could not afford to meet his financial obligations for the three vehicles he owned. In his answer to the SOR, he claims to have made payment arrangements for the vehicle debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he did not provide any corroborating evidence. While he admits the amounts owed in paragraphs SOR",

He completed a security clearance application, his first, in May 2018. In \nresponse to the questions about his financial history, Applicant disclosed three \ndelinquent accounts. The ensuing investigation confirmed and the SOR alleges \nApplicant owes $25,536 on three delinquent accounts and that he owes another \ncharged-off account for an unspecified amount. Applicant admits that he owes the \naccounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and that \u00b6 1.d is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.b. The \ncredit reports in the record tend to support this assertion. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.d is \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. (GE 3-5.) \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to three periods of unemployment \nbetween July 2009 and May 2018. These periods of unemployment were not caused by \nevents beyond Applicant\u2019s control. He was unemployed between August 2013 and \nDecember 2014 to attend school full time. He was unemployed between August 2016 \nand November 2016 after deciding to take some time off. He also took two months off \nbefore starting his current position in March 2018. Due to the loss of income, Applicant \ncould not afford to meet his financial obligations for the three vehicles he owned. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he claims to have made payment arrangements for the vehicle debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he did not provide any corroborating evidence. While he \nadmits the amounts owed in paragraphs SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.c, he points out that the \ndebts are more than five years old. All of the accounts remain unresolved. (GE 4, 6.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence. \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n3 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $25,000 in unresolved delinquent \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports in the record support the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial \nobligations and an inability to repay his creditors. Financial considerations disqualifying \nconditions 19(a) and (c) apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial concerns raised \nby his delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by events \nbeyond his control. On three occasions, he decided to stop working and could not pay \nhis creditors. He has not established a good-faith effort to repay his creditors, nor has \nhe established that his finances are under control. Accordingly, none of the financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions apply.  \n  \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of production and \npersuasion to refute or mitigate the financial considerations concerns raised in the SOR.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n                                               \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nOn June 10, 2019, in accordance with DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct).1\n Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer) The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2019. \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after September 1, 2006. Since that time, the AG were amended as \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse, and it is now in effect for any adjudications on or \nafter June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 11, 2019, scheduling the hearing for November 21, 2019. I convened the \nhearings as scheduled. \n \nThe Government (GX) submitted four documents marked GE 1-4 and a \ndiscovery letter, which was marked as Hearing Exhibit I. There was no objection to the \ndocuments and they were entered into the record. Applicant did not submit any \ndocuments and testified on his behalf.  \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He graduated from high school, has various \ncertifications, and works as an asbestos worker. He is twice divorced, remarried, and \nhas two children. He has been employed with various companies since approximately \n2016. Applicant completed his latest security clearance application (SCA) on September \n20, 2018. (GX 1) \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from about May 2001 to at least August 2018 (1.a); and that he tested \npositive for marijuana on an employer\u2019s urinalysis test in June 2017 and August 2018 \n(1.b). The SOR further cross alleges under Guideline E the drug use (2.a) and also that \nApplicant falsified his February 26, 2018 SCA when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 14: \nIllegal Drugs in the last year (2.b). Applicant admitted the allegations under 1.a and 1.b, \ndenied 2.a and admitted 2.b. \n \nApplicant testified that to be social he smoked marijuana with his friends. He had \nno idea about its correlation with a security clearance. (Tr. 16) He usually would drink \nand smoke at the same time. He admits smoking at rugby tournaments with his friends \nand at social banquets. (Tr. 18) He stated that if someone offered him a joint he was not \ngoing to say no. However, Applicant stated that it is not a habit. His employer wants to \nsend him abroad to clean asbestos in American embassies and he needs a security \nclearance. His employer advised him to not smoke marijuana. \n \nApplicant began smoking marijuana in 2001, when he came to the United States \nat the age of 21. (Tr. 21) He also noted that he smoked in his home country in 1997.  He \nnoted that it made him high and that he partakes of a joint when it is offered to him.  He \nhas not purchased marijuana or sold it. Applicant acknowledged that his employer has a \ndrug policy. He knows it is illegal to smoke marijuana.  Although, he referred to its \nlegality in some states, as an excuse for thinking it would be okay to smoke. The \ncompany tested Applicant in June 2017 and he failed the drug test. (Tr. 29) Applicant\u2019s \nemployer warned him that he would not get a clearance if he continued to smoke \nmarijuana. (Tr. 32) \n \nApplicant failed a second drug test in August 2018. (GX 4) He stated that he \nprobably had smoked about a month before at a rugby tournament. He was told to take \na drug test because he had hit a car with his large company van in a parking lot and did \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nnot leave a note. (GX 3)  He was given a warning from his employer. Applicant \nexplained that after the second test, he tried to modify his behavior by not going to the \nrugby games or the dinners with his friends. (Tr. 35) He believes that he had smoked \nabout five times from June 17, 2019 until 2018. (Tr.36) Applicant resigned from that job \nin September 2018. (GX 4) He had been given various warnings for security violations.  \n \nApplicant completed a SCA in February 2018. He stated that he has a problem \nwith writing and spelling and reading. (Tr. 40) He admitted that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to \nSection 14: Use of Illegal Drugs. In his answer, he stated that was a mistake and that it \nshould have been a \u201cYes.\u201d At the hearing, he elaborated that he probably read the \nquestion wrong. He noticed all the other drugs listed, such as codeine, hashish, \nnarcotics and the marijuana was not in his head. (Tr. 42) Applicant also stated that he \ntold the investigator during his 2018 interview about the failed drug tests. (Tr. 43) In his \nSeptember 20, 2018 SCA, he indicated that he had used marijuana. (GX 1)  \n \nApplicant was adamant that he no longer smokes marijuana, but he goes out \nwith his friends and does not stay away from marijuana but does not smoke it. (Tr. 47) \nHe then stated that he has not gone to a rugby game or a banquet in a year. He stated \nthat he does not miss smoking marijuana. He has never obtained any drug counseling. \n(Tr. 51) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Such use also raised questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nHere, Applicant admitted he used marijuana with varying frequency from 2001 to \n2018. He failed two drug tests in 2017 and 2018. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(a): \nany substance misuse, and \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug. The \nGovernment\u2019s substantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, thus raises \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns.  \n \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2018. He \nacknowledged using marijuana with varying frequency during the period from 2001 \nthrough 2018. In the life of this Applicant, in terms of age, maturation, and work history, \nsufficient time has not passed to deem his marijuana usage as remote. I find AG \u00b6 26(a) \nand 26(b) (1)-(3) do not apply. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nHere, Applicant intentionally answered \u201cNo\u201d on his February 2019 (SCA) in \nresponse to a question inquiring whether he had illegally used any controlled substance, \nfor example marijuana, in the last year. (Section 14)  He responded \u201cYes on his \nSeptember 2019 SCA. His reasoning was not credible in that he changed his answer. In \ntruth, Applicant had used marijuana on several occasions as early as 1997, and  \nbetween 2001 and 2018.  Consequently, these two disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Potentially \napplicable in this matter is AG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent or it happened under such unique \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, untrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nHere, Applicant exhibited two instances of unreliable conduct reflecting \nquestionable judgment. These include the few instances he used marijuana between \n2001 and 2018. His failure to disclose on his one SCA that he had used marijuana was \nintentional. The responses that he provided were not reasonable and varied each time \nhe responded. He gave various reasons why he answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 14. He stated \nthat he later informed the investigator, but I do not find that plausible, given the plain \nlanguage of the question on the SCAs. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply in \nthis case. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s past drug involvement and \npersonal conduct. He did not follow his employer\u2019s advice to not smoke marijuana so \nthat he could obtains a security clearance. Thus, I have no other evidence to consider. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old asbestos worker. He is married and has two children. \nHe loves his job and wants to work abroad. However, he still associates with the friends \nwho smoke marijuana. He seemed very casual about the use and the reason for the \nsecurity clearance. His use was from 2001 to 2018 with varying frequency. He stated \nthat he does not smoke anymore. \n \nHowever, he intentionally falsified an SCA regarding his use of marijuana. The \nreasons he gave are not plausible. I have doubts as to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \njudgment, and reliability. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nUnder these circumstances, I find Applicant has not mitigated drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and has not mitigated the personal conduct security concerns due to \nintentional falsification of his 2018 SCA. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nNoreen A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.j, which he denied. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at his present job in May 2016. He is a senior consultant. He deployed as a contractor to Afghanistan on two six month rotations in 2009-2010. He has a high school diploma.

The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 20, 2019, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on September 10, 2019, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on September 26, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-5 and 7-9 \n(GE 6 was withdrawn as an exhibit because it did not pertain to Applicant), which were \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was identified as \nhearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified but did not offer any exhibits at hearing. The \nrecord remained open until October 25, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit documentary \nevidence. He submitted AE A-D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 7, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.j, \nwhich he denied. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in May 2016. He is a senior consultant. He deployed as a contractor \nto Afghanistan on two six month rotations in 2009-2010. He has a high school diploma. \nHe married in 2013, has two children from his marriage, and two step-children. (Tr. 6, \n18-19; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged a dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2018, a delinquent state \ntax debt of $739 for tax year 2013, a judgment in the amount of $3,171 filed in March \n2016, and seven charged-off or past-due debts (credit cards and consumer debts) \ntotaling approximately $46,411. The debts are established by credit reports from \nOctober 2016, January 2019, and September 2019; Applicant\u2019s answers to \ninterrogatories; a court record; a state tax record; and his SOR admissions. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n\u2013 1.j). (AE 2, 4-5, 7-9) \n \n \nApplicant explained that his financial distress began when he decided to change \njobs and move to a different state in 2014. The job he took paid about $40,000 less than \nthe job he left. Applicant also admitted that he borrowed approximately $47,000 in \npersonal loans to pay for his wedding in 2013. He defaulted on those loans after about \nsix months, which were then charged off by the lender, and Applicant received an IRS \nForm 1099-C, cancellation of debt designation. Applicant claimed that he included these \ncancelled debts on his 2018 federal tax return and paid the associated tax. He did not \nprovide documentation of his tax return to corroborate this assertion. (Note: the three \ncancelled debts were not alleged in the SOR and I will not use them for disqualification \npurposes. I may use this evidence as it relates to the applicability of any mitigating \nconditions and consideration of the whole-person factors). (Tr. 19-20, 34, 38-39, 41-43; \nGE 2) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he terminated the Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in January \n2018 after talking with family members and deciding that was not his best solution. In \nMarch 2019, a month before the issuance of his SOR, Applicant entered into a payment \nplan (Plan) with a debt relief company (DRC). Under the terms of the Plan, Applicant is \nto pay $693 monthly (through bi-monthly withdrawals from his bank account) and the \nDRC will negotiate settlements with the creditors included in the plan. Documentation \nshows that six creditors are in the Plan, including five listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i). One non-SOR creditor is also in the Plan. Applicant provided \n\n \n3 \n \ndocumentation showing that he made his monthly payments to the DRC for August and \nSeptember 2019. Although a \u201cDedicated Account Agreement\u201d under the Plan is \ndocumented, which shows Applicant\u2019s authorization to debit his bank account for \npayment in March 2019, there is no documentation of any payments to the DRC from \nMarch through July 2019. (Tr. 24-25; GE 2; AE A, C)  \n \n \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \n \n \nState tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant provided documentation from the state \ntaxing authority showing that he has a zero balance related to his personal state income \ntax account as of September 2019. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 27; AE D) \n \n \nJudgment (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant testified that this judgment was included in the \nPlan. His documentation does not support this assertion. There is no other evidence \nshowing payment of this judgment. (Tr. 28; GE 2, 4; AE A) \n \n \nCredit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Documentation supports that this debt is included \nin the Plan, a settlement in the amount of approximately $14,000 was reached with the \ncreditor, and two payments of $631 were made towards the settlement amount in \nSeptember 2019. (Tr. 28; GE 2; AE A, C) \n \n \nCredit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Documentation supports that this debt is included \nin the Plan. No settlement has been reached and no payments have been made to this \ncreditor. (Tr. 28; GE 2; AE A, C) \n \n \nCredit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Documentation supports that Applicant entered \ninto a separate payment plan with this creditor. Applicant stated that this creditor was \nunwilling to enter into a formal written settlement agreement, but agreed to take monthly \npayments from him. Applicant made his first payment of $200 in October 2019. (Tr. 28-\n29; AE B) \n \n \nCredit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Documentation supports that this debt is included \nin the Plan. No settlement has been reached and no payments have been made to this \ncreditor. (Tr. 29; GE 2; AE A, C) \n \n \nCredit card debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i). Documentation supports that these \ndebts are included in the Plan. No settlement has been reached and no payments have \nbeen made to this creditor. (Tr. 30; GE 2; AE A, C) \n \n \nCredit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant denied this debt in his answer to the \nSOR, but he testified that this debt was included in the Plan. His documentation does \nnot support this assertion. There is no other evidence showing payment of this debt. (Tr. \n30; GE 2; AE A, C) \n \n \nApplicant produced a budget as part of his application to the DRC. His monthly \nresidual after all expenses (including his monthly payment under the Plan, but it is \nunclear if the separate settlement payment of $200 monthly is included) is $2. A \n\n \n4 \n \nseparate personal financial statement prepared in March 2019 shows his residual after \nall expenses and payments (including Plan payments) as $159. Other than hiring the \nDRC, Applicant has not received any financial counseling. (Tr. 37; GE 2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was dismissed, owed a state tax \ndebt, and had other delinquent debts, which remain unpaid or unresolved. I find all the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n6 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and, although he resolved his state tax debt and has \nentered into two payment plans, he has not resolved his remaining debts. He failed to \nproduce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. This is \nof particular concern because Applicant\u2019s residual income after all his current financial \nobligations are paid is such a small amount. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to take a lower paying job and to expend approximately \n$40,000 on his wedding were not circumstances beyond his control. Moreover, he did \nnot act responsibly by waiting so long to contract with the DRC and engage his other \ncreditors in an attempt to settle his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable.  \n \n \n \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. Applicant paid his \nstate tax debt and his Chapter 13 bankruptcy was voluntarily dismissed. Even though \nhe entered into two payment plans, both of those plans are in their infancy and it is \nuncertain whether Applicant will continue to make his required payments. His track \nrecord to date does not support his ability to do so. Additionally, he failed to put forth a \ngood-faith effort by waiting so long to address his debts. Given the unpaid status of the \nremaining consumer debt, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) does not apply. AG 20(d) has some application. Applicant resolved SOR \u00b6 1.a and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to that debt. Applicant resolved SOR \u00b6 1.b and AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to \nthat debt. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, including his two \ndeployments, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also \nconsidered that he has made insufficient and untimely efforts to resolve his debts. He \nhas not established a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to \nquestion his ability to resolve his debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.)   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a, 1.b, 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.c, 1.e \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

I have been working with [the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] as my exhibits \nshow.\u201d (Tr. 20) \n \nApplicant did not file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 to \npresent. (Tr. 20-22, 37) However, he suggested he may have filed a tax return for one of \nthose tax years over the 2012 to 2018 period. (Tr. 37) He did not know which tax year   \nhe may have filed a tax return. (Tr. 37) He lacked the documentation for some years to \nfile his tax returns. (Tr. 22) He did not know how much he owed the IRS. (Tr. 23) \n \nThe IRS notified Applicant that he had tax debts for tax years 2012 and 2016. (Tr. \n33-34) On October 3, 2018, Applicant paid the U.S. Treasury $1,151 for tax year 2012. \n(AE B at 2) On June 11, 2019, Applicant paid the U.S. Treasury $3,400 for tax year 2016. \n(AE B at 1) He is waiting for the IRS to send him tax bills for other tax years. (Tr. 34) \nWhen the IRS files substitute tax returns for him and sends him a tax bill, he pays the \nIRS. (Tr. 38) He has not received any bills from the state for delinquent taxes. (Tr. 38) \nApplicant did not indicate whether the IRS provides IRS-generated substitute tax return \ninformation to state tax authorities.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h allege Applicant has six medical debts placed \nfor collection for $65,566, $645, $540, $450, $292, and $60. Applicant had two heart \nattacks, and he received surgery. (Tr. 23-24) He said he paid about $5,000 to $8,000 over \nthe previous six years to address the medical debts. (Tr. 26) He did not provide \ndocumentation such as receipts showing any payments of medical debts. In the past two \nyears he has paid about $6,000 for prescription medications. (AE A) \n \nIn 2019, Applicant had a suspected heart attack; however, it turned out not to be \na heart attack. (Tr. 25) He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter. (Tr. 23-25) \nOn October 25, 2019, a medical creditor wrote Applicant and offered to accept monthly \npayments of $453 beginning when the agreement is signed. (AE A) According to the \nagreement, the payments were supposed to be made until the $13,587 debt was paid in \nfull. (AE A) The agreement was not signed and dated. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s insurance did \nnot pay for the helicopter transportation to the hospital because the insurance company \ndecided it was not medically necessary, and/or he lacked prior approval. (Tr. 25) Applicant \nsaid he was disputing his responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 25) He said he was willing to \nstart making a $300 monthly payments. (Tr. 40) \n \nSince 2017, Applicant went to Jamaica about seven times for five to seven days \nfor each trip. (Tr. 35) In 2019, Applicant went to Jamaica for six or seven days for a \nvacation. (Tr. 34) He also traveled to Costa Rica twice. (Tr. 36) \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant conceded that he has not filed tax returns for several \nyears, and he had a large number of medical debts. (AE A) Nevertheless, his credit score \nis \u201cok.\u201d (AE A) He was able to purchase a used vehicle this year at a reasonable rate and \nsecure a mortgage to buy his home at a low interest rate. (AE A) He worked diligently for \n40 years and made important contributions to national security, and he denied that he is \n\u201cin any way a risk to our national security.\u201d (AE A) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant had serious medical problems which resulted in more than $65,000 in \ndelinquent medical debt. He may have been underemployed after he retired until he was \nre-employed by his company. These are circumstances beyond his control that adversely \naffected his finances. However, these circumstances are insufficiently detailed to prove \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. There are not clear indications his \nfinancial problems are under control.  \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nApplicant did not timely file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years \n2012 to present. He suggested he may have filed a tax return for one of those tax years \nover the 2012 to 2018 period; however, he did not know which year he filed a tax return. \nHe did not know how much he owed the IRS.  \n \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nAfter the IRS generates substitute tax returns and sends him bills, he pays them. The IRS \nnotified Applicant that he had tax debts for tax years 2012 and 2016. On October 3, 2018, \nApplicant paid the U.S. Treasury $1,151 for tax year 2012. On June 11, 2019, Applicant \npaid the U.S. Treasury $3,400 for tax year 2016. He is waiting for the IRS to send him tax \nbills for other tax years. He has not received any bills from the state for delinquent taxes. \nHe did not establish that he was unable to timely file his tax returns.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege he did not timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years in addition to those alleged in the SOR (tax years 2013 and 2016). \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above.  \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \n  \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nto timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has \ncommented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies in part because the IRS filed some substitute tax returns on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf; he has been paying his taxes through withholdings from his pay; and he paid the \nIRS when he was billed. However, the timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important \naspect of the analysis. Even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are filed, the Appeal \nBoard provided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security \nclearance: \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). In ISCR Case \nNo. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the grant of a \nsecurity clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nApplicant has six delinquent medical debts totaling more than $65,000. He said he \nhas been making some payments to address his medical debts; however, he did not \nprovide any corroborating proof of payments, such as receipts, correspondence from \ncreditors, or cancelled checks. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still \nconsidered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline \nF mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to timely file \nhis tax returns. He did not establish he was unable to make greater progress resolving \nhis delinquent medical debts. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old laboratory technician employed by a subcontractor for a \nmajor defense contractor. In 1978, he received an associate\u2019s degree in aerospace \ntechnology. He worked for a defense contractor for 37 years; he was retired in May of \n2015; and he resumed employment with the same employer in February of 2018. \nApplicant is an excellent employee who made substantial contributions to his company \nand the national defense over a lengthy career. There is no evidence of security \nviolations. \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant knew that he needed to timely file his income tax returns. He may \nnot have fully understood or appreciated the importance of this requirement. He \nprocrastinated. He did not establish he was unable to make greater progress resolving \nhis tax issues. His actions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to \nfully mitigate security concerns. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about [his] reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401.

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/30/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConcerns). Applicant defaulted on 13 consumer accounts and has admitted that he owes \nall but three of these debts. The total of the admitted debts is about $28,000. He also filed \ntwo Chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions, one in 2001 and the other in February 2019. All of \nthe admitted debts are included in the bankruptcy proceeding. Applicant provided \ninsufficient evidence in mitigation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 18, 2017, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA) seeking \nto renew a previously granted clearance. On April 12, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG) for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 9, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He admitted 12 of the 15 SOR \nallegations, but failed to provide any documentation regarding mitigating circumstances \nor character evidence.  \n \nOn June 27, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \nin an undated File of Relevant Material (FORM), which included eight attached \ndocuments, identified as Items 1-8. Applicant received the FORM on July 17, 2019. One \nof the documents offered by Department Counsel was Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition, which was filed about two months before the issuance of the SOR in February \n2019 (the 2019 Petition). A copy of the FORM with the attached items was provided to \nApplicant. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit a written \nresponse and documents to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns raised by \nthe SOR allegations. He did not respond to the FORM.  \n \nBy failing to respond to the FORM, Applicant raised no objection to the admission \nof Item 8 attached to the Government\u2019s FORM, which is an unauthenticated report of \ninvestigation summarizing Applicant\u2019s May 21, 2018 background interview. Department \nCounsel advised Applicant in his FORM that Applicant had the right to object to the \nadmissibility of this evidence as unauthenticated and that his failure to do so may \nconstitute a waiver of any objection he may have. He was also advised in the FORM that \nhe could provide corrections or updates to the information summarized in the document. \nBy failing to respond to the FORM, Applicant made no objections or comments about Item \n8. I conclude that he has waived his right to object to the admissibility of this document. I \nhave marked the Items attached to the FORM as Government Exhibit (GE) 1-8. All \ndocuments are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on September \n20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.f and 1.i-1.n in my findings of fact. I have also considered his notation in his SOR \nresponse that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f and 1.i-1.n were included in his 2019 \nPetition. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 3, his SCA, unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s FORM, and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and has married twice and divorced twice. Since 2009, \nhe has lived with his domestic partner. They have one child, age 7. He graduated from \nhigh school in 1995. He has worked full time as a transportation officer for a state \ncorrectional facility since 2006. In 2017, he began working part time as an armed security \nguard for his security clearance sponsor. He is also an employee of an ambulance \ncompany. He has worked with that company for a number of years, but has chosen not \nto work any hours at that job since 2017. He is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance. \n\n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s partner lost her full-time job in 2015. Since then, she has been looking \nfor a full-time job, but has only worked at part-time jobs causing her annual income to be \nreduced from about $33,000 to about $11,000. Applicant claims that this loss of income \nhas caused him to be unable to pay a number of his debts, which are listed in the SOR \nand discussed below. As a result of his financial situation, Applicant filed the 2019 \nPetition. As noted below, the petition seeks the discharge of the debts listed in the SOR \namong other debts. In his petition, he claims that his income is about $2,600 per month \nand his expenses are about $3,100 per month and that the total amount of his unsecured \ndebts is about $47,000. (SOR 1.c) (GE 8 at 1; GE 5 at 12.) \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties. In 2001, he filed a petition for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 7 and successfully discharged his debts. The record does not \ncontain any information regarding the amount of the debts discharged. (SOR 1.b) (GE 4 \nat 3.) \n \n \nApplicant admits the following debts:  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Debt owed to a credit union in the amount of $11,012 on a \ndeficiency following repossession of a motorcycle \u2013 This account was opened in \n2009 when Applicant purchased a motorcycle. He defaulted on the loan in 2012, and the \nmotorcycle was repossessed. Applicant owes a deficiency of $11,012 following the \ncreditor\u2019s resale of the collateral. In his 2019 Petition, he lists the amount of the debt as \n$22,643. He has provided no information regarding the discrepancy. This debt is included \nin the bankruptcy. (GE 5 at 26; GE 7 at 2.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 Debt in the amount of $11,449 owed on a repossessed vehicle \u2013 \nIn 2011, Applicant borrowed $12,162 to buy a 2001 vehicle. He defaulted on the loan in \n2013, and the vehicle was repossessed and eventually resold. He remains responsible \nfor the deficiency in the amount of $11,449 and other charges. In his 2019 Petition, he \nlists the amount of the debt as $6,253, which is the same amount appearing in GE 7, the \nmost recent credit report in the record. This debt is included in the bankruptcy. (GE 5 at \n32; GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 Debt in the amount of $3,465 owed on a second repossessed \nvehicle \u2013 Applicant purchased this 2004 vehicle in 2014. Applicant defaulted on the \nvehicle in early 2015. According to his SCA, he defaulted in October 2016 because \u201ca \nmember of his household,\u201d presumably his partner, lost her job. The debt has been the \nsubject of a garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages. This debt is included in the bankruptcy. \n(GE 3 at 29-30; GE 5 at 25; GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2013 Credit-card account charged off in the amount of $408 \u2013This \naccount was opened in 2014 and he defaulted on the debt in 2015. This debt is included \nin the bankruptcy. (GE 5 at 27; GE 6 at 3; GE 7 at 2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.n \u2013 Six delinquent debts owed on communications and \nmedical accounts. Applicant is indebted on collection accounts originally owed to a \n\n4 \n \ncellphone service provider (SOR \u00b6 1.i for $722) and to two TV entertainment providers \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j for $431 and 1.l for $202) and on three medical collection accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.k, 1.m and 1.n for $234, $$95, and $47, respectively). In his SOR response, he wrote \nthat all six debts were included in his 2019 bankruptcy petition. Four of the six accounts \nare listed in the 2019 Petition. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.l for TV \nentertainment accounts are not readily apparent on the list of unsecured creditors in the \n2019 Petition, but are likely listed under the names of different collection agencies or \nconsolidated with other debts. (GE 5 at 27, 28, 33; SOR response at 2.)  \n \n \nApplicant denies and disputes the following debts in his SOR response: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.o \u2013 Disputed debts \u2013 Applicant disputes three alleged \ndebts in his SOR response. He claims he paid in or about August 2015 the debt for $365 \nhe owed to a bank, which is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.g. He writes that he is paying off the \ndebt of $771 owed to a furniture store, which is alleged in SOR \u00b61.h, and that the balance \nas of the date of his May 2019 SOR response was $107. He also asserts that he has a \npayment arrangement to pay the debt of $312 owed for personal property taxes, which is \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o, to pay $25 per month and as of May 2019, he only owed about $75. \nHe provided no documentation to support his claims. (SOR response; GE 2 a 2; GE 8 at \n4.) \n \n \nAside from his 2019 Petition, Applicant offered no evidence regarding his debts. \nHis employment at two jobs to pay his living expenses provides some evidence of his \ncharacter. By failing to respond to the FORM, he has provided no bankruptcy records or \nother evidence updating the status of his case. His petition states that he received credit \ncounseling from an approved credit counselling agency within six months of the filing of \nthe petition. (GE 5 at 9.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n6 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s behavior is current and frequent and did \nnot occur under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, as evidenced by his 2001 \nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts. His financial condition casts doubts on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established to the limited extent that some of Applicant\u2019s \ndebts became delinquent in 2015 or later, after his partner lost her full-time employment. \nOn the other hand, his two largest debts became delinquent before 2015, specifically the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. Applicant has offered no evidence, however, that \nhe has acted responsibly in addressing his many debts. He lost three vehicles in \nrepossessions and his only response to his indebtedness on the resulting deficiencies is \nto file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition seeking to discharge the debts. The same is true \nfor his other debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. The 2019 Petition introduced by the \nGovernment reflects that Applicant received credit counseling in connection with his \npreparation for filing his 2019 Petition. By failing to respond to the FORM, Applicant made \nno attempt to show that this counseling has helped him in any way and that he has \norganized his finances to better control them in the future to avoid the problems of \ndelinquent debts that caused him to file the 2019 Petition. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s possible discharge of his debts in a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors or a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. Moreover, the record evidence simply \nshows that he has filed a bankruptcy petition. There is no evidence that the bankruptcy \ncourt has approved a discharge and that Applicant\u2019s debts have in fact been discharged. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. The three debts that Applicant disputes in his SOR \nresponse are small and are unrelated to the cause of his financial problem. Moreover, he \ndoes not dispute the legitimacy of the debts, he merely claims that he paid one debt \nalleged in the SOR and is in the process of paying the other two, notwithstanding that he \nfiled the 2019 Petition three months before his SOR response. He failed to provide any \ndocumentation in support of his claims.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are (1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n8 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on or after September 1, 2006. Since that time, the AG were amended as \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse, and it is now in effect for any \nadjudication on or after June 8, 2017.  Applicant timely answered the SOR and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on May 20, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on May 28, 2019. Applicant did \nnot object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided no response to the FORM. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM and identified as Items 1 through 3, \nis admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on July 12, 2019. Based on \nmy review of the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns under drug involvement and substance abuse. \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. He graduated from high school in 2010 and obtained \nhis undergraduate degree in 2016. He is single and has no children. He has been \nemployed as a developmental operations engineer with his current employer since \n2016. Applicant was granted a security clearance by DOD in 2016. (Item 2)  Applicant \ncompleted his security clearance application (SCA) in April 2017. He reports no military \nservice.   \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used mushrooms in about February 2017, while \ngranted access to classified information. (SOR 1.a) It also alleges that Applicant used \nmarijuana, with varying frequency, from about September 2012 to about April 2014. \n(SOR 1.b) (Item 1) Applicant admitted both allegations under guideline H, drug \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant disclosed the information about his marijuana use on his 2017 SCA. He \nsmoked in college in a social setting with friends. He believed it was about four to six \ntimes, separated by months apart.  (Item 2) In that SCA, he noted that he no longer had \nany interest in marijuana, it was experimental, and he is focused on his career. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he stated that he used the mushrooms because the \nsupplier of the substance gave it to him. Applicant stated that it was in a \u201csafe setting.\u201d \nHe stated that he ingested between two and three grams of the substance. He believes \nthat this did not affect his ability to guard classified information. He further explained that \nhe was depressed at the time due to his grandfather\u2019s death a month earlier. He stated \nthat he was having difficulty grieving. He noted that he made a poor choice that he \notherwise would not have made. He explained it was a one-time event and he \nunderstood the repercussions after the incident. (Item 1, attachment) \n \nApplicant noted that he occasionally sees the supplier of the mushrooms \nbecause he is part of his group of friends. However, he would refuse any future \ninvitations to use any illegal substance. He has never tested positive for any illegal \nsubstance and he avoids environments where an illegal drug might be used to the best \nof his ability. \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 2018 OPM interview, he disclosed the information about the \nuse of marijuana. He noted that \u201cpot\u201d was regularly available during parties. He \nreiterated that he had no future intent to use marijuana. (Item 3) \n \nAs to the use of mushrooms, Applicant again noted that he was with a friend who \noffered it to him.  He claims he used it because he was in a low place and it was a poor \nchoice. (Item 3) Applicant stated that it had no effect on his work or relationships and \nthat he did report the use.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nApplicant stated that he intends to continue to abstain from all substance misuse. \nHe has no police record concerning the use of illegal drugs. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Such use also raised questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nHere, Applicant admitted he used marijuana on a few occasions between 2012 \nand 2014. He acknowledged that he used mushrooms in 2017 when he held a security \nclearance. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse, and \u00b6 25(f): any \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition. The Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, thus raises security concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden \nshifts to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place nearly five \nyears ago. He reported using marijuana a few times during the period from 2012 \nthrough 2014. In the life of this Applicant, in terms of age, maturation, and work history, \nsufficient time has passed to deem his marijuana usage as not being recent. Between \n2012 and 2014, he used marijuana a few times, reflecting that his usage was infrequent. \nAlthough in 2017, he chose to use mushrooms in spite of holding a security clearance. \nHis justification for the use was the passing of his grandfather and his deep depression \nand emotional state. However, he knew he was using an illegal substance.  Applicant \nbetrayed the Government\u2019s trust in him when he ingested mushrooms in 2017. The fact \nthat he was depressed is not justification for the use. Granted, he disclosed the incident, \nand also noted that it was only a one time incident, but he still sees the friend who gave \nthe illegal substance to him. Applicant claimed that he has no intention of returning to \ndrugs, or jeopardizing his career. I find AG \u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(1)-(3) do not apply. \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nHere, Applicant exhibited instances of unreliable conduct reflecting questionable \njudgment. These include the few instances he used marijuana between 2012 and 2014, \nand which included his singular use of mushrooms in 2017, after being granted a \nsecurity clearance. Spread out over a dozen years, his use of marijuana was mainly in \nhis college years. His drug use in academia could have been be readily dismissed due \nto youthful indiscretion. This is particularly true given its infrequency. His use of \nmushrooms in 2017, on the other hand, shows that he violated and ignored rules and \nlaws concerning illegal drugs. He was an adult entrusted with the security clearance. \nHis justification for using the illegal substance in 2017 does not mitigate the security \nconcerns. I have doubts about his reliability and good judgment. I find none of the \nmitigating conditions apply in this case. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s past drug involvement and \npersonal conduct. He did not respond to the FORM to supplement the record. Thus, I \nhave no other evidence to consider. \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old engineer who was granted a security clearance in \n2016. He is single and has no children.  \n \nApplicant tried marijuana in college, a varied number of times. His last use was in \n2014 and he intends never to use an illegal drugs again. His maintains that his focus is \non his career. \n \nHowever, in 2017, Applicant ingested mushrooms given to him by a friend. He \nstill occasionally sees that friend. The justification for using in 2017 was depression. \nHowever, he held a security clearance. He is aware of the laws about the illegal use of \ndrugs. I have doubts as to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. Under these circumstances, I find \nApplicant has not mitigated drug involvement and substance misuse. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n12/17/2019 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 14, 2019. \nOn June 14, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 7, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On October 2, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 7. She was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on \nOctober 16, 2019, and timely submitted her response on or about October 25, 2019, to \n\n \n2 \n \nwhich the Government did not object. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. I \nadmitted Items 3 through 7 into evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer and FORM \nresponse included several documents that I admitted into evidence as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through D. The case was assigned to me on November 5, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), her \nJanuary 2019 SCA (Item 3), and summaries of security clearance interviews conducted \nbetween December 2017 and February 2018 (SI) (Item 5).1 Item 5 was not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant \nwaived any objection to Item 5. The Government included in the FORM a notice \nadvising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of Item 5 on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if she did not raise any objection \nto Item 5 in her response to the FORM, or if she did not respond to the FORM, she \ncould be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 5 could be \nconsidered as evidence in her case. Applicant received the FORM, including a copy of \nItem 5, but neither responded to the FORM nor otherwise objected to Item 5. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 34, is unmarried with one minor child. She earned her high school \ndiploma in 2003. She has been employed by a defense contractor since April 2019. She \nwas previously granted security clearances; by the DOD in 2010, and by an unspecified \nagency in 2018. \n \nBetween 2011 and 2018, Applicant incurred the 11 delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR, which totaled $43,417. In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all but one \n$515 medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.k), of which she claimed to have no knowledge. That \ndebt was not only confirmed by a 2017 credit report, but she previously acknowledged it \nas a hospital bill incurred in 2010 when she did not have the funds to pay it. (Items 4, 6; \nItem 5 at 7) \n \nApplicant attributed her debts primarily to extended periods of unemployment \nincluding: 1) June 2018 through April 2019; 2) September 2014 through June 2015; and \n3) February 2010 through June 2011. She also extended her credit on behalf of persons \nwho did not pay the creditors as they had agreed, which resulted in the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. (Items 2, 3, 5) \n \nApplicant asserted that she made monthly payments of $200 toward resolving \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, beginning on a date not specified in the record until she \nbecame unemployed in June 2018. However, she did not provide any corroborating \n                                                          \n1 The record evidence suggests that Applicant completed another SCA prior to the one generated in \nJanuary 2019. However, the earlier SCA was not included in the record. The SOR is based on concerns \nraised by the January 2019 SCA. Thus, the earlier SCA not being included in the record did not affect \neither the relative positions of the parties or my decision. Nevertheless, I mention it to avoid any confusion \nin the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nevidence. Her credit reports reflected a reduction of merely $98 in the balance owed \nbetween March 2017 and January 2019. (Item 3 at 50; Item 4 at 4; Item 6 at 4) \n \nIn June 2019, Applicant engaged the services of a company to assist her with \n\u201cgetting some derogatory/frivolous items removed from her credit file.\u201d Those services \ncost her $88 per month. However, the record does not specify how much, if any, of that \nmonthly fee is being used to repay her creditors. Nor did Applicant specify whether she \nreceived financial counseling, either from the company or otherwise. (Item 2; AE A, C) \n \nAfter an investigation by one of the credit bureau agencies in August 2019, the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and SOR \u00b6 1.j were removed from Applicant\u2019s credit report. \nConversely, the agency affirmed the validity of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. \nApplicant proffered no bases for disputing of any of these four debts. (AE C at 3, 4) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was a loan for a car originally owned by Applicant. \nShe gave the car to a friend who agreed to assume responsibility for repaying the loan. \nWhen the friend could no longer afford the loan payments, the car was repossessed. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j was the final bill generated when Applicant cancelled her \ncable service. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was a loan for a car Applicant owned. The \ncar was repossessed after she defaulted on the loan due to unemployment. Without \nproviding any corroborating evidence, she asserted that any balance owed on the loan \nwas resolved after the creditor resold the car. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was a car \nloan that she cosigned for another individual. When that individual defaulted on the \nloan, the car was repossessed. (AE C at 3; Item 2 at 1-2; Item 5 at 6, 8; Item 3 at 46-47, \n50-51) \n \nIn June 2019, Applicant paid $186 towards the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. As of \nAugust 2019, the remaining balance was $437. In September 2019, she arranged to \nresume monthly payments of $100 to resolve the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. She did \nnot, however, provide evidence that any payments were actually made. Since about \nAugust 2019, she has been making bi-monthly payments via an involuntary wage \ngarnishment (20% of her paycheck) to satisfy a June 2018 judgment granted in favor of \nthe creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. As of September 2019, she owed a remaining \nbalance of $922. (AE B, C, D; GE 7; Item 2 at 4) \n \nThe record did not specify Applicant\u2019s relevant income and expense prior to \nAugust 2019.  In August 2019, she reported a monthly net remainder of $1,295. \nHowever, that number did not include unspecified expenses for her \u201cdaughter\u2019s needs,\u201d \nwhich she asserted renders her salary insufficient to address her debts. Recognizing \nthe security concern raised by her debts, she began seeking part-time employment. Her \npart-time job search efforts had been unsuccessful as of October 2019. (Item 2 at 3-4; \nFORM response) \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt resolution plan includes making unspecified payments on the \n22nd day of each month to the creditors of her admitted debts, one by one, until they \nare fully resolved. Her plan requires her to maintain her full-time employment and to \nsupplement her income with a part-time job. She believes this approach is the best way \n\n \n4 \n \nto ensure that she remains able to meet her ongoing living expenses. The plan is on \nhold, in part, because of the garnishment and, in part, because her creditors have asked \nfor good-faith deposits in amounts larger than she can afford. Once the garnishment is \nsatisfied, she will work on amassing the requested deposits. She anticipated that the \ngarnishment would be completed by about mid-November 2019. (Item 2 at 3-4; FORM \nresponse) \n \nAt the close of her FORM response, Applicant stated the following: \n \nI can say that I made some very poor judgments with my credit, and have \nlearned my lesson from helping people when it comes to my credit. I was \nyoung, moved away from home, and did not think about how me not \npaying things on time or at all would affect me in the long run. I also \nunderstand now that I am older how important my credit is, in life and also \nhow important it is to maintain and keep my clearance and my occupation. \nI am trying my best to fix my credit . . . I can\u2019t take care of my debt \novernight. [sic] \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debts totaling $43,417 establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are fully established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nI credit Applicant with her one-time payment towards satisfaction of the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. The fact that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is being resolved via \ninvoluntary garnishments after a judgment does not exemplify a \u201cgood-faith effort.\u201d \nBecause she did not provide sufficient proof, I am unable to conclude that she made the \npurported payments for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.  \n \nThe company Applicant engaged to assist in repairing her credit has not helped \nher settle any debts. The fact that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.j were \nremoved from her credit report does not absolve her from repaying them given that she \nhad no basis to dispute them. She similarly failed to proffer any such basis as to the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. While Applicant asserted a reasonable basis as to the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a, she failed to provide any documented proof to substantiate it. Moreover, \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c were reported as valid debts on her August \n2019 credit report. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant credibly proclaimed an evolved understanding about the importance of \nmaintaining good credit and improving her financial stability. However, substantial debts \nremain unresolved and she failed to demonstrate that she acted responsibly to address \nthem. She has not received any financial counseling, nor demonstrated that she has \ncontrol of her finances. Applicant is on the right track by developing a repayment plan, \nbut there is no evidence that she is able to follow through with the plan or that her \nindebtedness is not likely to recur. She has not fully resolved any of the SOR debts, nor \nhas she established a meaningful track record of voluntary payments to her creditors. \nThus, in light of the record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the \nGuideline F concerns at this time.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by her indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications \nfacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons under the drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct guidelines why DoD adjudicators could not make the \naffirmative determination of eligibility for a security clearance, and recommended referral \nto an administrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended. DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and Security Executive \nAgent, Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) \n(SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n                               \n                                                                                          \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 5, 2019, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 9, 2019, and scheduled for hearing on August 28, \n2019. A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering whether \nit would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of two \nexhibits (GEs 1-2). Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and five exhibits. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection as GEs 1-2. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere admitted without objection as AEs A-E.  The transcript was received on October 21, \n2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used marijuana with varying frequency \nbetween January 2013 and January 2018 and (b) used Adderall not prescribed to him \nbetween March 2018 and August 2018. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covering his \ndrug activities with explanations. He claimed his use was infrequent (once a month or \nless) and recreational with friends and family. He claimed he has ceased using \nmarijuana and has informed his friends and family of his decision. He also claimed that \nhe disposed of all drug paraphernalia. Addressing his non-prescribed Adderall usage, he \nclaimed his use was experimental (less than five times), and he has since stopped using \nthe drug. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor. He seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never married and has no children. (GE 1) He earned a high school \ndiploma in September 2013. He attended classes at an accredited university between \nSeptember 2013 and June 2018 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nengineering in June 2018. (GEs 1-2) He reported no military service. \nBetween June 2016 and June 2018, Applicant worked for a defense contractor as a \npart-time summer intern. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 25-26) Since June 2018, he has been employed \nas a full-time software engineer with special concentration in projects for future \nsimulations, as well as projects that address radio signal systems. (GE 2 and AE B; Tr. \n19) Previously (June 2014-December 2014), he worked for two employers as a resident \nadvisor and summer intern, respectively. (AE B) As a resident advisor, he developed, \nmaintained, and coordinated social living conditions for his university. And, while a \nsummer intern for a local utility firm, he tested his firm\u2019s satellite web page. (AE B) \nApplicant was denied an interim security clearance in 2016 while he was a summer \nintern, with no reasons given.

Altogether, he used marijuana about 20 times during this period.  (GE \n2) Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Federal \nControlled Substance Act, and as such, its manufacture, use, possession, and \ndistribution is federally regulated. In the electronic questionnaires for investigations \nprocessing (e-QIP), Applicant completed in November 2016, he admitted his use of \nmarijuana in social situations \u201cless than a dozen times\u201d between January 2013 and \nAugust 2016. (GE 1) \nIn a follow-up personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator of the Office of \nPersonnel management (OPM in August 2018, Applicant increased his estimated \nmarijuana use \u201cto a total of approximately 20 times\u201d from his first use in January 2013 to \nhis last use in August 2018. (GE 2) And, when asked in a subsequent PSI convened in \nDecember 2018 to update his first and last use of marijuana and other drugs between \nJanuary 2013 and December 2018, he confirmed his recreational use of marijuana with \nhis mother in August 2018. (GE 2 and AE E; Tr. 20, 26-27) Asked to respond to \ninterrogatories propounded by the government in April 2019, he expanded his use of \nmarijuana with his mother to include additional use in November 2018. (GE 2) Accepted \nare his assurances that he has not used marijuana since his last admitted use of the \nsubstance in November 2018 (a period of less that nine months). \nWhile Applicant has provided prior assurances that he will not use marijuana or any \nother illegal drugs in the future, his intentions are tempered by his recurrent use of \nmarijuana in 2018 with full notice of the anti-drug policies in effect by the DoD and his \nemployer. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 27, 30) Before accepting his internship with his employer in \n2016, he was explicitly notified of the DoD\u2019s anti-drug policy. (Tr. 25-26) \nNotice of the DoD\u2019s anti-drug policy was further impressed upon Applicant by the \nquestions asked of him about drug use in the e-QIP he completed in 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 25-\n27) With this imputed notice, he told the OPM investigator in his December 2018 PSI \ninterview that he had no intent to use marijuana in the future. (GE 2) Believing that \nmarijuana is legal under his state\u2019s controlling law, he twice resumed his use of \nmarijuana with his mother in November 2018 and continues to socialize with his mother \nand other persons who use marijuana, albeit out of his presence.  (GE 2; Tr. 26, 30-31) \nIn his updated PSI interview of December 2018, Applicant was asked if he had ever \nmisused non-prescribed medications. (GE 2) After initially answering no to the question, \nhe was confronted with his misuse of prescription drugs. (GE 2) Once confronted by the \nOPM investigator, Applicant admitted to using Adderall not prescribed to him twice with \nfriends for recreation purposes in August 2018. In his answers to interrogatories \npropounded by the government in April 2019, he expanded his use of Adderall not \nprescribed to him to include his use of Adderall not prescribed to him in November 2018. \nAccepted are his assurances that he has not used marijuana or Adderall not prescribed \nto him since his last admitted use of Adderall in November 2018. More recently in his \nhearing testimony, Applicant increased his recollected use of non-prescribed Adderall to \nfive occasions in 2018.

(GE 2 and AE D) \nEndorsements \nApplicant is well-regarded by his manager, former classmates, family. (AEs C and \nE) Former classmates who have remained good friends describe him as honest, highly \nresponsible, trustworthy, reliable, and hard-working. (AE E) They recount the many \ninstances where he has prioritized helping his classmates over resting. (AE E) \nApplicant\u2019s former classmates who have known him for many years ((one of whom is in a \ncurrent romantic relationship with him) credit him with doing so much for his friends and \nfamily while being a role model for those around him. (AEs A and E) Acknowledging their \nawareness of his clearance situation, they believe his past mistakes are more \ncompensated by his contributions to his work, friends, and family. (AEs A and E) \nNonetheless, because his mother shared marijuana with him on at least two occasions in \n2018, it is unclear at this point what positive influence she may choose to impose  on him \nin his future efforts to sustain his committed abstinence. \nApplicant received solid performance evaluations for calendar year 2018. (AE C) \nHe received excellent ratings in each of the rated categories: knowledge, skills and \nability; problem solving, discretion/latitude, and interrelationships with staff and \ncustomers. He is credited by his manager with being an overall excellent performer who \nhas demonstrated strong leadership with personal integrity in his company relationships \nand in his conforming to company standards. (AE C) \nPolicies \nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of \nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place \nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the \ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and \nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent \nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed \nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be \nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be \nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 531 (1988).  And because all security clearances must be clearly consistent with the \nnational interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy \nconcerns are pertinent herein:\n  Drug Involvement \nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24.\n   Burden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all \nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a \nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or \nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not \nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually \nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted \nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. \nBased on the requirement of \nExec. Or. 10865 that all security \nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the \nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  And because all security clearances must be \nclearly consistent with the national interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with \nthe Applicant. \nAnalysis \nApplicant is a well-regarded software developer who presents with a \nconsiderable history of drug involvement. Principal security issues in this case center \non his use of marijuana in various frequency over a five-year period (2013-2018) and \nmore recent use of non-prescribed Adderall on at least two occasions in 2018. \nDrug concerns \nOver a five-year period between January 2013 and November 2018, Applicant \nused marijuana in varying frequencies in social settings with friends and his mother. \nSome of his marijuana use occurred during periods of part-time employment in \nviolation of his employers\u2019 anti-drug policies. And, on at least two occasions in 2018, he \nused non-prescribed Adderall. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to using illegal drugs raise security concerns over risks of \nrecurrence as well as  judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence presented, two \ndisqualifying conditions of the AGs for drug abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \ndrug abuse,\u201d and DC \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s recurrent use of marijuana over a five -year period and recent use of \nnon-prescribed Adderall raises questions over the strength of his abstinence \ncommitment. To be sure, Applicant has made noticeable gains in his efforts to mitigate \nhispast drug activities. Still, his multiple drug activities covered a considerable period \n(over five years), and have not been accompanied by any cognizable counseling or \nprogrammatic rehabilitation. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s varying use of marijuana over a considerable period of \ntime, with less than nine months of sustained abstinence, compounded by his recent \nuse of Adderall not prescribed to him, none of the mitigating conditions for \ndruginvolvement are available. While his signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement is encouraging, he has made similar assurances before only to return \nto the illegal use of marijuana and Adderall not prescribed to him in 2018. \n6 \n\n       Given Applicant\u2019s recurrence history, his assurances alone without evidence of \nmore sustained abstinence are not enough to warrant any mitigation credit from, MC \u00b6 \n26(b)(3), or any of the other mitigating conditions potentially available under Guideline \nH. Without more time to establish a pattern of sustained abstinence from the use of \nillegal drugs and non-prescribed controlled substances, none of the other mitigating \nconditions covered by the drug involvement guideline are available to Applicant. Put \ndifferently, with less than nine months of demonstrated abstinence from illegal and \nnon-prescribed controlled substances drugs, raised security concerns over Applicant\u2019s \npast illegal drugs are not mitigated. \n From a whole-person perspective, Applicant has established independent \nprobative evidence of his overall honesty, trustworthiness, and understanding of DoD \npolicy constraints on the use of illegal substances. He lacks enough positive \nreinforcements, however, to facilitate safe predictions he is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole, at this time there is insufficient probative evidence \nof sustainable mitigation to make predictable judgments about his  ability to avoid drugs \nand related activities in the foreseeable future. Taking into account all of the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug activities over a five-year period, raised \nsecurity concerns with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a and \n1.b of the SOR are not mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n     \n      \n     \n \n                                  \nWhole-person assessment \nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s continuing drug \nactivities while employed by a current employer with known anti-drug policies, his \nexplanations, and whole-person considerations, his disclosures are insufficient to \nenable him to convincingly mitigate illegal drug involvement concerns associated with \nhis past use of illegal drugs and Adderall not prescribed to him. Overall, Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations of his past drug use are not persuasive enough to warrant conclusions \nthat his judgment lapses associated with his past use of illegal drugs and non-\nprescribed drugs are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, \nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate \nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. \nGUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):     \n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparas. 1.a and 1.b:\n   Against Applicant \nConclusion\n In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is denied. \nRoger C.

Driskill, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n12/09/2019 \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant illegally used drugs between 2012 and September 2018. He used \nmarijuana after stating in his 2017 security clearance application (SCA) that he would \nforego any future use of illegal drugs. There is no evidence of substance misuse after \nSeptember 2018. Nevertheless, the passage of time so far is insufficient to demonstrate \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, ability to comply with the law, and his ability to protect \nclassified information. Drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Clearance denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his first SCA on June 8, 2017. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator on September 17, 2018, and answered a set of interrogatories \nfrom the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on April 26, 2019. After \nreviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse) on May 17, \n2019. Applicant answered the SOR on June 10, 2019, and requested a decision based \non the record in lieu of a hearing. \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), submitting the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nJuly 30, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on August 5, 2019. He was allowed 30 \ndays to submit any objections to the FORM and to provide material to refute, extenuate, \nand mitigate the concerns. The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2019. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM and waived any objections. I admitted the \nFORM\u2019s proffered evidence and considered it (FORM Items 2 and 3).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted that he illegally used marijuana between 2012 and September \n2018. (SOR paragraph 1.a) He denied that he intends to continue to use marijuana in \nthe future. His admission is incorporated as a findings of fact. After a thorough review of \nthe record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He has never married, and has no children. He has been \nworking for his employer and clearance sponsor since he was hired in June 2017.  \n \nOn June 8, 2017, Applicant submitted his first SCA. In his responses to Question \n23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he \nillegally purchased and used marijuana for himself and friends between December 2012 \nand March 2015. He explained that he used marijuana casually and typically socially. \nHe described his use of marijuana as follows: \n \nUsually about once a month during this period, never more than twice a \nweek. Didn\u2019t begin using with any real regularity until May-June of 2013. \nRoughly around 50 times total. Typically in social situations, though \naround the time October to November of 2014, alone as well. (Item 2) \n \nConcerning his purchase of marijuana, Applicant stated that he never purchased \nmore than a half dozen times. When asked whether he intended to continue using the \nillegal drug in the future he stated: \n \nAs one gets older, the drug simultaneously becomes less interesting and \nthe risks of use gets higher. I realized the benefits of use did not outweigh \nthe risk, and the continued use would both negatively impact my health \nand functioning as well as eliminate various opportunities. Furthermore, \nwhile I am still in contact with some of the people [with whom] I used to \nsmoke marijuana with, I almost never see them, and even if they were to \noffer me some, I wouldn\u2019t want to. Once you stop for [a] long enough \nperiod of time, you don\u2019t\u2019 feel the desire to use anymore, and the drug \nfeels like opening up a can of risks and difficulties for a very little reward. It \nmakes sense to put all of it in the rear view mirror. It is not necessary to \nlive a fulfilling life, and can open yourself up to myriad of other problems. \n(Item 2) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant also disclosed that he illegally used psilocybin mushrooms \n(mushrooms) four times between February 2014 and January 2015. He stated that he \ndid not intend to use mushrooms again, and provided the following explanation: \n \nNot only does psilocybin usage associate itself with the same risks as any \nillegal drug (interactions with criminals, as well as a potential career and \nlegal penalties) but is not even strictly speaking enjoyable . . . . I decided \nthat hallucinogens were not going to provide me with anything other \ndepression and dread. I instead turned my focus to school, friends, and \ncareer. As with my cessation of marijuana use, I allowed those productive \npursuits to grow in the space drugs once occupied.   \n \nOn September 17, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator \nfrom the Office of Personal Management (OPM). He told the interviewer that he illegally \npurchased and used marijuana between January and September 2018, approximately \ntwice per week - about 50 times during the timeframe. Applicant further stated that he \nintended to continue to purchase and use marijuana in the future because it helped him \nwith his depression and loneliness. Applicant was uncomfortable providing the names of \nthose individuals associated with his illegal marijuana use. However, he disclosed that \nhe uses marijuana with his current girlfriend in his apartment and purchases the \nmarijuana from a dispensary. He stated that his use of marijuana has occurred due to \nhis frustration with work. (Item 3) \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied that he intends to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He stated: \u201cI was in a dark space when I began using marijuana that I have \nmoved out. These experiences of being interviewed have shown me what I did wrong.\u201d \n \nApplicant disclosed in his responses to Section 21 (Psychological and Emotional \nHealth) of his 2017 SCA that he was admitted as an inpatient for treatment between \nJune 2015 and May 2017, but he did not explain the cause of his treatment, He did not \ndisclose his diagnosis. It is not clear whether he sought or received any medical or \npsychological treatment or counseling for substance abuse. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.    \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \n\n \n4 \n \n \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.  \n \nBetween 2012 and September 2018, Applicant illegally purchased and used \nmarijuana. He illegally used marijuana after he submitted his June 2017 SCA in which \nhe strongly averred he had no intention of ever using marijuana again. He also \nacknowledged knowing that the use of marijuana was illegal, that it would subject him to \nrisks, eliminate various opportunities, and would expose him to a myriad of problems. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nThe record established the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and \n(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n   (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n   (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n   (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a history of illegal \nmarijuana purchase, possession, and use. Applicant disclosed in his 2017 SCA that he \nillegally used drugs between 2012 and March 2015, and claimed that he had stopped. \nThe 2017 SCA made him further aware that the illegal use of drugs would create a \nsecurity concern and adversely affect his eligibility for a clearance. Notwithstanding, \nApplicant illegally purchased, possessed, and used marijuana, allegedly to cope with his \nloneliness and depression, between January and September 2018. \n \nApplicant\u2019s purchase, possessed, and use of illegal drugs cast doubts on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations, and suitability to hold a clearance, especially because his \nrecent substance misuse occurred after he submitted his 2017 SCA. Applicant\u2019s \nstatements in his 2017 SCA demonstrate that he was aware of the government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns about his illegal drug use and the adverse security consequences. \nNevertheless, he was unable or unwilling to stop using illegal drugs.  \n \nApplicant denied his intent to illegally purchase and use marijuana in the future. \nIn light of the record as a whole, I consider Applicant\u2019s statement to be unreliable and to \nlack credibility. Applicant knew the adverse security clearance consequences of his \nsubstance misuse, and that did not dissuade him. More time without recurrence of \nsubstance misuse is needed for Applicant to establish his reliability, trustworthiness, \nability to comply with laws rules and regulations, and suitability for a clearance. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for a \nfederal contractor since June 2017. He disclosed his substance misuse in his 2017 \nSCA. This is his first clearance application. \n \nThe factors against granting a clearance are more substantial. Applicant\u2019s lack of \njudgment and his unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations continue to raise \nquestions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The sincerity of his commitment to not use any illegal drugs in the \nfuture is unclear. The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Hayes, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/28/2019\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 9, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On May 13, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated June 7, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1) A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 10, 2019, and \nhe was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. It is unclear when Applicant received the FORM as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. After receiving an extension from DOHA, his response was due on September 16, \n2019. Applicant submitted a brief response, which was accepted without objection.  The \ncase was assigned to me on October 22, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nin an unspecified position with his current employer since November 2018. He previously \nserved as a precision measurement equipment laboratory (PMEL) technician with another \ngovernment contractor from May 2006 until September 2015. In September 2015, his \nemployer lost a particular contract, and Applicant was laid off. Between his 2015 layoff \nand his current position, Applicant held several relatively brief part-time and full-time \npositions, separated by periods of unemployment.  \n \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, and served on active duty from March \n1986 until September 1991, when he was honorably discharged. He then served in the \ninactive reserve from May 1991 until December 1993. He received an associate\u2019s degree \nin 1988 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991. He has held secret, top secret, or \u201cQ\u201d clearances \nduring various periods since 1986. He was married in 1983, and divorced in 1997. He \nremarried in 1999, and was divorced in 2003. He has three children, born in 1986, 1988, \nand 1991.  \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can \nbe found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax \nCredit Report, dated July 27, 2018); Item 9 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 14, \n2019); Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 17, 2018); Item 3 (Subject \nContact, dated August 29, 2018); Item 5 (1993 Bankruptcy File, filed March 1, 1993); Item \n6 (1999 Bankruptcy File, filed July 14, 2009); Item 7 (2018 Bankruptcy File, filed March \n22, 2018); Item 2 (SF 86, dated July 9, 2018); and Item 1 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, \ndated July 1, 2019).  \nIn his SF 86, Applicant listed his bankruptcy, filed in March 2018, under Chapter \n13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. He estimated that from about January 2008 until August \n2017, he had incurred gambling losses of $20,000. He added the following comments: \nAlthough my gambling issues are not as severe as they have been several \nyears ago due to the fact that I have been working on this issue and slowly \nprogressing in a positive manner. I do gamble once in a while but less \nfrequently and less amounts in the present (sic). \nI have banned myself for life from the two closest casinos near me which \nhas helped me tremendously. I have also had the help of my son that lives \nwith me as encouragement to not go to any casino, and has accompanied \nme to a casino to help me control what I do while I am there if there is free \nplay and to spend minor amounts. I am continuing to work on this issue as \nI will continue to work on this the rest of my life. The difference in now \ncompared to several years ago is how frequent I go and the amounts I \nspend if I go. I feel like even with this issue it has not affected my ability to \nperform my jobs that I may have had while holding and maintaining a \nclearance. I have also used legal means to handle any financial issues I \nmay have had during those times. I have never engaged in illegal activities \nwhile holding a clearance. I have always worked hard to maintain my \nfinances and live a straight life, but I am human. Once again, I believe any \nfinancial problems I may have had while holding a clearance or not holding \na clearance has not affected my duties or obligations to the United States \nof America. \n(Item 2, at 40) \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.): In August 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from \nthe U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and during the interview, they \ndiscussed Applicant\u2019s gambling habits. Applicant claimed that he started going to casinos \nin January 2008, and he mainly played the slot machines and poker. He generally went \nto the casinos up to four times per week, and started his wagering at $20 per night, \nincreased to $100 each night, and on about five occasions, his entire $900 pay check. In \nan effort to curtail his gambling habits, he voluntarily had himself banned from two of the \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nthree local casinos. Applicant gambled for an escape and a means of relieving stress. \nAlthough he denied that gambling negatively impacted his work, he admitted that he was \ntired at work after being at the casino late the evening before work, and that on some \noccasions, he would take leave from work to rest. He acknowledged that his gambling \naffected his family life because his sons may have felt envious that he was spending \nmoney on gambling rather than giving it to them. \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he does not go to the casino every day, but that when \nhe is at the casino, it is hard for him to leave. He does better when he has a companion \nat the casino who can help him leave. Furthermore, since he filed for bankruptcy in 2018, \nhe does not gamble as frequently because he does not have money to do so, and he has \nto drive 50 miles to the nearest casino from which he is not banned. Although he agrees \nthat he may have had an \u201caddiction\u201d to gambling, he no longer believes that he has an \naddiction, and considers it more of a \u201chabit.\u201d He has never sought counseling or treatment \nfor his gambling, but has done some research on the Internet regarding coping strategies. \nIf he felt his gambling was out of control to cope with, he would voluntarily seek help. \nApplicant intends to not go to casinos any more, and if his financial status improves, he \nwill try to abstain from going to casinos or by going less often. (Item 3, at 7) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had filed for bankruptcy on three occasions, in \nMarch 1993; July 2009; and March 2018. It also alleged that his financial problems are \nthe result of his gambling habits, and that he continues to gamble at casinos, despite his \nongoing financial difficulties.  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.): On March 1, 1993, Applicant and his wife filed a joint voluntary \npetition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, not Chapter 13, as erroneously alleged in the \nSOR. Because there were no reported assets, an unspecified amount of liabilities was \ndischarged on June 14, 1993, and the case was terminated on June 17, 1993. (Item 5) \nAlthough Applicant admitted the allegation, he noted that he was under the impression \nthat the bankruptcy was actually under Chapter 7, but he could not recall the specifics of \nthe bankruptcy. (Item 1) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): On July 14, 2009, Applicant filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy \nunder Chapter 13. He listed nearly $159,300 in liabilities, including nearly $79,000 in \ncreditors holding secured claims (a timeshare, two mortgages, county taxes, and a \nvehicle); nearly $3,000 in creditors holding unsecured priority claims (attorney fees); and \nnearly $78,000 in creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims (credit cards and charge \naccounts). He estimated that his net monthly income was nearly $3,900; and his average \nmonthly expenses were nearly $3,100, leaving him approximately $800 available for \ndiscretionary spending or savings. Applicant claimed that his 2007 income from \nemployment was nearly $56,500; his 2008 income from employment was nearly $58, 500; \nand his 2009 income from employment at the time of the filing was nearly $31,000. He \nalso reported two additional sources of income during 2007: $1,440 and $11,200 from \ngambling. It was determined that Applicant had available nearly $450 in monthly \ndisposable income. Although the available exhibit does not include a bankruptcy trustee\u2019s \nreport, and there is no indication as to payments made to creditors, an unspecified \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \npayment plan was confirmed in September 2009, and the debtor was discharged on June \n11, 2014. The case was terminated on August 8, 2014. (Item 6) Applicant contended that \nhe paid the trustee about $50,000, or $800 per month over a period of five years, and that \nhe relinquished a house worth about $59,000. (Item 1) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): Less than four years after his 2009 bankruptcy was discharged, on \nMarch 22, 2018, Applicant again filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter \n13. He listed nearly $64,900 in liabilities, including nearly $11,500 in creditors holding \nsecured claims (a vehicle); nearly $4,200 in creditors holding unsecured priority claims \n(attorney fees, and federal and state income taxes from the 2017 tax year); and nearly \n$49,300 in creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims (credit cards, charge accounts, \nand medical accounts). He estimated that his net monthly income was nearly $2,200; and \nhis average monthly expenses were nearly $1,900, leaving him approximately $300 \navailable for discretionary spending or savings. Applicant claimed that his 2016 income \nfrom employment was nearly $37,000; his 2017 income from employment was nearly \n$33,900; and his 2018 income from employment at the time of the filing was nearly \n$3,500. He also reported additional sources of income during 2016: $7,440 from \nunemployment; and for 2017: $4,500 from gambling. It was determined that Applicant \nhad available nearly $300 in monthly disposable income. Under the approved Bankruptcy \nPayment Plan, Applicant was to make total payments of $18,300, or monthly payments \nof $305, to the trustee for a period of 60 months. The payment plan was confirmed in May \n2018. (Item 7; Item 4)  \nApplicant contended that he started making his monthly $305 payments on April \n21, 2018, and that he has made those payments now for over one year. (Item 1) However, \nhe failed to submit any documents, such as cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a \nbank register, receipts, allotment authorization, or an updated report from the Bankruptcy \nTrustee, to support his contentions that payments are being made. \nOn August 21, 2018, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Worksheet. In it, he \nreported a $2,442 net monthly income from his position at that time. However, based on \nhis anticipated new and current position, he modified his estimate upward to $3,058. He \nhad $1,703 in monthly expenses, including the $305 payments to the trustee; and a \nmonthly remainder of $739 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. \nThere is no evidence of a budget. Other than the on-line credit counseling associated with \nhis bankruptcies, there is no evidence of financial counseling. There is no evidence that \nhe ever received treatment for his gambling problem. \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts; and \n \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by \ngambling. \nApplicant has a gambling problem, characterized by him as being formerly an \n\u201caddiction,\u201d but now merely a \u201chabit.\u201d His gambling has caused some issues in both his \nprofessional and family lives, and, by his own estimation, he has incurred gambling losses \nof at least $20,000. Also, in part, due to his gambling and failure to maintain his accounts \nin a current status, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 1993, and he had his \nliabilities discharged. He filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in 2009, with over \n$159,000 in liabilities, and apparently after making monthly $800 payments to the trustee, \ntotaling $50,000, and relinquishing a house worth about $59,000, that bankruptcy was \ndischarged. Less than four years later, he filed for bankruptcy again under Chapter 13, \nwith nearly $64,900 in liabilities. Under the approved Bankruptcy Payment Plan, Applicant \nwas to make total payments of $18,300, or monthly payments of $305, to the trustee for \na period of 60 months. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(e), 19(h), and 19(i) have been established, \nbut there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless \nof an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failures to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to \nremain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. His Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nwiped away his delinquent debts. His 2009 bankruptcy saw him resolve only about \n$109,000 of his over $159,000 liabilities when, over a period of five years, he relinquished \na residence and made only $50,000 in debt payments. His 2018 bankruptcy with $64,900 \nin liabilities, is expected to see him make total payments of $18,300, or monthly payments \nof $305, to the trustee for a period of 60 months, meaning some debts will not be resolved.  \n \nWhile Applicant contends that he has changed his gambling habits, he still \ngambles, in spite of placing some interference blocks in his way by getting banned from \ntwo of the three casinos near him, and by taking along his son or someone else to control \nhim. Thus, his gambling frequency may have been reduced, but his continuing pattern of \ngambling still persists. Furthermore, Applicant has never completed any inpatient or \noutpatient treatment related to his gambling condition. Also, because Applicant fails to \nunderstand the full significance of his gambling problem by claiming his former gambling \naddiction is now merely a gambling habit, he continues to be a problem gambler and not \nmerely an \u201cat-risk\u201d gambler. Thus, his gambling problem is expected to continue, and it \nmay recur at its former level. \n  \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, Applicant has relied on the bankruptcy options on three \noccasions during a 25-year period to resolve some of his delinquent debts. There are \nunverified comments by Applicant that he has started to resolve his most recent \ndelinquent accounts, with approved payment plan, but he offered no documentation to \nsupport his contentions. He offered no documentation to indicate payments have been \nmade to the trustee or that the trustee has made payments to any creditors. His \ncontentions regarding the status of some accounts in the payment plan, and his unverified \ncomments claiming that he had taken certain actions, without documents, to support his \nclaims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith actions. The Appeal Board has previously \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nexplained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \nWhile filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 is more reasonable and responsible \nthan simply ignoring delinquent debts, Applicant\u2019s course of conduct with respect to his \naccounts indicates that he ignores those accounts for lengthy periods before turning to \nthe bankruptcy option. As stated above, with the exception of the online credit counseling \nassociated with the bankruptcies, there is no evidence of financial counseling. There is \nno evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of gambling treatment. In the absence of \nsuch information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially (and emotionally with regard to his gambling) than he had been. \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving in an \nunspecified position with his current employer since November 2018. He previously \nserved as a PMEL technician with another government contractor from May 2006 until \nSeptember 2015, when his employer lost a particular contract, and Applicant was laid off. \nBetween his 2015 layoff and his current position, Applicant held several relatively brief \npart-time and full-time positions, separated by periods of unemployment. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Air Force, and served on active duty from March 1986 until September 1991, \nwhen he was honorably discharged, and then served in the inactive reserve from May \n1991 until December 1993. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 1988 and a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1991. He has held secret, top secret, or \u201cQ\u201d clearances during various periods \nsince 1986. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant has a gambling problem, characterized by him as being formerly \nan addiction, but now merely a habit. His gambling has caused some issues in both his \nprofessional and family lives, and, by his own estimation, he has incurred gambling losses \nof at least $20,000. Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in 1993, and he had \nhis liabilities discharged. He filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in 2009, with over \n$159,000 in liabilities, and with $50,000 in payments to the trustee, and a relinquished \nhouse worth about $59,000, that bankruptcy was discharged in 2014. Less than four \nyears later, he filed for bankruptcy again under Chapter 13, with nearly $64,900 in \nliabilities. Under the approved Bankruptcy Payment Plan, Applicant is expected to make \ntotal payments of $18,300 to the trustee for a period of 60 months, but he failed to submit \nany documents to reflect any payments to the trustee or any payments by the trustee to \nthe creditors. Nevertheless, Applicant continues to gamble, albeit at a reduced level. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has chosen his preferred method of handling his delinquent debts by \neither having them discharged under Chapter 7, or eventually paying off many of them by \nentering payment plans under Chapter 13. While Applicant contended that he took certain \nactions with respect to his most recent delinquent debts and his most recent Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, he submitted no documentary evidence to indicate that he is actually paying \nthe trustee the mandated amount or that the trustee has made any payments to the \ncreditors. Considering Applicant\u2019s continuing gambling habits, and his previous gambling \nlosses, his current track record is poor or fair at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me \nwith substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 24, 2017. \nOn April 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1) Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on July 30, 2019.  Applicant received the \nFORM on August 5, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM and \n\n2 \n \nidentified as Items 1 through 6, is admitted without objection. Applicant provided a \nresponse to the FORM, which is marked as AX A. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 24, 2019. Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old who is being sponsored for employment with a federal \ncontractor. He reported no military service. In 2013, he married and has one child, born \nin 2015. Applicant has not held an industrial security clearance and is sponsored by the \ndefense contractor with whom he has been employed since August 2017. (Item 3) \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degee in April 2008. He disclosed his financial issues on \nhis SCA. (Item 3) \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-f. that amount to approximately \n$33,862. Applicant admitted the allegations listed in the SOR, and noted that two \naccounts have been resolved. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in September 2015, when his company \nunexpectedly did not receive a contract extension, and he had no employment.  His first \nchild was born in April 2015, which exacerbated his financial issues. He was unemployed \nfrom 2015 until 2017, and he stayed home to take care of his son while his wife worked. \n(Item 4) He used his savings to pay bills and expenses. When Applicant found \nemployment in 2017, the pay was significantly lower. He was able to pay his current bills \nbut he began to fall behind in his mortgage and other accounts. (Response to FORM)  \nHowever, he has not incurred any new debt. \n \n \nIn his SCA, Applicant explained that another contributing factor to his financial \nproblems was significant storm damage to his property for which he paid a large \ndeductible to have the repairs handled by insurance. His wife also had unanticipated \nmedical issues that required large out-of-pocket expenses. (Item 3) The unforeseen \nexpenses continued to deplete his savings. In that same SCA, Applicant explained that \nhe reached out to a company for assistance but it did not work out. His first idea was to \nobtain a consolidation loan, but he was not approved. He revealed that he was prioritizing \nhis debts  to have them paid one at a time. (Item 3)  He also reported that he reached out \nto creditors. All of these efforts were reported in his SCA and before the SOR was issued. \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s August 2018 interview, he clarified that he worked in \nAfghanistan and Iraq as a civilian contractor during the years of 2010 through 2014. (Item \n4) He  also mentioned his foreign travel to other places which were the result of traveling \nto or from his work abroad. He mentioned that he made a trip to Mexico in 2018 for a day \nor two when he was in San Diego. He explained that other trips were paid for by his family  \nworking abroad or were stop-overs coming from his work abroad.  (Item 4)  He also listed \n\n3 \n \nthe travel on his SCA. He had no financial issues and his earlier credit report confirms \nthat many accounts paid as agreed. (Items 5, 6 )   \n \n \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, Applicant made his past-due mortgage account his \npriority. He was approximately $33,429 past due. He submitted documentation that he \nhas resolved this major issue. He began making timely payment in November 2018. He \nprovided a statement from his bank that confirms the account is in a current status. \n(Attachment to Answer) One of the documents shows that as of May 2019, he had paid \nyear to date $13,476 (his regular monthly payment is $1,807.)  \n \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.b is a collection account with a bank. The delinquent amount \nis $10,844. Applicant made an agreement and had a plan in place in September 2018. \nHe provided documentation to the investigator; however, in his response to the FORM, \nhe realized that there was a payment error and the company refused to honor the previous \nagreement.  He could not find the statement, but he is now  disputing the  amount that \nthe bank is citing as being accurate. He has requested more information and is awaiting \na response. The agreed upon settlement amount was $4,900, noted in a letter dated \nSeptember 2018. (Attachment to Answer) (Response to FORM) \n \n \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $8,303, and as \nnoted in SOR \u00b6 1.d this is the same bank that he is working with. Since there are two \nbank accounts, the Applicant and creditor are working toward a \u201cstaggered  repayment \nplan.\u201d They are cooperatively negotiating a manageable payment amount to resolve the \ndebt. SOR allegation \u00b61.d is a charged-off account in the amount of $7,654. Applicant \nhas been working with the creditor to reconcile the account. There will be a settlement, \nbut he has not received the paperwork. \n \n \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e, a charged-off credit account in the amount of $7,061, \nApplicant set a repayment agreement and provided a copy. The settlement amount was \n$4,237 and noted a payment of $176. He completed the auto-draft documentation, but he \ndisclosed in his Response to the FORM that when he received the SOR, he learned that \nthe payments had not gone through correctly. He contacted the company and sent \nanother payment. The repayment plan is scheduled to end in  April, 2021. SOR allegation \n\u00b61.f, a collection account for $352, has been resolved. (Item 2 ) \n \n \nApplicant has a plan in place and accepts full responsibility for the debts. The \nGovernment acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial situation appears to have been \nsignificantly impacted by his loss of employment just months before the birth of his child. \n(FORM)  Applicant was candid in that he believes he made some mistakes but believes \nthis is unlikely to recur. He has a financial history that reflects good employment and \naccounts that were current. He supported his family while unemployed, used his savings \nand took a job with a significantly lower salary. He has incurred no new debts. He made \na plan to prioritize the delinquent debts beginning with his mortgage. He resolved a \nsignificant amount. He is current with his home mortgage. He contacted creditors and \nmade payment plans. He paid another small debt. He noted that he had to work the plans \nin with his budget so that he had sufficient money to make a monthly payment. Applicant \n\n4 \n \nhas had some snags with two payment agreements and explained the situation. He is \ndisputing another account and noted it on his SCA in 2017. He did not shirk from his \ndelinquent bills. He had taken actions before the SOR was issued. He made an early \nattempt with a debt consolidater, but it was not successful. He also reached out to a credit \ncompany, but found them to be of no help. He was trying to be proactive after returning \nto the United States. \n \n \nWhen he worked abroad as a civilian contractor, he lived in military housing. He \nhad a NACI but no security clearance. As to trips he made while abroad, some of those \nplaces were stop overs on his way home. (Item 3) He also responded to the inquiry about \ntrips and travels made overseas. He explained that he also has family who work and live \nabroad and his family paid for the trips. (Response to FORM) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also works outside their home and has received a promotion. \nApplicant now has steady employment. He did not provide evidence of financial \ncounseling. He provided no references.  \n \n \n. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\n5 \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n\n6 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and other documentation in the record reflect his \ndelinquent debts. Two disqualifying conditions under this guideline are established: AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unexpected unemployment coinciding with the birth of his first child and \ntransition back to the United States after working as a civilian contractor abroad were \nevents beyond his control and caused him to fall behind on his mortgage and some \naccounts. From 2015 until 2017, Applicant was unemployed. His wife had medical issues \nand Applicant incurred more unforeseen debt. He began addressing the situation and \nprioritized his debts. His first concern was his home mortgage which has been brought to \na current status. The mortgage was about  $33,000 past due. As of May 2019, Applicant \npaid $13,476. His regular monthly payment is $1,809. He reached out to creditors and \ntried debt consolidation. He arranged payment plans and paid another small debt. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts can be considered recent, but are unlikely to recur. His \nfinancial problems were due to circumstances beyond his control. The Government \nagreed with this. His actions to resolve the debts are timely and reasonable in this case, \nif not fully efficacious under the circumstances. He has settled one debt and has a \npayment plan for others. He has had some snags with two plans. He is addressing those \nissues. He has shown good faith. Applicant meets the mitigating factors for financial \nconsiderations.  \n\n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has never held a security clearance. He has worked for a number of \nyears as a contractor, but he was unexpectedly unemployed in 2015 for two years. \nApplicant provided for his family and paid household expenses. He acquired no new debt \nafter obtaining employment. He made good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. \nHis priority was his home mortgage, the largest debt, and he has shown that he brought \nthe account  to a current status.  He also sought a consolidation loan, but did not succeed. \nHe paid another small debt. His past financial history as reflected in his credit bureau \nreports is good.   \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has stated that an Applicant need not have paid every debt \nalleged in the SOR, need not pay the SOR debts first, and need not be paying on all debts \nsimultaneously. Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic plan to \nresolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant action to resolve his debts, \nand he has documented significant action to resolve his debts. The fact that he is in the \nmiddle of his negotiations with two payment plans, does not constitute a security concern \ngiven his lengthy incident-free history. I conclude Guideline F for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \ngranted. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 26, 2018. On April \n15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 3, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record. On July 19, 2019, he requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on July 24, 2019, and the case was assigned \n\n \n2 \n \nto me on August 27, 2019. On the same day, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 25, 2019.  \n \nOn September 12, 2019, Applicant requested a continuance until mid-October so \nthat a court hearing on garnishment of his wages could be completed before his DOHA \nhearing. I denied his request but informed him that I would keep the record open until \nOctober 18, 2019, to enable him to provide documentation regarding the status of the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. I convened the hearing on September 25, 2019, as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through L, which \nwere admitted without objection.  \n \nI kept the record open until October 18, 2019, as promised. I also informed \nApplicant that I would entertain a request to reopen the hearing if he believed that any \ndocuments submitted after the hearing were not self-explanatory. He did not submit any \nadditional documentary evidence or request that the hearing be reopened. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old database manager employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2008. He worked in non-government jobs from January 1999 to October \n2007. He was unemployed from October 2007 until he was hired by his current employer. \nHe received a security clearance in January 2008. \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1984, divorced in December 2005, and married again in \nJuly 2010. He has a 32-year-old son who is currently incarcerated and three stepchildren, \nages 25, 26, and 28. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he incurred legal expenses of about $2,500 in April 2014, \nwhen his adult stepdaughter attacked him, was charged with domestic assault, and filed \na complaint against Applicant for domestic assault. Although the stepdaughter\u2019s \ncomplaint was dismissed, Applicant incurred legal fees defending himself against his \nstepdaughter\u2019s complaint. The stepdaughter no longer lives in the household, and \nApplicant has had no contact with her for more than a year. (GX 2 at 7.) He did not provide \nany documentation of his legal fees. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son was charged with rape in September 2014. He was convicted in \nJuly 2015, and his appeal of his conviction was not successful. (GX 2 at 5.) Although his \nson is an adult, Applicant felt obligated to assist him with his legal expenses. He believes \nthat his son is innocent. He agreed at the hearing that his decision to help his son was \nvoluntary and was not a legal obligation. (Tr. 71.) He testified that he spent $15,000 to \n\n \n3 \n \n$20,000 for legal fees. He and his wife devoted their incomes to pay the legal fees and \nused credit cards for living expenses. As the legal fees continued to accumulate, he and \nhis wife were unable to pay their credit-card accounts. (GX 2 at 7-8; Tr. 53.) Applicant did \nnot submit any documentation of the legal fees for his son\u2019s defense at trial and \nsubsequent appeal. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he had medical bills in an unspecified amount for treatment \nof prostate cancer in 2013, and his wife incurred medical bills of about $2,500 for arthritis \nand physical therapy around 2017. Finally, he testified that he incurred about $800 in \nunexpected car repairs. (Tr. 55-57.) He provided no documentation of these expenses.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $61,380. In December \n2017, Applicant signed an agreement with a debt-resolution company to handle the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.g. His agreement required him to deposit $1,063 per month into a \n\u201csettlement account.\u201d (AX A.) He testified that he terminated this agreement and replaced \nit with a debt-negotiation agreement with another company in June 2019. This debt-\nnegotiation program requires Applicant to pay $723 per month, and the estimated \nprogram length is 53 months. This program is handling the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. (AX B.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that in June 2019, his net monthly income was about $6,149 \nand his expenses were about $2,735, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $679. (Tr. \n44-46.) He testified that he expected his income to change because a new company was \ntaking over the contract under which he was working. (Tr. 44-47.) He also testified that \nhe had a detailed and accurate income and expense record at home and that he would \nsubmit it after the hearing. (Tr. 51.) However, he did not present any additional \ninformation. \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. The \ndebts are reflected in credit reports from February 2018 and February 2019. (GX 4; GX \n5.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card account charged off for $14,516. This debt was included \nin the debt-resolution program but has not been resolved. The creditor filed a garnishment \npetition, and a hearing on the petition was scheduled for September 26, 2019, the day \nafter the hearing. (AX C.) Applicant provided no additional evidence regarding the \noutcome of the hearing. The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $13,597. This debt was included \nin the debt-resolution program and the debt-negotiation program, but it has not been \nresolved. In July 2019, the creditor filed a warrant in debt against Applicant. The creditor \nsought to garnish Applicant\u2019s pay and the hearing on the garnishment summons was \nscheduled for September 26, 2019, the day after the hearing. (AX D.) The hearing was \npostponed until October 10, 2019. Applicant testified that he hoped that this hearing would \nresult in a negotiated settlement rather than a garnishment. (Tr. 64.) Applicant provided \n\n \n4 \n \nno evidence regarding the outcome of the hearing and no evidence regarding resolution \nof the debt. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: unsecured loan charged off for $8,185. This debt was included in \nthe debt-resolution program and the debt-negotiation program. In Applicant\u2019s answer to \nthe SOR, he provided evidence that the creditor agreed to settle the debt for $5,698 in \nOctober 2018, to be paid through his debt-resolution plan in 11 installments. However, at \nthe hearing, he testified that he had terminated his contract with the debt-resolution \ncompany, that the debt was not yet resolved, and that no further negotiations were \nunderway. (Tr. 59.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $956. The February 2019 credit \nreport reflected that the balance on this debt was $4,262 the payments were past due for \n$956, and the account was charged off. (GX 4 at 2.) This debt was included in the debt-\nresolution program but had not been resolved when Applicant responded to the SOR. In \nJanuary 2019, Applicant received an offer to settle the debt for $1,407. (AX E.) There is \nno evidence that he accepted the offer. He testified that \u201csome payments\u201d had been made \non the debt, but he submitted no documentary evidence reflecting any payments. (Tr. 59.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit-card account charge off for $4,046. This debt was included \nin the debt-resolution program and the debt-negotiation program. In August 2018, the \ncreditor agreed to settle the debt for $1,718, to be paid in $50 monthly installments until \nAugust 2019 and $100 installments thereafter. (Answer to SOR; AX G.) Applicant \nsubmitted evidence of one $50 payment on February 27, 2019. (AX F.) He did not submit \nevidence of any other payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: department store charge account charged off for $3,373. This debt \nwas included in the debt-resolution program and the debt-negotiation program. The \noriginal debt was for $4,497. In September 2018, the creditor agreed to settle it for $3,373. \n(Answer to SOR) The February 2019 credit report reflects that the debt was charged off \nfor $3,373. (GX 4 at 2.) In September 2019, Applicant received an offer to settle this debt \nfor $1,476. (AX H.) There is no evidence that he accepted the offer or made any payments \non the debt. He testified that this creditor was receiving payments from his debt-resolution \ncompany, but he submitted no documentary evidence reflecting any payments. (Tr. 60.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: credit-card account charged off for $771. This debt was included in \nthe debt-resolution program and the debt-negotiation program. The February 2019 credit \nreport reflected that the balance on this account was $2,202, that it was past due for $771, \nand that the account had been charged off. In May 2019, Applicant received a settlement \noffer from the same creditor, but it appears to apply to another debt not alleged in the \nSOR, because the account number and the balance due do not match the debt reflected \nin the February 2019 credit report. (AX I.) He testified that his debt-resolution company \nhad made \u201csome payments\u201d on this debt and that the debt-negotiation company was \nnegotiating with the creditor, but he submitted no documentary evidence reflecting any \npayments or a payment agreement. (Tr. 60.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: time-share account charged off for $15,936. Applicant acquired this \nproperty for $15,000 in September 2015, before his son\u2019s legal problems arose. (GX 3 at \n5; Tr. 68.) He cancelled his purchase contract after paying about $1,000. In July 2017, he \nhired a credit-repair company to challenge this debt. The debt was cancelled in November \n2017 and an IRS Form 1099-C was issued. (AX J.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n \n6 \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous and recent. His \nson\u2019s legal problems and his altercations with his stepdaughter were unusual \ncircumstances. His son has exhausted his legal appeals, and the stepdaughter no longer \nlives in the household, making similar legal expenses unlikely to recur. However, the other \ndebts alleged in the SOR were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant voluntarily paid his son\u2019s \nlegal expenses, but he provided no documentary evidence of the amount of the expenses. \nHe described multiple situations that could qualify as conditions beyond his control, but \nhe submitted no documentary evidence of the situations or their financial impact, He \nprovided no documentation of his uninsured medical bills and car repair bills. He hired \nseveral companies to help him resolve his debts, but he has not monitored their progress \nand was unable to describe what they had accomplished in any detail. He is not making \nany payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. He received settlement \noffers for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f, but he submitted no evidence that he had \naccepted the offers or made the required payments. It is reasonable to expect an \napplicant to present documentary evidence showing resolution of specific debts. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debt-resolution, debt-negotiation, and \ncredit-repair companies are not the type of credit-counseling institutions contemplated by \nthis mitigating condition. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the debt for the time share property alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h. Applicant has not disputed any of the other debts alleged in the SOR. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 14, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct, Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and Guideline I, psychological conditions. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 4, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on September \n10, 2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 9. Applicant submitted a response \nto the FORM, which was marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections \nto Items 1 through 9 or AE A, and all are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned \nto me on October 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 25 years old. He graduated from high school in 2012 and began \nworking for a federal contractor the same year. He was granted a security clearance in \n2012. He married in 2016. He and his wife are expecting a child.  \n \nIn February 2017, Applicant and his wife purchased home and it caused financial \nstrain and led to a conflict with his wife. They began seeing a marriage counselor, who \nreferred Applicant to a psychiatrist. In October 2017, Applicant was diagnosed by the \npsychiatrist with moderate bipolar disorder. He was prescribed a medication as a mood \nstabilizer. The psychiatrist discussed the importance of Applicant being compliant with his \ntreatment plan, including taking his medication. (Items 6, 7) \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant had an argument with his wife, during which he threw \na bottle and punched a wall. He denied he hit his wife. He told his wife he was going to \nkill himself. She called the police because she was concerned for his safety. He was \narrested and transported voluntarily to a hospital. During the psychiatric evaluation at the \nhospital, he admitted to a recent suicide gesture that involved putting a handful of his \nprescribed medication for bipolar disorder in his mouth, but then spitting them out. He \ndescribed to the psychiatrist that this was a cry for attention from his wife and that he had \nno actual intent on killing himself. He also disclosed to the psychiatrist that he had used \nmarijuana occasionally since he was 15 years old, and he had last used it several weeks \nprior to his hospitalization (November 2017). (Items 6, 7) \n \nThe arrest in November 2017 resulted in a disorderly conduct charge and a \nprotective order barring him from assaulting, threatening, abusing, harassing, or \notherwise harming his wife. He was not prevented from having contact with his wife. He \nwas also ordered to attend a nine-week course on family violence. He was advised the \nmatter would be expunged from his record since it was his first offense. In January 2018, \nhe was ordered by the court to continue his mental health counseling. When Applicant \nwas interviewed by a government investigator in May 2018, the matter had not been \nexpunged, but Applicant resumed living with his wife without incident. (Item 8) \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDue to the above incident, which was reported by Applicant to his employer, he \nwas required to complete a new security clearance application (SCA) in December 2017. \nIn his SCA, Applicant reported his arrest and bipolar diagnosis. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestions asking if he had used any illegal drugs in the past seven years or while holding \na security clearance. He was interviewed under oath by a government investigator on \nMay 9, 2018. He told the investigator that he had not used illegal drugs or a controlled \nsubstance in the past seven years. On May 29, 2019, he was interviewed again under \noath by a government investigator. He was confronted with his November 2017 disclosure \nto the psychiatrist about his marijuana use, where he self-reported that he used marijuana \nsince he was 15 years old, and his last use was a few weeks prior to his hospitalization. \nHe also self-reported to the psychiatrist that he occasionally used marijuana on a monthly \nor less than monthly basis. Applicant told the government investigator that if that was the \ninformation on record, then yes, he had used marijuana. (Items 3, 5, 9) \n \nWhen asked by the investigator how often Applicant used marijuana, he stated he \nhad not used it since before November 2017, and he seldom used it before then. He told \nthe investigator he could not recall his prior uses. When confronted with why he failed to \ndisclose his marijuana use on his December 2017 SCA and during his May 9, 2018 \ninterview, he stated he omitted this information because he was afraid of losing his job. \nHe stated he used marijuana once or twice a year with his sister-in-law. He never \npurchased it and only used it when it was offered to him by her and two other friends. He \nused marijuana because it made him feel calm and relaxed. When asked why he used \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance, he did not have an explanation. He told the \ninvestigator that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Applicant used marijuana \nwith varying frequency after being granted a security clearance from 2012 until 2017. \n(Item 5) \n \nThe DOD CAF requested Applicant submit to a psychological evaluation. He was \nevaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist (LCP) in January 2019. During his evaluation \nhe disclosed that he intentionally omitted his marijuana use when he completed his SCA \nbecause he was afraid of losing his job. Due to discrepancies the LCP opined that it \nappeared Applicant continued to evidence poor candor when discussing his marijuana \nuse. Applicant disclosed that he previously was treated by a psychiatrist who prescribed \nhim a \u201cmood stabilizer.\u201d He could not recall the name of the medicine. He took it for about \na year, but said that while using it he felt \u201cout of it\u201d and often fatigued. He decided to stop \ntaking the medicine on his accord, and did not return to his psychiatrist to taper off the \nmedication. (Item 4) \n \nThe LCP evaluation concluded that she did not find evidence of bipolar disorder, \nbut found Applicant clearly evinces signs of poor anger control and impulsive behaviors. \nShe noted Applicant used poor judgment by unilaterally discontinuing his medication \nregimen prescribed for his mood lability. She noted that \u201cit appears more likely that his \nmood lability is part of a personality disorder, rather than a manic episode, per se, mood \nstabilizers are often used to assist individuals with personality disorders manage their \nmood states.\u201d (Item 4) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe LCP further noted that Applicant was not forthcoming with information, which \nlimited her ability to clearly determine the diagnosis, but she noted there were notable \nindications, specifically, \u201che displays impairments in affectivity, difficulties in interpersonal \nfunction, lack of remorse for his actions, deceitfulness, aggressiveness, and poor impulse \ncontrol.\u201d (Item 4) She concluded the following: \n \n[Applicant] did not divulge that the mental health treatment he received was \nordered by the court. He also did not report a psychiatric hospitalization, \nonly that he was briefly evaluated at a hospital following an arrest for \ndomestic violence. He down played his domestic violence history, and \nanger management issues. He did not report the rate of marijuana use \nnoted within the investigation records. He was generally guarded, and his \ninsight into his problematic behaviors was poor. He is not in treatment for \nthe issues that have led to violent outbursts in the past, making him a risk \nfor future outbursts. In sum, the aforementioned behaviors of concern \nindicate that [Applicant\u2019s] psychological condition impairs his judgment and \nreliability; his personality disturbance makes him a security risk; and his \nprognosis is guarded. (Item 4) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he has been a diligent \nemployee for seven years. He has applied for a new position to better himself. He \nvoluntarily disclosed his arrest to his supervisor. He completed the requirements imposed \nby the court after his arrest. He and his wife attended marriage counseling for a couple of \nmonths. He has noticed a change in his life for the better. He has learned to control \nhimself and home life has improved. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative.  \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on his December 2017 SCA when he \nfailed to disclose his illegal use of marijuana with varying frequency from about 2010 until \n2017 and while holding a security clearance after 2012. Applicant deliberately falsified \nmaterial facts during his interview with a government investigator in May 2018, when he \ndenied any illegal drug use in the last seven years. Applicant admitted he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from 2010 to 2017 and while holding a security clearance after \n2012. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant was not completely \nforthcoming during his psychological evaluation with the LCP. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nThe DOD CAF relies on people to be forthcoming and honest on their SCA, even \nwhen it involves derogatory information. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because deliberately \nfailing to disclose information on an SCA and swearing to its accuracy is not a minor \noffense. When asked by a government investigator, under oath, if he used illegal drugs \nin the past, he denied any use. He deliberately lied to the government investigator. It was \nnot until he was confronted with the information that he indicated that if the record said \nhe used marijuana then it was accurate. Applicant did not voluntarily disclose his past \ndrug use and continued to be deceptive. He was not forthcoming during his psychological \nevaluation, which prevented the LCP from making a more accurate diagnosis. I find \nApplicant\u2019s omissions, concealments and falsifications are serious and cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG 17(a) does not apply. \n \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG & 27:  \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n \n(c) voluntarily or involuntarily inpatient hospitalization; and  \n \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s anger issues led to a charge of domestic violence. His suicide gesture, \nwhich he indicated was not serious, led to his wife contacting the police and his \nhospitalization where he was treated by a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with bipolar \ndisorder. He was ordered by the court to continue treatment. He was prescribed \nmedication by the psychiatrist, but discontinued it on his own accord, without consultation \nwith his treating psychiatrist. It was not alleged that he failed to follow a treatment plan. \nHe did fail to continue his mental health counseling ordered by a court in January 2018. \nThe DOD CAF ordered a psychological evaluation. THE LCP did not agree with the \nprevious diagnosis of bipolar disorder. However, the LCP was unable to provide an \naccurate diagnosis because Applicant was uncooperative. Therefore, the evidence is \ninsufficient to conclude that Appellant was diagnosed with a psychological or psychiatric \ncondition. AG \u00b6 28 (d) does not apply. The LCP diagnosed Applicant with an unspecified \npersonality disorder, but not a condition. However, Applicant\u2019s uncooperative behavior, \nsuicide gesture, and failure to be completely candid with the LCP and his hospitalization \ncasts doubt on his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28 (a) and \n28 (c) apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \n \n \nApplicant did not offer any evidence that he has resumed psychological counseling \nor treatment. The current prognosis by the LCP is guarded. Because Applicant failed to \nbe candid during his evaluation, the LCP has concerns that Applicant\u2019s behavior may \ncontinue to raise concerns about his judgment and reliability and his personality \ndisturbance makes him a security risk. There is insufficient evidence to apply any of the \nmitigating conditions.  \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 2010 to 2017. He told his \npsychiatrist that his last use was weeks before his November 2017 hospitalization. He \nused marijuana with his sister-in-law. He did not purchase it but used it when offered by \nher and occasionally friends. Applicant use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance began in 2012 and continued to 2017. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \n \nApplicant was consistently dishonest about his drug use. He stated to the \ngovernment investigator that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future, but other \nthan this statement, he failed to offer evidence to corroborate his commitment. He used \nmarijuana with his sister-in-law, but did not indicate that he would disassociate himself \nfrom her, tell her that he will no longer use marijuana with her, or that she should not bring \nit when she visits. He has not provided a signed statement of his commitment to abstain \nfrom illegal drug use. There is no evidence he has participated in drug treatment and has \na favorable prognosis. Applicant knowingly used marijuana for years while holding a \nsecurity clearance and has failed to provide persuasive evidence that marijuana use is \nunlikely to recur. His drug use while holding a security clearance casts doubt on his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, H, and I in \nmy whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 25 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since 2012 and \nheld a security clearance during that time. He repeatedly used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance. He deliberately failed to disclose his past marijuana use on his SCA, \nand he deliberately concealed this information when he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator. He was not candid when being evaluated by the Government\u2019s LCP. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct, Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and Guideline I, psychological conditions. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline H, the Government alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 1975 and at least November 2016 (SOR 1.a); and that she used marijuana while on active duty in the U.S. Air Force between 1980 and 2000, and while holding security clearances during and after her military service (SOR 1.b). Under Guideline E, it was alleged that Applicant intentionally made false statements to the Government in her January 2017 e-QIP by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the e-QIP Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) question asking if she had ever used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, as alleged in SOR 1.b (SOR 2.a). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a and 1.b, but denied, with explanation, SOR 2.a. (FORM, Item 1) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom she has worked since January 2017. She was married from October 1974 until divorcing in May 1984, and she had two children, now adults, from that marriage.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n11/12/2019 \nDecision \nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information in response to the Government\u2019s \ncase to overcome the security concerns raised by her use of marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance, and by her deliberate false statements about her involvement with \nillegal drugs. Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 28, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nas part of her employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the completed \nbackground investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information, as \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 \n(Directive). \n \nOn May 9, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and E (Personal Conduct). The adjudicative guidelines cited in the \nSOR were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be \neffective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to the \nSOR (Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing. \n \nOn July 26, 2019, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department \nCounsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained seven documents (Items 1 \u2013 7) \non which the Government relies to establish the facts alleged in the SOR. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on August 23, 2019, and she was informed she had 30 days from the \ndate of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the FORM and to submit \nadditional information in response to the FORM. The record closed on September 22, \n2019, after Applicant did not respond to the FORM or object to the consideration of any \nof the Government\u2019s exhibits. I received this case for decision on October 22, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline H, the Government alleged that Applicant used marijuana with \nvarying frequency between 1975 and at least November 2016 (SOR 1.a); and that she \nused marijuana while on active duty in the U.S. Air Force between 1980 and 2000, and \nwhile holding security clearances during and after her military service (SOR 1.b). \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, it was alleged that Applicant intentionally made false \nstatements to the Government in her January 2017 e-QIP by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the e-QIP \nSection 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) question asking if she had ever used \nillegal drugs while holding a security clearance, as alleged in SOR 1.b (SOR 2.a).  \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a and 1.b, but denied, with \nexplanation, SOR 2.a. (FORM, Item 1) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom she has \nworked since January 2017. She was married from October 1974 until divorcing in May \n1984, and she had two children, now adults, from that marriage. After receiving her high \nschool graduate equivalency degree in December 1979, Applicant joined the Air Force in \nJanuary 1980, where she served until retiring in January 2000. (FORM, Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant held a security clearance while in the Air Force. She also held a security \nclearance while working for a federal agency between November 2003 and March 2004, \nand while working as a defense contractor in Afghanistan between March 2005 and July \n2006. (FORM, Item 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAs she admitted in response to the SOR, Applicant used marijuana between 1975 \nand 2016. She used marijuana while serving on active duty in the military and while \npossessing security clearances for both government and federal contractor employment. \nIn a security clearance application submitted in July 2001, she did not disclose any prior \nuse of marijuana; however, in an August 2001 subject interview, Applicant stated that she \nhad used marijuana starting in 1975 and while serving in the Air Force. Applicant also has \nundergone treatment and counseling for mental health problems. Treatment records \nshow that she used marijuana at least in March 2010, July 2011, and September 2014. \nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP in January 2017, she stated that she only used \nmarijuana four to six times a year between April 2009 and November 2016, and that she \npurchased small amounts of marijuana in 2016 to use marijuana as a way to deal with \npersonal stress. In the same e-QIP, she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the e-QIP Section 23 question \nthat asked if she had ever used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. (FORM, \nItems 2 \u2013 7) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n\n \n4 \n \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \nThe security concern about illegal drug use is stated at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAvailable information in this case requires application of the following AG \u00b6 25 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 26 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nA plain reading of this record shows that there is no basis on which to apply any of \nthese mitigating conditions. Applicant has used marijuana with varying frequency for over \nforty years. She also used marijuana while being entrusted with access to sensitive \ninformation, despite clear proscriptions against such conduct. Finally, as discussed \nbelow, Applicant has an equally long history of willful obfuscation when asked to disclose \nthe adverse information about her drug involvement. Applicant did not submit any \ninformation to mitigate the security concerns raised under this guideline. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant willfully has made repeated false \nstatements to the government in response to questions about her use of illegal drugs. \nThe security concern raised by this conduct is stated at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified her 2017 e-QIP by failing to \ndisclose that she used marijuana while holding a security clearance. In support of her \ndenial of any intent to make a false statement to the government, Applicant pointed out \nthat she had, in fact, disclosed her use of marijuana in her e-QIP. However, that disclosure \n\n \n6 \n \nwas itself less than candid. The record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant \npreviously has made false statements about her drug use, which is far greater in scope \nthan what she listed in her 2017 e-QIP. All of the information probative of Applicant\u2019s \nintent when she submitted her e-QIP shows that she intended to mislead the Government \nabout her use of marijuana, and that Applicant did not mitigate the resulting security \nconcerns. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and H, I have reviewed the record before me in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). My review of all of the available \ninformation leaves unanswered the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information that were raised by her drug use and false statements. Because \nprotection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any \nremaining doubts must be resolved against the individual. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",
