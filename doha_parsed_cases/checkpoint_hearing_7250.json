Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 16, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D.\nAblard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nOn appeal, Applicant argues that his past actions were not acceptable, but that he is a\ndifferent person now.  As part of his argument, he summarizes the favorable evidence and provides\na detailed explanation about his prior conduct.   Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the\n2\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.

An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on December 20,\n2006. On March 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 5, 2008. He admitted all eight\nallegations in the SOR with explanation and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 4, 2008,\nand I received the case assignment on June 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non June 20, 2008, for a hearing on July 22, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government submitted four exhibits (Exh.) which were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted eight exhibits which were\nadmitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on July 30, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural Rulings\nAmendments to SOR\nThe government moved before the hearing to amend the SOR to change the\nmonth in the date in SOR \u00b6 1.h., and to add two additional allegations relating to\nfalsification of material facts on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.i.), and in statements to an\ninvestigator (SOR \u00b6 1.j.). Applicant filed an answer to the Amended SOR. He agreed to\nthe date correction and admitted the two additional allegations. The amendments were\nadopted without objection. \n    Findings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the ten allegations under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) in the SOR relating to arrests, traffic, omissions and\nother personal conduct issues.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a major government contractor working\nfor the past 18 months as support staff for information technology for the Department of\nHomeland Security. \nApplicant served in the Navy between 1996 and 2004 when he was medically\nseparated. The allegations in the SOR occurred over a 23 year period beginning with\nreceiving a ticket for driving without a license in his home town when he was 17-years-\nold (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). \nThe next allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., and 1.c.) relate to activity while Applicant was\non active duty in 1996-1997. During that period his wife shoplifted several times, both\nalone and with him, in private stores and with him at a Post Exchange where they were\narrested in August 1997. He was given non-judicial punishment under Article 81\n(conspiracy to shoplift) of the UCMJ. His punishment included a pay forfeiture, a\nsuspended reduction in paygrade, and 45 days of restriction and extra duty. His access\nto SCI was temporarily suspended but restored a month later at the request of his\ncommand. After filing for divorce in 2001, Applicant and his wife were divorced by a\ndecree dated January 11, 2002. He has never re-married. \n\n3\nIn August 2001, while stationed in Puerto Rico, Applicant was riding a motorcycle\nand had a head on collision with an automobile that ran in front of him. He suffered\nmultiple fractures, was hospitalized, and unable to work for a year of recovery (Exh. H).\nAfter his recovery in the summer of 2002 he joined a motorcycle club and participated in\nthrill riding such as driving in excess of 100 mph fleeing the police and eluding lawful\nstops. On one occasion he was stopped by police while driving without a license (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d., and 1.e.).\nIn November, 2003, around Thanksgiving, Applicant was stopped by a police\nofficer for speeding. During the police inquiry he provided false information to the officer\nby identifying himself with a false name since he knew he had a suspended license\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.). \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application in 2005 on which he denied\nat Question 32, relating to denial or suspension of a security clearance, that his security\nclearance had ever been suspended whereas it had been in 1997 as noted above (SOR\n\u00b6 1.g.). On January 18, 2006, the National Security Agency denied access to NSA SCI\nfor Applicant based on all of the above cited allegations (SOR \u00b6 1.h.). Subsequently,\nApplicant filed the SF 86 at issue in this proceeding and denied that access had ever\nbeen denied him at Question 26. On that application he did answer correctly concerning\nthe 1997 suspension (SOR \u00b6 1.i.). \nIn the course of the investigation for this matter, Applicant was interviewed on\nJuly 12, 2007, by an investigator and denied knowledge of his former wife\u2019s intent to\nshoplift during the 1996-1997 incidents for which he received non-judicial punishment\nfor conspiracy to shoplift (SOR \u00b6 1.j.).\nApplicant is well regarded for his honesty and trustworthiness by several friends\nand co-workers (Exhs. A-D). He is a successful contributor in his work and is regarded\nas a good collaborator and hard worker by his rater for the 2007 calendar year (Exh. E).\nApplicant\u2019s mother submitted a lengthy letter regarding his background and some of the\ndifficulties he and his family have had over the years (Exh. F). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG &\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b)\nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n5\nThe following disqualifying conditions (DC) in the guideline will normally\nresult in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative termination of\nfurther processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations. \n       Based on the evidence in the record, Applicant failed to provide full and frank\nanswers to certain critical questions on two SF 86s as noted in the first two DC\u2019s noted\nabove. His other conduct involving speeding, giving false information to the police, other\n\n6\ndriving offenses, and conspiracy to shoplift were insufficient to establish a basis for\nallegations under other guidelines, but do indicate a whole person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. .All of\nthese factors established a sufficient basis for a security concern under Guideline E.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nWhile most of the mitigating conditions are not applicable; several could be such\nas the passage of so much time since the earliest offenses and the fact that he no\nlonger is married to his former wife who appears to have initiated the shoplifting.\nHowever, he too, was deemed culpable yet continues to equivocate regarding his\nresponsibility. Security concerns pertaining to personal conduct are not mitigated.  \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant=s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual=s age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant has been involved in a variety of rule-breaking and rule-bending\nactionsfor many years. Some could be mitigated as in the distant past but even some of\nthose continue to complicate his life as he seems to want to change the story as to how\nthey occurred. He has not made wise choices as particularly illustrated by his\nmotorcycle racing only one year after a near fatal accident. His actions with regard to\nhis SF 86's in 2005 and 2006 show a cavalier attitude about carefulness in reporting\nproblems he has had in his life. That is not to say that he is a security risk or likely to\ncompromise classified information, but those actions are sufficiently recent as to\nconvince me that it is premature to grant him a clearance at this time. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from these personal\nconduct allegations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.f.:  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:  Against Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied.\n_____________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 27-year-old man who works for a federal contractor. He graduated from high school in 1998. He is the father of two young daughters. He denies the judgment listed in SOR 1.a. This debt is for unpaid parking tickets that Applicant claims were issued to a car that he sold. He stated the car was still in his name, but he did not own it any longer. Applicant failed to provide any documentary evidence to support his denial.1 Applicant stated that he paid the debt listed in SOR 1.b on August 28, 2008.2 The debt was for unpaid rent from October 2005. He stated the reason he did not pay it when it was due was because he did not have the money. He did not have documentary evidence to substantiate his position.3 Applicant incurred the debt in SOR 1.c in April 2002. It is a bill for cable services that had not been paid. He stated he could not pay it at the time because he did not make enough money.4 Applicant has owed the debt in SOR 1.d since 2002 for electric services.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 30, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 7, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 11, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on September 4, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n5, and they were admitted without objections. Applicant testified and did not submit any \nexhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 11, 2008  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old man who works for a federal contractor. He graduated \nfrom high school in 1998. He is the father of two young daughters. He denies the \njudgment listed in SOR 1.a. This debt is for unpaid parking tickets that Applicant claims \nwere issued to a car that he sold. He stated the car was still in his name, but he did not \nown it any longer. Applicant failed to provide any documentary evidence to support his \ndenial.1 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he paid the debt listed in SOR 1.b on August 28, 2008.2 The \ndebt was for unpaid rent from October 2005. He stated the reason he did not pay it \nwhen it was due was because he did not have the money. He did not have documentary \nevidence to substantiate his position.3 \n \n \nApplicant incurred the debt in SOR 1.c in April 2002. It is a bill for cable services \nthat had not been paid. He stated he could not pay it at the time because he did not \nmake enough money.4 \n \n \nApplicant has owed the debt in SOR 1.d since 2002 for electric services. He \nattempted to make a payment arrangement with the creditor when he contacted them \napproximately one to two years ago. The creditor would not set up a payment schedule \nand wanted the payment in full. This debt remains delinquent.5 \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.e is for cable services that has been due since August \n2003.6 It remains delinquent.7 \n \n \n1 Tr. 22-26; GE 4. \n \n2 Tr. 20; GE 1, page 9. \n \n3 Tr. 26-29. \n \n4 Tr. 29-30; GE 1 page 11. \n \n5 Tr. 31-33. \n \n6 GE 2, page 10. \n \n7 Tr. 33-34; GE 1 page 10 \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.f is for child support. Applicant stated he resolved the \ndelinquency with the mother of his daughters. He is obligated to pay $700 a month. He \nstated that the mother apparently stated she did not want child support and then \nchanged her mind and went to court to receive it. He stated the case was mediated and \nit was decided he did not have to pay through the state system. Applicant claims he is \nnot in arrears and does not owe child support, but failed to provide any documentary \nevidence to support his position. His credit report lists the debt and he also listed it on \nhis security clearance application as a delinquent debt.8  \n \n \nApplicant has not paid the debt listed in SOR 1.g. This debt is with a collection \nagency. Applicant did not recognize the debt, but did not research the original creditor.9 \n \n \nApplicant stated he did not recognize the debt listed in SOR 1.h. He listed this \ndebt on his SCA, but denied it on his answer to the SOR. At his hearing he stated he did \nnot know what the debt was for. He has not paid the debt or disputed it with supporting \ndocuments.10  \n \n \nApplicant has not paid the debts in SOR 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n. Some of them \nhe denies he knows who the creditors are, but has not disputed the debts or attempted \nto resolve. Others he admits he owes, but has not paid. Others he admits he owes the \ndebt, but disputes the amount, but has not contacted the creditors to dispute the debt.11 \n \n \nApplicant stated he has a net monthly salary of $3,200. After he pays his \nexpenses and child support, he estimated he has approximately $1,000. He stated that \nin addition to his child support of $700 for his daughters, he spends approximately \nanother $350 on them each month, buying clothes and other items.12  \n \n \nApplicant has been working for the past ten years and was unemployed about a \nyear and a half ago for a period of three to four months. During that time he could not \nafford to pay his bills. He is trying to pay his bills, but does not have a budget and \nadmitted he spends money on \u201cstupid stuff.\u201d He admitted he never learned how to save \nmoney, but he is doing the best he can. He has not had financial counseling. Applicant \nis trying to pay his debts \u201cstep by step\u201d and needs time to pay off his bills.13  \n \n \n \n \n \n8 Tr. 20-22, 34-59; GE 1 and 5. \n \n9 Tr. 61-65; GE 3. \n \n10 Tr. 65-70; GE 1, page 10. \n \n11 Tr. 71-72. \n \n12 Tr. 72-83. \n \n13 Tr. 84-88. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has \nmany debts that have been delinquent for a long period and they remain unpaid. \nApplicant has been unable and unwilling to pay his delinquent debts. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe individual has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. He does not have a budget or a realistic plan for resolving his debts. Applicant \nhad a period of unemployment, but also admitted that he does not really budget his \nexcess income and spends it on \u201cstupid stuff.\u201d In find (a) does not apply. In order for (b) \nto apply Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. I cannot find \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. He does not have a plan to \nresolve his debts and he spends his excess income frivolously. Therefore, I find (b) \ndoes not apply. Applicant offered no evidence that he received financial counseling or \nthat there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or under control. He failed \nto provide evidence he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve his debts. I find (c) and (d) do not apply. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant appears to be a hard \nworker and sincere in wanting to better his predicament and pay his delinquent debts, \nbut he has not taken a proactive approach to doing so. He needs to set up a budget and \nseek financial counseling so he can better understand how to manage his money. Until \nthen his cycle of frustration will likely continue. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations concerning drug involvement, and criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his responses to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 3 and 4), are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant is a 42-year-old blaster/painter employed by a defense contractor. He has worked for his present employer since April 2006. He has rapidly qualified to perform many certified technical functions, and has been a \u201cstellar employee,\u201d according to his project manager and supervisor. (AE A through J; Tr. at 73-75.) He has never held a security clearance. On his e-QIP, Applicant admitted to using marijuana and crack cocaine more than 50 times each between January 1997 and February 2006. (GE 1 at \u00a7 24.)

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine regularly from 1997 to 2006. He also sold\nboth drugs, experimented with others, and was convicted of drug possession twice\nduring that period. He has abstained from drug use since entering inpatient\nrehabilitation in February 2006. He has changed his lifestyle, has an excellent work\nrecord for 30 months, and is committed to continued abstinence. Applicant is making\nsignificant progress but, given his long history of criminal substance abuse, insufficient\ntime has passed to demonstrate permanent behavioral change. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on March 27, 2007. On May 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines H, and J. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nNovember 17, 2008\n\n2\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 8, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on August 11, 2008. On August 25, 2008, Applicant indicated that he\ndesired to have a hearing during a telephone conversation with Department Counsel,\nand that he would send a fax to document that request. The next day, Department\nCounsel indicated that he also desired a hearing and would so request pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.7. On August 27, 2008, Applicant submitted the fax requesting a\nhearing before an administrative judge. (Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II.) Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on September 2, 2008, and the case was assigned to\nme on the following day. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 3, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on September 25, 2008. The Government offered\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. The Government also\noffered HE IV, comprising two sections of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and\none section of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, to support a request that I\ntake administrative notice of the facts that marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), and\nmethamphetamine are controlled substances. Applicant had no objection, and\nadministrative notice was taken of these facts. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and\nsubmitted exhibits (AE) A through I, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisor also testified for him. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open\nuntil October 17, 2008, to permit him to obtain and submit additional evidence. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 2, 2008. On October 13, 2008,\nApplicant submitted the additional evidence to Department Counsel, who forwarded it\nwithout objection to its consideration on October 15, 2008. This evidence was admitted,\nmarked AE J, and the record was closed. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations\nconcerning drug involvement, and criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including\nthose contained in his responses to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 3 and 4), are\nincorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant is a 42-year-old blaster/painter employed by a defense contractor. He\nhas worked for his present employer since April 2006. He has rapidly qualified to\nperform many certified technical functions, and has been a \u201cstellar employee,\u201d\naccording to his project manager and supervisor. (AE A through J; Tr. at 73-75.) He has\nnever held a security clearance.\nOn his e-QIP, Applicant admitted to using marijuana and crack cocaine more\nthan 50 times each between January 1997 and February 2006. (GE 1 at \u00a7 24.) He later\ndescribed his use as twice per month, using both drugs together during this period. (GE\n3 at 2; Tr. at 49.) This computes to be more than 200 uses over that nine year period. In\n\n3\nJuly 2005, Applicant was diagnosed to be Cannabis dependent, in remission. (GE 4 at\n5.) \nApplicant was arrested for possession of marijuana on February 17, 2001, was\nconvicted after pleading guilty, and was sentenced to serve one day in jail, pay a fine,\nand undergo a drug evaluation. He failed to undergo that drug evaluation before being\narrested again and charged with felony methamphetamine possession, contempt of\ncourt, and driving without a license on June 6, 2005. He then obtained a drug\nevaluation, so the contempt of court charge was dropped. He pled guilty to\nmethamphetamine possession and was sentenced to 14 days in jail, a fine, and 12\nmonths probation including drug treatment. (GE 1 at \u00a7 23; GE 2 at 2-3.) He stated\nduring the hearing that the methamphetamine belonged to his cousin, but he pled guilty\nbecause he did not want to turn his cousin in. (Tr. at 57-58, 88-89.)\nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR and during his hearing that he used\necstasy (MDMA) twice, and used methamphetamine once, all prior to February 2006.\nDuring the same 1997 to 2006 period, he admitted to selling marijuana and cocaine on\nmultiple occasions to obtain funds to pay bills and support his drug habit. He also\nadmitted testing positive for marijuana and cocaine in January 2006 in connection with\nadmission to the court-ordered drug treatment program. (Answer to SOR; Tr. at 54-57.)\nI took administrative notice that marijuana, cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine are\nall controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act.\nApplicant successfully completed a 28-day intensive inpatient detoxification and\ndrug treatment program on March 20, 2006. (GE 4 at 4; Tr. at 49-52, 56.) He then\nsuccessfully completed his outpatient aftercare program on October 13, 2008. (AE K at\n4; Tr. at 51-52.) He signed a statement of intent not to abuse any drugs in the future\nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. (AE K at 5.) He is subject to\nrandom drug testing at least once a year, and anytime based on suspicion of\nimpairment or during an incident investigation by his employer. (Tr. at 73, 75.) He has\nended all contact with former drug-involved associates, and dedicated himself to\nproviding a good example for his children and involvement in his church. (Tr. at 59-60,\n62, 69-71.) Applicant testified openly and honestly about his past drug abuse, and\nconvincingly declared his intent never to abuse drugs in the future. His supervisor, the\nregional project manager, was a no-nonsense and highly credible witness, who knows\nabout his past, monitors him closely, will tolerate no relapses, and vouched strongly for\nhis rehabilitation, present trustworthiness and reliability.   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of\nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions raised by the SOR allegations and asserted by\nDepartment Counsel are: \u201c(a) any drug abuse;\u201d \u201c(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\u201d\n\n5\nand \u201c(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\nApplicant admitted long-term regular use of marijuana and crack cocaine over a\nnine-year period ending in February 2006. He tested positive for both substances in\nJanuary 2006. He also admitted experimental use of MDMA and methamphetamine. He\nwas arrested for, and convicted of, criminal possession of drugs in 2001 and 2005, and\nadmitted selling drugs that he possessed on multiple other occasions during this period.\nThis conduct squarely raises substantial security concerns under the foregoing AG\nprovisions. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Mitigating\nconditions raised by this record include: \u201c(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d \u201c(b)\na demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, (4) a signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation;\u201d and \u201c(d)\nsatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited\nto rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use occurred over at least nine years, and as\nrecently as February 2006. While he has abstained for two and a half years, he was\ndiagnosed with Cannabis dependence in remission. His efforts to date are highly\ncommendable, but balanced against the length and frequency of his drug abuse, it is\npremature to conclude that it is unlikely to recur and no longer casts doubt on his\njudgment and reliability (\u00b6 26(a)). Applicant provided substantial evidence of intent not\nto abuse drugs in the future, including his statement that he has disassociated from\ndrug-using contacts, his abstinence since his inpatient treatment, and his signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation (\u00b6 16(b)). As noted above, however, the\nperiod of abstinence is insufficient at this point to fully mitigate security concerns.\nFinally, he provided proof of successful completion of inpatient intensive treatment and\noutpatient aftercare programs, but provided no prognosis by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional (\u00b6 26(d)). \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions asserted by the Government were:\n\u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\n\n6\nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d The crimes alleged in the SOR include Applicant\u2019s arrests for,\nand convictions of drug possession in 2001 and 2005, the latter of which was charged\nas a felony. Applicant pled guilty to and admitted to commission of both offenses.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Applicant\u2019s\nrecent abstinence, completion of inpatient and outpatient treatment programs, good\nwork performance, and lifestyle changes create some mitigation under two of them.\nThese are: \u201c(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and, \u201c(d)\nthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of\ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nFor mitigation analysis, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed criminal conduct and his criminal\nhistory must be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. In addition to his two\nconvictions, Applicant admitted to multiple drug sales and regular illegal use of drugs\nbetween 1997 and 2006. All of these crimes involved illegal substance abuse, and were\nindicative of poor judgment and a lack of  self-control, as well as a willingness to flaunt\nrules and regulations. Given the length and frequency of this conduct up until February\n2006, Applicant did not establish strong mitigation of the concerns arising from his\ncriminal history. His recent outstanding employment record, job training, treatment\nprogram successes, and period of abstinence from drug involvement are evidence that\nsupport successful rehabilitation. The length and frequency of his former criminal\nactivity, however, lead to the conclusion that on balance it is still too soon to be\nconfident that such behavior is unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his\nreliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involved a pattern of recurring drug-abuse related offenses. He successfully\ncompleted inpatient and outpatient drug treatment programs. All offenses and drug\nabuse of concern occurred when he was mature and fully responsible for his choices.\nHe voluntarily participated in drug abuse on a regular basis for over nine years. At this\npoint, he has abstained for two and a half years, which is a good start toward\ndemonstrating that such conduct will not recur.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured to commit any offense by\nanything beyond normal life pressures to which he remains subject. He has made\npositive lifestyle changes, and gained a positive influence in his recent employment by a\nvery supportive supervisor. His behavior and good work performance since February\n2006 create an excellent beginning in establishing a record of more responsible and\ntrustworthy conduct, and provide a sound basis on which to build eligibility for a security\nclearance in the near future. The quantity and recency of drug abuse and criminal acts,\nhowever, preclude a present judgment that Applicant has met his burden of mitigating\nthe security concerns raised by the undisputed evidence in this record. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with sufficient doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance that I must conclude he has not\nmet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising from drug involvement and\ncriminal conduct considerations. His successful continuation of abstinence from drug\nabuse or other criminal activity and outstanding work performance should support a\nmore favorable conclusion in the relatively near future.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 22, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 26, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 7, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant has two delinquent, charged off debts with CAP 1 Bank in the\napproximate amounts of $744.00 and $1,521.00.\nApplicant is indebted to Palisades in the approximate amount of $1,327.00. This\nis a collection account that HSBC NV sold or transferred to Palisades.\nApplicant is indebted to Palisades in the approximate amount of $2,848.00. This\nis a collection account that WAMU/PROVIDIAN sold or transferred to Palisades.\nApplicant is indebted to Palisades in the approximate amount of $735.00. This is\na collection account that AT&T sold or transferred to Palisades.\nApplicant is indebted to Capital 1 FA in the approximate amount of $11,899.00.\nThis debt was placed for collection.\nThe SOR alleges, and applicant denies, that he has six debts with USA Funds\ntotaling approximately $22,348.00. Exhibit 5 establishes that the six debts originated\nwith JP MORGAN CHASE as student loans, all six went delinquent, and all six were\ntransferred to USA Funds for collection. On a January 2007 security questionnaire (e-\nQIP), applicant indicated he is indebted to Pioneer Credit Recovery in the amount of\n$23,000.00 for student loans (which originated with Salliemae), and these debts are\npast-due. Based on the similar debt amounts and similar numbers for the accounts\nlisted on both credit reports (Exhibits 5 and 6), it appears these are the same debts. I\ntherefore find that applicant has approximately $22,348.00 in delinquent student loan\ndebt. On the same e-QIP, applicant stated his debt \u201cis set for direct reimbursement\nthrough the checking account currently and will once again be in good standing with\nSalliemae in February.\u201d Although he had the opportunity to do so, applicant provided no\nevidence that he followed through and made any payments on his student loan debts.\nApplicant is indebted to Ford Motor Company in the approximate amount of\n$7,092.00. This debt represents the difference in value between applicant\u2019s\nrepossessed vehicle and what he still owed on the vehicle loan at the time of\nrepossession. The debt was placed for collection. According to information applicant\nprovided on his January 2007 e-QIP, the debt went to judgment. Applicant stated on the\ne-QIP that he is working with a law firm to \u201cpay back the remaining balance.\u201d Although\nhe had the opportunity to do so, he provided no evidence that he has made any\npayments to Ford.\nApplicant is indebted to Safeway as a result of a returned check in the\napproximate amount of $194.00.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\n\n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability or\nunwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s numerous delinquent\ndebts are still outstanding. He provided no explanation for them. There is no basis to\nconclude debts he incurs in the future will not be ignored. Accordingly, this mitigation\ncondition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\npresented no evidence that would indicate his inability or unwillingness to pay his debts\nwas caused by conditions largely beyond his control. Accordingly, this mitigating\ncondition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant stated\non his e-QIP that he is working with a law firm to satisfy his Ford debt, and has made\narrangements to repay his delinquent student loan debt. Despite at least two\nopportunities to do so (i.e., in response to the SOR and in response to the FORM),\napplicant offered no evidence that he has paid anything to Ford or to the creditor\nholding his student loan debt. But even if he had, in the context of his overall past-due\nindebtedness, this would not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. This\nmitigating condition does not apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n\n5\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations. Because he offered no explanation for\nhis financial irresponsibility, there is no basis to conclude it will not continue. Based on\nthe foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On December 21, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 3, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Applicant also requests that the Board reopen\nthe record for the submission of additional documentation.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 43-year-old employee\nof a federal contractor.  She has been married twice.  The first marriage ended in divorce in 1999.\nShe remarried in 2002.  She has two adult sons from her first marriage and four adult stepsons from\nher second.  \nApplicant has about $50,000 in delinquent debt, which includes collection accounts, charged-\noff accounts, and two unpaid judgements.  In 2002 she changed employers, resulting in loss of pay\nand benefits.  Her current salary is $11.00 an hour.  Her husband experienced a period of\nunemployment from March to September 2007.  Applicant traces her financial problems to 1999,\nwhen she divorced.  At that time she accepted several credit card offers.  \u201cAlthough she claimed to\nhave paid some of the debts, she did not present any documentary evidence showing that she has\npaid in full, settled, or resolved any of the debts in the SOR.\u201d  Decision at 3.\nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are supported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) \nThe Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found and his ultimate adverse\nsecurity clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 21, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJuly 3, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received on February 12, 2008, and she\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on June 5, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 16,\n2008.\nProcedural Rulings \nOn the government\u2019s motion, the SOR was amended to delete the allegation in \u00b6\n1.j because it erroneously duplicated the allegation in \u00b6 1.i. Applicant had no objections,\nand the motion was granted.   \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the amended SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts ranging from\n$137 to $9,070 for about $50,000 in total. The delinquent debts include collection\naccounts, charged-off accounts, and two unpaid judgments. Her Answer was mixed.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She worked for a\nfederal contractor from 1986 to 2002. She started working in production, but changed to\na security officer position in 1991 or 1992. In 2002, the security function was sold off to\na security company, and Applicant became an employee of that company with the same\nduties at the same location. In short, she has been continuously employed in the\ndefense industry since 1986. \nShe is now seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to her. To\nthat end, she completed a security-clearance application in February 2007 (Exhibit 1). In\nresponse to questions about her financial record, she disclosed wage garnishments in\n2004 and 2005 as well as delinquent credit card accounts. \nApplicant has married twice. Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1999. That\nmarriage produced two sons who are now young adults living on their own. She\nremarried in 2002, and she now has four adult stepsons. A 19-year-old stepson is living\nwith Applicant and her husband.\n\n It is assumed the three debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d are one debt because it involves the same\n3\ncreditor and Applicant recalls having only one credit card account with this company. \n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n4\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n3\nApplicant\u2019s change of employers in 2002 resulted in a loss of pay and benefits.\nFor example, she went from earning $11.75 per hour to $9.50 per hour. Her wage is\nnow $11.00 per hour. In March 2007, her husband was laid off from his job with a state\nhighway department (Tr. 38\u201340). He was unemployed until about September 2007\nwhen he accepted a part-time position. He now has a full-time position and benefits\nworking for a maintenance department of a local college.\n  \nApplicant traces her financial problems to 1999 when she divorced and accepted\nseveral credit card offers (Tr. 21\u201322, 43\u201344). Her history of financial problems is well\ndocumented (Exhibits 1\u20133). For example, a February 2007 credit report contains two\nunpaid judgments for $4,000 and $3,663, multiple accounts with derogatory information\n(e.g., past due, bad debt, assigned for collection), and six accounts in the collections\nsection of the report (Exhibit 2). The delinquent debts in the SOR are established by\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, her testimony, and the credit reports.  Although she claimed to\n3\nhave paid some of the debts, she did not present any documentary evidence showing\nthat she has paid in full, settled, or resolved any of the debts in the SOR.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.4\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n6\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n7\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n15\nconditions under Guideline F). \n4\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n8\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n9\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n10\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n11\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.12\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n14\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n15\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n5\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n16\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n17\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n18\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. It appears Applicant was\nfinancially irresponsible when she used credit cards to make purchases she could not\nafford and otherwise lived beyond her means. Her delinquent debts are both\nlongstanding and ongoing. \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and,\nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \n\n6\nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. In particular, MC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person's\ncontrol\u2014has some potential application. Applicant\u2019s divorce in 1999, the change of\nemployers in 2002, and her husband\u2019s brief unemployment no doubt affected her overall\nfinancial condition and these matters were largely beyond her control. But she did not\nact responsibly under the circumstances when she used credit cards in an irresponsible\nmanner.  \nAnother potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. She has done\nlittle to demonstrate an intent to clean up her financial house. Although she claims to\nmade payments or paid some of the debts, she has not presented any reliable\ndocumentary information to establish her claims. Based on this record, her efforts are\nnot enough to qualify as a good-faith effort. Indeed, what is missing here is: (1) a\nrealistic and workable plan; (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the plan;\nand (3) a measurable improvement to the situation. In simple terms, she did not present\nsufficient evidence to establish her case. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nDeleted \nSubparagraphs 1.k\u20131.n:\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since February 2006. He was born in Australia and graduated from college there. He came to the U.S. in 1985 on a work visa and obtained a green card in 1988. He has resided in the U.S. since 1985. In 1991 he earned a master\u2019s degree from an American university. He married a U.S. citizen in 1996 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. He explained the reason it took so long was because at the time the waiting period was between eight and ten years.2 Shortly after becoming a U.S. citizen he obtained a U.S. passport. He retained his active Australian passport and used it to travel to Australia in 2006. He used his Australian passport \u201cbecause I could pass quicker as an Australian. Because I am a citizen, yeah.\u201d3 Applicant has a bank account in Australia that he maintained since 1985. He had at one time approximately $22,000 U.S. dollars in it for his niece and nephew\u2019s educational expenses. This money was revenue from an apartment he owned there and sold in 2004. He has since transferred the money for educational expenses for his niece and nephew and the account has about a $15 balance. He paid both Australian and U.S. taxes on his investment property.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 15, 2007, admitted all of the \nallegations, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was \nassigned to me on July 18, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 25, 2008, \nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 21, 2008.

Applicant testified \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nand submitted Exhibit (AE) A through BB. Department Counsel objected to all of the \ndocuments except B, L, N, Q, Y, AA and BB on the basis of relevance.1 I overruled the \nobjection and the documents were admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 27, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since February \n2006. He was born in Australia and graduated from college there. He came to the U.S. \nin 1985 on a work visa and obtained a green card in 1988. He has resided in the U.S. \nsince 1985. In 1991 he earned a master\u2019s degree from an American university. He \nmarried a U.S. citizen in 1996 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. He \nexplained the reason it took so long was because at the time the waiting period was \nbetween eight and ten years.2 Shortly after becoming a U.S. citizen he obtained a U.S. \npassport. He retained his active Australian passport and used it to travel to Australia in \n2006. He used his Australian passport \u201cbecause I could pass quicker as an Australian. \nBecause I am a citizen, yeah.\u201d3 \n \n \nApplicant has a bank account in Australia that he maintained since 1985. He had \nat one time approximately $22,000 U.S. dollars in it for his niece and nephew\u2019s \neducational expenses. This money was revenue from an apartment he owned there and \nsold in 2004. He has since transferred the money for educational expenses for his niece \nand nephew and the account has about a $15 balance. He paid both Australian and \nU.S. taxes on his investment property. He has no other assets located in Australia. He \nhas approximately $1 million in assets in the U.S.4 \n \n \nApplicant is entitled to a pension in Australia because of his employment while he \nlived there. He would receive this pension regardless of what his citizenship status is \nand whether he retires in the U.S. or Australia. It might be subject to a means test. He \nwould also be entitled to U.S. social security. Although the Australian pension is not \ncontingent on his location, Applicant wants to keep his Australian citizenship just in case \nthere is an issue. He did not anticipate this would be an issue until the distant future. He \nconsiders the Australian pension as \u201cpurely a safety net for myself and my wife.\u201d He \nstated \u201cmy concern with the pension has always been really to take [care of] my wife so \n \n1 Many of the documents presented by Applicant were press releases, joint communiqu\u00e9s and \nother articles. I considered all of the documents Applicant presented and gave it the appropriate weight in \naccordance with the factual issues important to the case. \n \n2 Tr. 40-45. \n \n3 Tr. 37-38. \n \n4 Tr. 41-44, 55, 58. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nthat she could return to Australia. I always thought that I would only ever be eligible for \nan Australian pension if I returned to Australia, which I don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d He \nwent on to say that the reason for retaining his Australian citizenship was \u201csentimental \nreasons.\u201d5 \n \n \nApplicant considers himself a dual citizen of Australia and the United States. He \nacknowledged he took an oath of allegiance to the U.S. when he became a citizen. He \nstated he takes that oath seriously and he accepts his obligation to the U.S. above all \nothers. He also read the oath that says he renounced and abjure absolutely and entirely \nall allegiance to any foreign principal, state, or sovereign, to which he was a subject or \ncitizen. Applicant went on to explain \u201cMy point is that this actually shows that I am \nprimarily a U.S. citizen, even though I was born in Australia.\u201d6 Applicant then clearly \nstated he is not willing to renounce his Australian citizenship.7 He uses his Australian \npassport to enter and exit Australia. This is a requirement for Australian citizens. He \nstated: \u201cRegarding the Australian passport, I\u2019m actually required; I cannot have my \npassport destroyed because the Australian government requires that I must have a \npassport when in Australia. As an Australian citizen, I can not have a strange passport, I \ncannot use a U.S. passport when in Australia, and I cannot obtain a visa to Australia.\u201d8 \nWhen questioned, Applicant admitted that the reason he has to use his Australian \npassport is because he claims citizenship there. If he was not claiming Australian \ncitizenship, he would be permitted to use his American passport.9 He went on to say \u201cI \nwant to keep my dual citizenship, yes.\u201d10 \n \n \nIn answering interrogatories Applicant stated he was willing to perform military \nservice or bear arms for Australia.11 He believes he must abide by the Australian laws \nand if they were to go to war and he was required to serve in the military he would do as \nrequired because he is a citizen of Australia. If fighting a war is a requirement of his \nAustralian citizenship then he will abide by the requirement because of his citizenship \nstatus. He believes this is consistent with his U.S. citizen status because the two \ncountries are allies. In the unlikelihood he would have to choose between Australia and \n \n5 Tr. 36-37, 48-53; AE R. \n \n6 Tr.29-30. \n \n7 Tr. 30-31. \n \n8 Tr. 31. \n \n9 Tr. 32.  \n \n10 Tr. 35. \n \n11 GE 2, question 26, Tr. 56. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe U.S. his response was \u201cI would probably have to bear arms for the U.S.\u201d12 Appellant \nunderstands that he does not have to be a dual citizen, but that he chooses to be.13 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Australia in 2006 for three months as a requirement of his \njob. He used his Australian passport to enter and exit the country. He used his U.S. \npassport to exit the U.S. and return. Although he does not have any current plans to \nvisit Australian he can not rule it out. Applicant has surrendered his Australian passport \nto his security manager. He stated it can not be destroyed because as a dual citizen he \nwill need it to gain entry into Australia.14 Therefore, he will retain it and use it for any \ntrips he may take to Australia in the future. When Applicant travels any place outside the \nU.S. except Australia, he uses his U.S. passport. Applicant has made up his mind and \ndoes not intend on retiring to Australia.  \n \n \nApplicant has not voted in Australia since 1999. He has voted in all elections and \nprimaries in the U.S. since becoming a citizen.15 Applicant considers himself an \nAustralian citizen and bound by its laws.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n12 Tr. 56-59. \n \n13 Tr. 60. \n \n14 Tr. 35-36. \n \n15 Tr.55. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: When an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered AG \u00b6 10 (a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport; (2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry\u2026 (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country\u201d) and (b) (\u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship \nby an American citizen.\u201d) Applicant maintains an active Australian passport and uses it \nwhen he travels there. He considers himself a dual citizen and acknowledges he is \nbound by Australian laws. Applicant continued to use his Australian passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. He acknowledges that if he did not consider himself an \nAustralian citizen and renounced that status, he would be permitted to enter Australia \n\n \n6 \n \n \non his U.S. passport. Instead because he maintains his citizenship with Australia he \nmust comply with the entry and exit laws and all other laws. Applicant admitted that as \nan Australian citizen if he was required to serve in the Australian military he would do \nso. Finally, although he stated that he does not have to be a citizen of Australia to \ncollect certain pension rights, he wants to ensure he maintains his citizenship as a \nsafety net for his pension. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 and especially \nconsidered (a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship\u201d) and (e) (\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d) Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not based \nsolely on his birth in Australia. Although he was born in Australia, since he became a \nU.S. citizen he used his Australian passport and has exercised his rights and obligations \nas an Australian citizen. He has exercised his Australian citizenship by choice, thereby \nnegating the application of (a). Applicant is not willing to renounce his Australian \ncitizenship, and has made a conscious decision not to because he wants to maintain \nany rights he may have in that country. Hence, I find (b) does not apply. Applicant has \nsurrendered his passport to the cognizant security authority. His actions have met the \nspecific language of the mitigating condition, but not the spirit of it because he intends to \nretrieve the passport when he travels to Australia. Again, as an Australian citizen he is \nrequired to enter and exit the country on that passport. So although (e) applies, it is not \nenough to overcome the other facts of his Australian citizenship status because his \nsurrender is conditioned upon it being returned to him when he wants to travel to \nAustralia.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen who wants to retain his dual citizenship status with Australia. He has used his \nAustralian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen to enter and exit that country because \n\n \n7 \n \n \nit is required of its citizens by Australia. Applicant is unwilling to renounce his citizenship \nwith Australia and does not want to affect any potential rights he may have there. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from Foreign Preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligations dating back to \nat least 2001. Apart from making payments on three debts, Applicant\u2019s indebtedness for \nher remaining 23 debts exceeding $24,000 remains unpaid. At the time of her hearing, \nshe was unemployed and was living off her savings, which she said consisted of about \n$2,000. She does not have a plan to resolve her indebtedness apart from seeking a job \nand began paying her bills as she is able.  \n \nThe Government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \npresented a prima facie case. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties remain ongoing. Financial \nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; apply in \nthis case.  \n \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude that Applicant is able to \nreceive partial credit under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC \u00b6 \n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; for her uncovered medical expenses related to her diabetes.  \n \nHowever, whatever credit she received by this MC is overcome by her financial \nmismanagement for the last several years. Applicant presented minimal or no evidence \ndocumenting efforts taken to contact or resolve debts with her unpaid creditors.   \n \nShe presented no evidence to show she has dealt responsibly with her financial \nobligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, credible payment plans). Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack \nof favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility, or that she has taken control of her financial situation. Based on \nher past performance, any prospective assurances ring hollow. Her financial problems \nare likely to be a concern in the future. Moreover, her financial problems are recent, not \nisolated, and ongoing.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s situation is most unfortunate, overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from her financial difficulties.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g. \u2013 1.i.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j. \u2013 1.z.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n2  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on October 2, 2006. On November 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 10, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n24, 2008. The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on January 25, 2008. \nThe case was transferred to me on February 26, 2008. On March 13, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 16, 2008. The hearing was held, as \nscheduled. The Government offered four exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1-4 without objection. The Applicant offered seven exhibits which were \nMay 21,2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-G without objection. Applicant and his fianc\u00e9  \ntestified at the hearing. The record was held open until April 30, 2008, to allow Applicant \nto submit additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted a seven page document which \nwas admitted as AE H without objection. The transcript was received on April 24, 2008. \nThe record closed on April 30, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nOn January 24, 2008, the Government submitted a motion to amend the SOR.  \nThe motion to amend consisted of clarifications to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l.  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j were withdrawn.  A new allegation under Guideline E, Personal \nConduct, SOR \u00b6 2.a was added. At the start of the hearing the motion to amend was \ngranted with no objections from Applicant. (Tr at 15.) The amendments to the SOR are \nattached to the original SOR. The SOR was also amended to reflect Applicant\u2019s first \nname. Applicant had his name legally changed on July 25, 2007. (Tr at 5; AE G.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, \n1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k.  He denies the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.l, 1.m, and \n2.a.  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his current employer for the past three \nyears as a computer operator. (Tr at 6-7) He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force \nfrom April 21, 1993, to April 25, 2005. He separated with an honorable discharge at the \nrank of Senior Airman (E-4). (AE C.) He held a security clearance for 12 years while on \nactive duty in the Air Force.  He has a high school education. He is engaged to be \nmarried.  He and his fianc\u00e9 have an eight-month-old son. He has a 12-year-old son from \na prior marriage who currently resides with him. He also has a 12-year-old daughter \nfrom a prior relationship. His daughter lives with her mother who is on active duty in the \nmilitary. (Tr at 6, 46-48; Gov 1.)   \n \nOn October 2, 2006, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). He answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 \nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He also answered, \n\u201cNo\u201d in response to question 28(b) \u201cAre you currently 90 day(s) delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed Applicant had the following  \ndelinquent accounts:   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: a $285 account placed for collection in October 2001 (Gov 2 at 16-\n17; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 2; AE B at 3);  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: a $1,390 account placed for collection in January 2004 (Gov 2 at 11 \nGov 3 at 3-4; Gov 4 at 4; AE B at 3-4);  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: a $4,326 delinquent Air Force Club account placed for collection in \nApril 2001 (Gov 2 at 12, 15; Gov 3 at 3);  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: a $4,449 delinquent collection account placed for collection in \nFebruary 2004 (Gov 2 at 13; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 4; AE B at 4.);  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: a $1,336 delinquent collection account placed for collection in May \n2005 (Gov 2 at 4, 16; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 4; AE B at 2); \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: a $921 credit card account charged off in September 2002 (Gov 3 at \n2; Gov 4 at 3.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: a $1,163 department store account, charged off in January 2004 \n(Gov 2 at 6, 13; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; AE B at 2.);  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: a $798 delinquent account charged off in October 2002 (Gov 3 at 2; \nGov 4 at 3; AE B at 3.); \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: an $823 credit card account placed for collection in May 2001 (Gov 2 \nat 4.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: an $823 account placed for collection in May 2001.  This is a  \nduplicate entry of SOR \u00b6 1.i. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: a $1,067 delinquent account placed for collection in January 2002 \n(Gov 2 at 7; AE B at 3.);   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: a $223 delinquent dental bill placed for collection in November 2002 \n(Gov 2 at 8, 16; Gov 4 at 2; AE B at 3.); \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: a $158 delinquent cell phone account placed for collection in \nDecember 2002 (Gov 2 at 16; AE B at 2.). \n \nApplicant claims that he began to encounter financial problems between 1995 \nand 1997 as a result of poor financial decisions when he was younger. He charged too \nmuch on his credit cards and was unable to pay the bills. He was not earning much \nmoney and had two young children to support.  He also went through a divorce in May \n2001.  He states that for the past two years he has paid his current bills on time. (Tr at \n34, 40-41, 47, 59, 74; Gov 1, section 13/15.)  \n  \nApplicant paid off the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k in November 2005. (Tr at 36; AE \nA.)  He disputes the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l because he claims it is a dental bill for \nhis 12-year-old daughter which should be covered by her active duty mother\u2019s military \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhealth benefits. (Tr at 36.) He admits all of the debts are his. He disputes the balance \nowed on the debts. (Tr at 49.) He is willing to resolve his remaining delinquent debts. He \nhas not made any attempts to resolve the remaining delinquent accounts because he \ndid not have the money to offer settlements. (Tr at 44-45, 49-50.)  \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g are the same account. Note the same \naccount number.  The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was sold to the collection agency listed \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b. (AE B at 2-4).  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g is found in favor of Applicant.  \n \nApplicant separated from the Air Force due to a reduction in force. In 2000, he \nwas reduced from Staff Sergeant (E-5) to Senior Airman (E-4) as a result of an Article \n15 nonjudicial punishment for Driving While Under the Influence. (Tr at 65,70; Gov 1, \nsection 23.) He received $28,192 in separation pay when he separated on April 25, \n2005. When asked whether he applied any of the money towards his delinquent \naccounts, Applicant stated taxes took a portion of the money. He used the money to live \non during the three months he was unemployed after separating from the Air Force. (Tr \nat 70-72; AE C.) \n \nApplicant states that he did not intend to falsify his e-QIP application. He initially \ntestified that he was not aware of any delinquent accounts until he looked at his credit \nreport. (Tr at 14, 37.) Under cross examination, he admits that he was aware that he \nhad some debts at the time he completed his e-QIP application and should have \nindicated he had some delinquent debts on his e-QIP application. He was not aware of \nthe full extent of his delinquent accounts. In the future, he will be more proactive in \nproviding this information. (Tr at 51-53.)  \n \nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 bought a house. She refinanced her mortgage eight \nmonths ago and put Applicant\u2019s name of the house. (Tr at 87-88.) She just recently \nreturned to work after giving birth to their son. (Tr at 56.) Their combined monthly \nincome is $2,088.  Their monthly expenses consist of a $626 mortgage payment; a \n$412 truck payment; $110 car insurance; $140 gas; $100 utilities; $300 groceries.  They \npay a total of $125 towards four credit card accounts. Their total monthly expenses are \n$1,813.69.  After expenses, they have $274.31 left over in discretionary income. (AE H \nat 1-2.) Applicant also pays $275 per month in child support. It is unclear whether this is \ntaken out of his paycheck through an allotment or if this is an additional expense. (Tr at \n55.)   \n \nWhen he was on active duty, Applicant received numerous awards and \ndecorations, including the Air Force Commendation Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal with Bronze Star, the Air Force Longevity Service Medal with two oak leaf \nclusters. (AE C; AE F; AE H at 5.) He was nominated for Airman of the Quarter for July- \nSeptember 1999 (AE E.) From March 2004 to June 2004, he deployed to the Middle \nEast in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, and \nCombined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa.  He won a Desert Warrior Award for his \ndedicated efforts while deployed and received an outstanding evaluation. (AE D; AE H \nat 6.)  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nIn his current job, Applicant was Employee of the Quarter for July \u2013 September \n2007. (AE H at 3.) Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 testified that she has known him for six years. She \nis helping him resolve his past debts. He is very good worker, a great person, an \nawesome dad, and a good boyfriend. He has matured. (Tr at 76-85.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations. He incurred ten delinquent accounts with a total approximate \nbalance of $14,978. \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nAlthough Applicant maintains he is current on his recent debts, aside from one account \nhe took no steps to resolve any of the delinquent accounts. Most of these accounts \nbecame delinquent between 2001 to 2004. When he separated from active duty in April \n2005, he received over $28,000 in separation pay. He had the opportunity to resolve a \nlot of the accounts at that time but did nothing. Questions remain about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment based on his lack of action towards resolving his \ndelinquent accounts.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Applicant states most of his \nfinancial problems were the result of financial irresponsibility as opposed to conditions \nthat were beyond his control.  He experienced some expenses in 2001 when he \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndivorced his first wife. However, most of the accounts became delinquent after 2001. \nApplicant\u2019s separation from the Air Force cannot be considered a factor. Although he \nwas unemployed for three months, his expenses were covered by his separation pay. In \nfact, it is likely Applicant had money left over from his separation pay which could have \nbeen applied towards his delinquent accounts.     \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant received financial counseling in 1999 while on active \nduty. He has no recent financial counseling. His financial situation is not under control. \nNine delinquent accounts remain unresolved. It is unlikely that his financial situation will \nbe under control in the near future based on the budget Applicant submitted after the \nhearing.  After expenses, Applicant has a little over $200 left over each month. This is \nnot enough to resolve his delinquent accounts and account for unanticipated expenses.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.k because he submitted proof that he paid the debt. It does not apply with regard to \nhis remaining delinquent accounts due to his lack of effort in resolving these accounts.  \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his \ndelinquent accounts in response to questions 28(a) and 28(b) on his e-QIP application. \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 17(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. Applicant initially stated that \nhe was not aware that he had delinquent debts. He later testified that he was aware that \nhe had some delinquent accounts prior to filling out his e-QIP application. He admitted \nthat he should have answered \u201cyes\u201d to questions 28(a) and 28(b). He did not have a \nrecent credit report and was not aware of the full extent of the delinquent accounts. I \nfind Applicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP application. He was aware that he had \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsome delinquent accounts and should have indicated that he had delinquent accounts \non his e-QIP application. None of the mitigating conditions apply under personal \nconduct. I find against Applicant with respect to the personal conduct concern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \ncareer, including his deployments and awards and decorations. I considered the \ntestimony of his fianc\u00e9. However, Applicant\u2019s financial situation and his lack of candor \nrelated to his delinquent debts on his e-QIP application remain security concerns. He \nresolved one out of the ten delinquent accounts. Although he testified that he intends to \npay off the delinquent accounts in the future, his budget reveals that he has very little \nincome left over each month to apply towards these delinquent accounts. Security \nconcerns remain under financial considerations. Security concerns remain under the \npersonal conduct concern related to his deliberate lack of candor regarding his \ndelinquent debts on his e-QIP application. Applicant did not meet his burden to mitigate \nthe concerns raised under the financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-\nQIP) on February 4, 2006. On November 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on February 6, 2008. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on February 7, \n2008. Applicant received the FORM on March 3, 2008.  He had 30 days from receipt of \nthe FORM to submit any additional material.  He did not respond to the FORM. The \nFORM was forwarded to the hearing office on April 29, 2008 and assigned to me on \nJune 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nMay 2, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 5, 2007, Applicant admitted SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.d, 1.i, 1.m, 1.s, 1.u, 1.v, 1.y, and 1.ad, He denies the remaining SOR allegations.  \n(Item 4.)  \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with the defense contractor since \nMay 2005. He was born in Nigeria. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on July 6, \n2001. He is married and has no children. (Item 5.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed 33 delinquent accounts, a total \napproximate balance of $49,126.  The delinquent accounts include: a $288 medical \naccount placed for collection in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 2; \nItem 8 at 2); a $620 account placed for collection in July 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Item 6 at 7; \nItem 7 at 12; Item 8 at 4); a $99 account placed for collection in June 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; \nItem 6 at 2; Item 7 at 4, 5, 16; Item 8 at 2, 3); a $264 delinquent cell phone account \nplaced for collection in June 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 17, 19; Item 8 at \n2); a $934 satellite television account placed for collection in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 4, 17, 18, 19; Item 8 at 2); a $3,568 credit card account \nplaced for collection in July 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Item 7 at 11); a $1,021 account placed for \ncollection in October 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Item 8 at 4); a $619 account placed for collection \nin October 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Item 8 at 3); a $54 delinquent cell phone account placed \nfor collection in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Item 7 at 11; Item 8 at 4); a $1,308 delinquent \ncredit card account placed for collection in November 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.j; Item 6 at 6; Item \n7 at 10, 19); a $507 delinquent credit card account placed for collection in May 2003 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k; Item 6 at 6; Item 7 at 10, 16; Item 8 at 3); a $3,465 delinquent credit card \naccount placed for collection in May 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.l; Item 6 at 6; Item 7 at 14, 18; Item \n8 at 3); a $950 gas station credit card account that was charged off in March 2002 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.m; Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 14; Item 8 at 2-3); a $1,529 account charged off in July \n2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.n; Item 6 at 5); an $826 delinquent credit card account charged off in \nAugust 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.o; Item 7 at 9; Item 8 at 3); a $500 delinquent account charged \noff in October 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.p; Item 6 at 5; Item 7 at 9; Item 8 at 2); a $1,020 \ndelinquent credit card account charged off in January 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.q; Item 6 at 7; \nItem 7 at 11; Item 8 at 2); a $3,696 delinquent account placed for collection in July 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.r; Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 16); a $653 delinquent credit card account placed for \ncollection in August 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.s; Item 7 at 4, 16; Item 8 at 4); a $1,680 delinquent \naccount placed for collection in March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.t; Item 7 at 4, 17); a $261 \ndelinquent phone account placed for collection in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.u; Item 7 at 12, \n17; Item 8 at 3); a $262 delinquent account placed for collection in November 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.v; Item 7 at 18); a $144 cable account placed for collection in February 2001 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.w; Item 7 at 18); a $127 cable account placed for collection in July 2000 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.x; Item 7 at 18); a $478 delinquent account placed for collection in May 2002 (SOR \n\n \n3 \n \n \n\u00b6 1.y; Item 7 at 19); a $7,116 delinquent account placed for collection in July 2006  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.z; Item 7 at 5); a $9,327 delinquent account placed for collection in \nSeptember 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.aa; Item 7 at 9); a $5,233 delinquent account placed for \ncollection in September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.ab; Item 7 at 9); a $254 delinquent account \nplaced for collection in September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.ac; Item 7 at 8); a $477 delinquent \naccount placed for collection in April 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.ad; Item 6 at 6; Item 7 at 10); a \n$723 delinquent account placed for collection in April 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.ae; Item 6 at 5; \nItem 7 at 8); a $641 delinquent credit card charged off in April 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.af; Item 7 \nat 6); and a $472 judgment entered in December 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.ag; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 \nat 3; Item 8 at 1.)  \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant did not explain why he denies the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.t, \n1.w, 1.x, 1.z, 1.aa, 1.ab, 1.ac, 1.ae, 1.af, and 1.ag.  He did not provide information on \nthe status of any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He did not provide information as to \nwhat caused his financial problems. He did not provide information about his current \nfinancial status, such as a monthly budget.  He did not provide information about his \nwork performance.       \n \nBased on the record evidence, I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.j \nbecause the credit report dated, January 13, 2007, lists the debt as paid. (Item 7 at 19.) \nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.r because it is a duplicate of the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.aa.  SOR \u00b6 1.aa lists the most recent creditor and balance. (Item 6 at 8; Item \n7 at 9, 16.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since 2000, Applicant has a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations. He incurred 32 delinquent accounts, an approximate \ntotal balance of $49,126.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has provided no information as to what caused his financial problems and \nwhat steps, if any, have been taken to resolve his financial situation.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) cannot be applied. There is nothing in the \nrecord evidence suggesting the applicability of FC MC \u00b6 20(b).  \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling and no information was provided regarding steps taken to resolve his \nfinancial situation.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j because a January 13, 2007 credit report indicates the debt was paid.  However, at \nthe close of the record, the status of 31 delinquent accounts, an approximate total of \n$44,122 remained uncertain. I cannot conclude that Applicant initiated a good-faith \neffort to resolve his overdue accounts.     \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. While Applicant denies 25 of the debts alleged in the SOR, he \nprovided no explanation as to why he denies them and/or supporting documentation \nwhich indicates he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebts.   \n \nUnder the revised AG, the overall concern under financial considerations is not \nonly whether a person who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds, but also the failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations to his creditors remains \na security concern. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

On December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on March 31, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 2, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 18, 2008. The government offered\nExhibits (GE.) 1 through 6 which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B. Department Counsel had no objection\nto the submission. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on April 28, 2008.\nApril 30, 2008\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 7, 2008 Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c of the SOR, with explanations. At the hearing, Counsel\nconceded that the allegation in 1.b is not true and withdrew the allegation. Applicant\nprovided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant is one of\nseven children who was raised by her mother due to her father\u2019s early death. Applicant\ngraduated from high school in 1973 and attended community college classes in 1974-\n1975 (Tr. 16).\nApplicant married in 1979. She and her husband had three children (GE 1).\nDuring the marriage Applicant worked despite her health problems. The marriage was\nan unpleasant, difficult and abusive one for Applicant. She and her husband separated\nin approximately 1997-1998 after 20 years of marriage. Although Applicant tried to\nreconcile for the good of the family, they eventually divorced in 2001 (Tr. 64).\nWhen Applicant and her husband separated, Applicant had custody of her three\nchildren. She did not receive any financial assistance or support from her ex-husband.\nNor did she request any government assistance. She left the state and moved to her\nhome town. However, Applicant could not find employment. In fact, she was\nunemployed for one year (1998-1999). She eventually found employment but it was part\ntime until 2001(Tr. 25). \nIn 2001, Applicant gained full time employment as an admissions counselor. This\nposition ended in October 2003. Applicant moved back to another state to find\nemployment. In October 2003, she was offered employment. After she began the job,\nher sister became critically ill and was dying. Applicant was needed to help take care of\nher sister. Applicant lived with and cared for her sister for seven months (Tr. 23). \nWhen Applicant was working in 2003, she believed she had health insurance.\nDuring a five day retreat for work she became ill and collapsed. She was taken to the\nhospital by ambulance. She presented her insurance information to the hospital.\nHowever, the insurance had not yet started. Applicant had coverage under COBRA but\nneglected to give the hospital that information. She did not receive any bills from the\nhospital (Tr. 33). \nApplicant has health problems. She has a heart condition (Tr. 19).She has had\nrecurring bouts with pneumonia since the age of two. Due to her medical problems, she\ncould not work for a long time. She takes medication on a regular basis.\n\nThe SOR does not allege any Guideline E (Personal Conduct) allegation(s).\n1\nThe medical bills that occurred during her marriage should have been marital debts and not just the\n2\nresponsibility of Applicant. However, Applicant assumed responsibility for her medical bills.\nAssuming this debt occurred while Applicant was working in Florida, it is possible that is may be barred by\n3\nthe Statute of Limitations. This debt could fall under the 4-year limitation period (F.S. 95.11(3)(p) and not be\nlegally collectable.\n3\nApplicant has been employed in her current position since July 2005. She is well\nregarded by her colleagues. She is making more money than she ever did before this\nemployment. Her supervisor commends her and reports that Applicant has provided\ncritical, timely assistance to her and the staff. Applicant performs at a high level and is\npersonally responsible for many of the successful projects under the security\ndirectorate. She displays remarkable personal initiative, dedication, and a willingness to\ngo far beyond what is expected to ensure the success of a mission. She is a person of\nhigh morals and unquestionable integrity. The Director of Security stated that without\nhesitation, he strongly recommends Applicant for continued employment in areas\nrequiring personnel security clearances (AE A and B).\nApplicant is proud and happy to serve in this position and serve the military. She\nwas never well enough to have an opportunity to join the military and believes that she\nis now making a contribution to her country. She loves what she does and understands\nthat her employer has total confidence in her (Tr. 19).\nIn January 2007, DSS interviewed Applicant concerning her financial difficulties.1\nShe acknowledged that she had a hospital bill, but she was not aware of any judgment.\nAlso, she was not aware of the $10,088 bill for the second hospital because she had not\nreceived anything from them. Applicant had some health problems during her marriage.\nIn fact, she was ill with pneumonia often and would incur medical or hospital bills.2\nThere were daily necessities that needed to be paid for and the hospital bill was not a\npriority. However, she does have medical bills that have been paid in the past.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment entered in 2001 in the amount of $3,047, plus costs and\nattorneys\u2019 fees for a total debt of approximately $3,673. Applicant does not recall being\nserved.  Applicant believes the bill is from a hospital visit in 1996 or 1997. She became\nill and had to recuperate for a long period of time. Her ex-husband was not working at\nthe time. She did not have enough income to pay the daily necessities for her family and\npay the hospital bill at the same time. Applicant contacted the hospital at some point in\nthe past. She could not remember the exact date. She did not have the amount of\nmoney they wanted for a monthly payment. Her wages were never garnished (Tr. 64).\nShe sent them an email recently and is in the process of arranging a payment plan. (Tr.\n28).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a medical bill in the amount of $10,088. As discussed above, this\nbill was incurred when Applicant was on a work retreat and collapsed. She had chest\npains and an ambulance was called. This was in late 2003 or 2004.  Applicant did not\n3\n\nCounsel introduced a recent judgment in the amount of $250 that Applicant was not aware of from a hospital.\n4\nThis was admitted into the record. However, Applicant was not evasive about the fact that she has continuing\nmedical bills. \n4\nreceive a bill from the hospital. She learned of the debt when the DSS investigator\nspoke with her in 2007 (Tr. 29).  After the interview, she discussed the $10,000 medical\ncollection account with an a financial agency. They wanted $288 per month. She knew\nshe could not commit to that monthly amount. After that, Applicant contacted the\nhospital directly. She has reached an agreement with the hospital collection recently. An\namount of $100 is to be debited from her checking account each month until her\ndaughter graduates from college. At that time, Applicant will double the amount of\npayment (Tr. 53).\nAt the hearing, Counsel noted that the investigators discussed a number of\ndifferent debts listed on the credit report (GE 4); (Tr. 38). Applicant has resolved some\nof those debts and they do not appear on her current credit report (GE 3). She\nacknowledged that she did not pay all of them and possibly that her sister had done so\n(Tr. 38).\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is approximately $2,742. After monthly\ndeductions and expenses, she has a net remainder of approximately $500 a month (GE\n2). She has a budget. She spends $80 a month on prescriptions. She also factors in\n$300 a month for miscellaneous expenses. This would cover an expense that would\noccur suddenly. She does not use credit cards. She lives a frugal life style. She has\npaid other medical bills over the years. She also has current medical bills that she is\npaying.  She also noted on her personal financial statement that she had a $500\n4\nmedical bill to pay.\nWhen Counsel asked Applicant about whether she takes vacations, Applicant\nwas candid in her response that she sometimes goes with her sister. Her sister has a\ntime share and this involves little or no expense for Applicant (Tr. 61).\nApplicant has not received any financial counseling recently. She did contact a\ncompany that was recommended to her for debt consolidation. The company would\nhelp her restore her credit. She could not use their services, however, because, she did\nnot have the money for their fee.\nApplicant\u2019s daughter still resides with her. She is now a junior in college and\nApplicant pays for her books and other expenses. She does not pay for her tuition. Her\ntwo sons are also in college. She also helps them financially.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has two delinquent medical debts that total about $13,700.\nShe has not been able to pay them for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose due to her ex-husband\u2019s unemployment, her illness, her marital\nseparation, pending divorce, unemployment and underemployment. She is now earning\na steady, full time income. The Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing, but she is now\nresolving them. Her family situation has changed because she is now divorced. This\npotentially mitigating condition applies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose from her separation, lower earnings and medical bills. She\nacted responsibly by working and living modestly during her underemployment. I find\nthis potentially mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling recently, but she did\ncontact several consolidation companies to help her resolve the delinquent debt. She is\n\n7\nnow in a more financially sound situation. She will begin to pay the two hospital bills and\nwill pay more when her daughter graduates from college. Also, she had no knowledge\nof the judgment for the first debt and had received nothing from the second hospital.\nThe debt of $10,088 may have been barred by the Statute of Limitations since it is\nprobably more than 4 years old. However, it is noteworthy that Applicant chooses to\nrepay this debt even though it may not have been legally enforceable. However, a\npayment on the debt has the potential to reinstate it, and to end a statute of limitations\ndefense to collection. (F.S. 95.11(3)(p)). I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions apply in part.\nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and\njudicial value of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitation embody important public policy\nconsiderations in that they stimulate activity, punish\nnegligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability \nto \nhuman \naffairs. \nThe \ncornerstone \npolicy\nconsideration underlying statutes of limitations is the\nlaudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in\nlitigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide\npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of\ntime, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs\nform sitting on their rights. Statutes of limitations are, indeed,\nfundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. V. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E. 2d. 548, 552\n(S.C.Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, this does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a hardworking single\nparent. She was in a marriage for 20 years and made a difficult decision to separate\nfrom her husband. They divorced in 2001. Her husband did not financially support their\nthree children. She has health problems which sometimes impeded her ability to work.\nApplicant also had a period of unemployment and low paying positions that made it\ndifficult for her to pay all her medical bills. Applicant also is the sole provider for her\ndaughter who is a junior in college. She has finally found a good paying position. She\nhas never made the income that she is making now. Her employer recommends her\nhighly. Her colleagues believe she is a great asset to the company. She has struggled\nfinancially for a long period of time. She tried to seek help and contacted a credit\nconsolidation company. She did not have the amount of money that they required for a\nmonthly payment on her medical bill. She does not live beyond her means. She takes\npride in her job and is described as trustworthy. Of course, the issue is not simply\nwhether all her debts are paidBit is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns\nabout her fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant is addressing her two\ndelinquent medical debts. She reported her financial information during her security\ninvestigation. She has met her burden of proof in this case to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Five of the debts \nhave been paid and she is paying the remaining two. After a thorough review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and evidence, I conclude Applicant has rebutted or \nmitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance.

On April 22, 2008, I was assigned the case. On May 7, \n2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on May 20, 2008. \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through Q, which were \nadmitted into evidence. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional matters. On June 2, 2008, additional documents were received. Department \nCounsel did not object to the material and it was admitted into evidence as Ex. R. On \nJune 5, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b \nand 1.e of the SOR. She denies the remaining allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old team analyst (Tr. 40) who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since July 2005, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Supervisors, \nco-workers, friends, and family state Applicant is honest, dependable, responsible, \nambition, dedicated, committed to work, willing to take on new challenges, and a \ndependable team player. She is budge conscious, financially responsible, and willing to \nshare her financial knowledge. (Exs. C, D, E) Applicant duty performance \u201cExceeded \nexpectations.\u201d (Exs. G, O)  \n \n \nIn November 1998, Applicant \u2500 then 19 years old \u2500 was forced into bankruptcy \nwhen her mother chose bankruptcy. (Tr. 86)  She had co-signed with her mother on a \n$30,000 mobile home, which went to foreclosure.  \n \n \nApplicant has financially supported her mother and younger brother following \nhigh school. In August 2000, she obtained her bachelor\u2019s of business administration \ndegree and obtained employment. Applicant returned to school from August 2001 \nthrough December 2003, and obtained a master\u2019s of business administration (MBA) \ndegree. (Tr. 39, 65) Since graduation, she has had periods of unemployment. She was \nunemployed from March 2004 to May 2004 and in April 2005 and May 2005. She \nmaintained contact with her creditors at that time. (Ex. F) She is currently working on a \nmaster\u2019s degree in finance, which she hoped to complete in December 2008. (Tr. 39, \nEx. R) Her student loans are deferred while she is still in school. (Tr. 66)  \n \n \nWhile unemployed in 2004, Applicant was overpaid $1,630 by the state \ndepartment of employment. (Ex. K) The amount of overpayment represents five weeks \nat $326 weekly payments. (Tr. 71) She is repaying the amount at a rate of $50 per \nmonth. (Ex. L) In 2004, Applicant entered into an agreement with a credit counseling \n \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\nservice to help her pay her delinquent debt. (Ex. P) The agreement required her to pay \n$315 per month. She paid six of the debts in the agreement and is making payment on \nthe remaining two. The same debt is the obligations listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e, which are \ntwo credit collection agencies each of which were attempting to collect the same debt, \nat different times. (Tr. 33) The other debt was the overpayment of unemployment \ncompensation, which she is paying. (Tr. 33)  \n \n \nApplicant owes a department store/mail order company credit card debt, (Tr. 30) \nwhich is listed twice in the SOR as owed to two different creditors (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e).  This \nis a single debt. (Tr. 51) Applicant starting making payments on this debt in April 2007. \nShe currently has $86.22 plus $9.95 automatically deducted monthly from her checking \naccount. She has made 14 monthly payments on the debt, paying $1,346 on this debt. \n(Ex. A, Ex. 2) \n \n \nApplicant purchased a car and made prompt payments for three years. Due to \nher 2004 unemployment, Applicant gave the car to her mother with the understanding \nher mother would make the payments. (Tr. 46) Her mother was unable to continue with \nthe payments and the car was repossessed leaving an $8,400 debt. (\u00b6 1.a) Applicant \nestablished a repayment plan with the law firm collecting the debt. Starting in November \n2007, Applicant has made seven months payments on the debt paying $1,850 on this \ndebt. (Exs. A, R) In June 2008, she will increase her monthly payments from $250 to \n$300.  \n \n \nApplicant satisfied a $147 debt (\u00b6 1.c) in January 2008 as evidenced by \nwithdrawals from her checking account. (Tr. 28, Ex. A, Ex. 2) Applicant satisfied a $201 \nhealth care debt (\u00b6 1.d) in March 2008 as evidenced by withdrawals from her checking \naccount. (Tr. 29, Ex. A, Ex. 2) Applicant satisfied a $1,649 credit card debt (\u00b6 1.f) in May \n2007 as evidenced by a July 2007 letter from the creditor stating the account was \nsettled in full. (Tr. 30, Ex. A) Applicant satisfied a $82 telephone debt (\u00b6 1.g) in \nNovember 2007 as evidenced by a December 2007 letter from the creditor stating the \naccount was paid in full. (Ex. A) \n \n \nIn April of 2005, Applicant was unemployed and then obtained a minimum wage \nposition. Her previous job was $30,000 and the job she obtained was $6 per hour. (Tr. \n34) Since July 2005, she has been with her current employer with a current yearly \nsalary of $51,125. (Ex. G) She earns $1,966 every two weeks. (Ex. R) Her annual \nsalary has increased approximately $11,000 in the three years she has been employed. \n(Tr. 75) Applicant is current on her rent, car payments, and her one remaining credit \ncard. (Tr. 34, Ex. N) She maintains the single credit card because the credit counseling \nservice told her this was one way to improve her credit score. (Tr. 34) She has not \nincurred any new debt. (Tr. 34) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n \n \n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial \nobligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $15,000 on seven debts. Disqualifying \nConditions (DC) \u00b6 19. a \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19. c \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20 d, the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where, \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has paid five of the debts and is making \nmonthly payments on the remaining two obligations (SOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b/1.e). \nApplicant has been making her payments long enough to find she will continue these \npayments until the obligations are paid. I find AG \u00b6 20 d applies.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20. a, the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems \nwere contributed to by periods of unemployment and underemployment. She has paid \nthe majority of her debts and is making payment on the remaining two obligations. I find \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n6\nthe behavior occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does \nnot raise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The \nevidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 a.  \n \nUnder AG & 20. b, it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, she \nsuffered periods of unemployment and underemployment. Since obtaining her current \njob, she has not incurred additional debt and is current on her rent, car payment, and \nsingle credit card. I find the evidence establishes this mitigating condition.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20. (c). Applicant is current on her debts and is not \nliving beyond her means. Her financial problem is under control. I conclude this \nmitigating condition applies. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe \nfacts \nand \ncircumstances \nsurrounding \nthis \ncase. \nUnemployment \nand \nunderemployment contributed to her financial problems. Applicant has acted \nresponsibly to resolve her debts and improve her current financial picture. She is a \nmature, responsible adult who has exhibited reliability and sound judgment on duty. She \nis acting to ensure her past financial difficulties will not recur. The majority of her bills \nhave been paid and the two remaining debts are being paid. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n\n \n \n \n7\nsuitability for a security clearance. The facts and circumstances presented do not pose \nan unacceptable risk to the interests of national security. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

He\nexpressed his willingness to sign a statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation, but has not been requested to make any such statement.\nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor is aware of the clearance issues, but opines that\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated trustworthiness and reliability on the job warrants his getting\nhis clearance (A.E. A). Nevertheless, Applicant does not believe that his job is at risk if\nhe does not obtain his clearance.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00a7 25.(a) any drug abuse ; (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\n3\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\u00b6 26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b6  26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug\n5\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\n3\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana between February 2002 and\nFebruary 2005.  However, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns, by\n3\ndemonstrating that the use was under circumstances unlikely to recur,  and further\n4\ndemonstrating intent to not abuse drugs in the future.  While Applicant\u2019s use is fairly\n5\ncharacterized as \u201crecent,\u201d this term has less meaning under the new adjudicative\ncriteria, where the corresponding language \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago. . .\u201d [\u00b6\n26.(a)], is used in the disjunctive with language that clearly applies to Applicant. In\naddition, while his marijuana use was not \u201cinfrequent,\u201d neither is it properly\ncharacterized as frequent or regular. The bulk of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred\nwhile he was in college in a state he moved from to take his current job. With the\n\n4\nexception of his former roommates, he no longer associates with any of the individuals\nhe used marijuana with, and his roommates foreswore further drug use. Finally, while\nhis abstention from marijuana use since February 2007 might not necessarily constitute\nan appropriate period of abstinence, given the minimal marijuana use by Applicant and\nhis change in environment\u2014both physical (new state) and psychological (career versus\nschool)\u2014I conclude that this abstinence is appropriate [\u00b6 26.(b)]. On this record, it is\nextremely unlikely that Applicant would return to illegal drug use. Accordingly, I resolve\nGuideline H for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline H: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 8, 2008, admitted all of the allegations\nand requested an administrative determination. On February 25, 2008, department\ncounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received it on March 7,\n2008, and mailed a reply on March 31, 2008. Department counsel did not object to the\nattachments included with the reply, and on April 2, 2008, the case was assigned to me.\nI have reviewed the FORM and have concluded that eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nApril 25, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 24-year-old single man. He graduated from college in May 2007\nwith a bachelor of science degree in accounting. Since graduating, he has worked on\nthe staff of an accounting firm where he had interned the previous two summers during\ncollege (Item 4 at 16).\nFrom 2002 through 2004, Applicant smoked marijuana approximately three times\nper week (Item 5 at 3). Typically, he would purchase it, bring it to his apartment, and\nsmoke it in a bong pipe with his roommate. In 2004, he restricted his use to the\nweekends. He stopped in April 2007, shortly before graduating from college because he\nwanted to start looking for a career (Item 5 at 3). He disclosed his marijuana use on his\nsecurity clearance application.\nApplicant does not intend to use marijuana in the future (Signed, Statement of\nIntent, as Included in Reply at 5).He recently took and passed a drug screening (Reply\nat 7). He no longer associates with friends who use marijuana, and lives with his\nparents, far from college where his marijuana abuse occurred. He spends his spare\ntime volunteering as a coach in a local, teen basketball league.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \n\n3\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug . . . can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s college marijuana use triggers the application\nof AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession . . . including\npurchase . . . or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\nApplicant has not smoked marijuana since April 2007. Since then, he has\ngraduated from college and obtained a full-time job. He no longer associates with his\nmarijuana-smoking friends, has not visited college since graduating, and spends his\nfree time coaching in a youth basketball league. These changes in addition to his\nexecution of a statement of intent with revocation of clearance for any violation, trigger\nthe application of AG \u00b6 25 (b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts,\u201d AG \u00b6 25 (b)(2), changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25 (b)(4), \u201ca signed, statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\u201d\nThese steps, though encouraging, are not sufficient at this time to mitigate the\ndrug involvement security concern. Given the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use, and the frequency of his participation in college, not enough\ntime has elapsed to conclude it no longer poses a security concern. Applicant argues\npersuasively that his dedication to his job is evidence of his maturity and changed\nlifestyle. However, he interned at this same firm for two summers during college when\nhe was abusing marijuana. Consequently, his dedication to his job has limited probative\nvalue with respect to gauging whether his marijuana use will recur in the future.\nApplicant has not mitigated the drug involvement security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct\nand all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant deserves credit for disclosing the extent of his marijuana use. He is\nactive in his community and committed to his job. These positive attributes are\n\n4\noutweighed by the frequency and extent of his past marijuana use. Consequently,\nalthough a year has elapsed since his last marijuana use, it is too soon to conclude it\ndoes not pose a security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on April 8, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 16, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 6, 2008. The government offered\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf and presented the testimony of one witness. She also submitted Exhibits\n(AE) A through G. Department Counsel had no objection to the exhibits. DOHA received\nMay 21, 2008\n\n2\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr) on May 15, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d of the SOR. She denied 1.e-1.g. Applicant\nprovided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant graduated\nfrom high school in 1996. She attended classes and received multiple training\ncertificates beginning in 1997 (AE B). She completed a number of courses in human\nresource management and supervision in 2007 and 2008. Applicant has been employed\nin her current position since May 25, 2005. She is in a leadership program. She has\ntaken many courses and attained certification in various areas to improve her\nopportunities at work. She received promotions (Tr. 62).\nApplicant is single and has no children. (GE 1). She served in the U.S. Army from\n1996 until 2000. She received an honorable discharge (GE 2). She held a security\nclearance while in the military (AE C) and in her position in 2002 (AE A). \nAfter Applicant left the military she worked for a communications company. She\nwas laid off in October 2001 (Tr. 49). She remained unemployed until 2002 (Tr. 49).\nApplicant also served four years on inactive reserves and was honorably discharged in\n2004 (Tr. 50).\nApplicant completed truck driver training in 2002. At the hearing, she explained\nthat she paid on the training loan until 2003. She claimed that she stopped paying\nbecause she received a phone call from an anonymous source who told her that the\ncompany had fraudulent practices (Tr. 55). Applicant later admitted that she was making\na good salary after the truck driver training. She further explained that she was young\nand not responsible. When she was on the road she chose to ignore the bills and did\nnot pay. It was not because she did not have the money or that she was told not to pay\nit (Tr. 67). She now believes that she cannot afford to pay it and refuses to pay it now\nbecause the account is closed (Tr. 67).\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a collection debt for $10,034. This is the amount that she owed to\nthe truck driving school for training and room and board. As stated above, Applicant has\nno intention of paying this debt (Tr. 67).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a. collection account for $1,078. This debt originated with a cell\nphone plan. When Applicant received the bill she told them that she would not pay it\nbecause it was not the plan that she requested (Tr. 55). She explained that this debt\nwas from the time period that she was in the Army (1999-2000).\n\n3\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card debt that is charged off in the amount of $4,105.\nApplicant used the credit card to pay for her daily personal and business expenses\nwhen she was employed with a communications company in 2002. She admitted owing\nthe money but when she learned that the account was in collection status she decided\nnot to pay it. She acknowledged at the hearing that she was irresponsible (Tr. 74). She\nwill not consider paying it now. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a judgment filed against Applicant in 2005 for unpaid rent in the\namount of $436. Applicant explained that she did pay the rent in cash but the owner\nclaimed that she had not paid the rent (Tr. 76). Applicant had no receipts to prove that\nshe had already paid for the rent. Applicant satisfied the judgment recently (March\n2008) and presented documentation (AE D). She paid the judgment because she wants\nto buy a home and needs a mortgage. This will improve her credit status so that she\ncan more easily obtain a loan (Tr. 76).\nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a collection account for another cell phone bill in the amount of $40.\nShe does not know why that account is listed as a debt. She maintains that she still has\nservice with that company and that if she owed that amount they would not continue her\nservice or would send another bill.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for an account that is charged off in the amount of $1,100. Applicant\nclaimed that she had no knowledge of the account (Tr. 81). However, later in the\nhearing she stated that it might be an account that she had while in the military. She\ncontinued that if that was the case, she paid it (Tr. 82). \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is repetitious with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d. \nAt the hearing, Applicant stressed that if she does not obtain a security clearance\nbecause she may be demoted or laid off from her current position. She enjoys her work\nand wants to advance in her job. She needs the security clearance in order to do that\n(Tr. 60). She believes she is entitled to the clearance based on her previous clearance\nstatus and the fact that she is trying to improve her work situation.\nHowever, Applicant was firm in her resolve to only pay current debts. She will not\n\u201clook back.\u201d She believes it is \u201cold stuff\u201d and she will not pay the delinquent or charged\noff collection accounts listed in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is approximately $1,608. After monthly\ndeductions and expenses, she has a net remainder of approximately $348 a month (GE\n5). She has not had any financial counseling and believes that she does not need any.\nShe now pays her bills as soon as they are due.\nApplicant\u2019s partner with whom she lives, stated that Applicant is very honest and\nhas high morals. The partner testified that Applicant is a hard worker. They share\nexpenses for the home (Tr. 99).\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has delinquent debts that total about $16,000. She also\nhad a judgment from 2005 in the amount of $436 until very recently. She admitted that\nshe has not paid the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems were a result of some irresponsible behavior. She is now earning a\nsteady, full time income. She is firm in her decision not to pay the debts because they\nare old debts.  This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant admitted that she was young and not responsible. She stopped paying on one\nof the accounts in 2003. She has no intention of paying anything now. She was\nunemployed for a period of time but did not explain how that impacted her ability to pay\nat least a portion of the debts. When re-employed, Applicant did not pay the debts. This\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\n\n6\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. She does not see the\nneed and is clear in her resolve not to pay the delinquent debts. She has not shown\ngood faith with her creditors. She was candid about why she just paid the 2005\njudgment for $436. She wanted to obtain a mortgage and needed to pay the judgment\nto get a loan. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d This condition does not apply because she did\nnot provide any documented proof.\nI conclude for Applicant with respect to SOR allegation 1.g because it is\nredundant with the allegations 1. a to 1.d.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a hardworking person.\nShe has taken many courses to improve her opportunity to succeed at her work. She is\ncurrent with her bills. However, she does not take responsibility for the debts that she\nincurred in the past. She prefers to have the accounts closed and is waiting for them to\ndrop off her credit report. She paid the 2005 judgment because she wants to obtain a\nmortgage. She is clear in her resolve that she will not pay the other debts. She has not\nshown good faith with her creditors. She had a clearance for a period of time and\nbelieves that she is entitled to one now. Applicant has not met her burden of proof in\nthis case to overcome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 3, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 4, 2009, and reassigned to me on March 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 17, 2009, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on April 8, \n2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were received without \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A and B, \nwhich were received without objection. The record was held open until April 17, 2009, if \nApplicant wanted to submit additional information. He did not submit any additional \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 15, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old part-time employee of a defense contractor. He is \napplying for his first security clearance in order to work at his part-time job. His full-time \nemployment does not require a security clearance. He is a high school graduate with a \ncertification attained for his full-time job. He is married with three children, ages 13, 9, \nand 7.1  \n \n \nApplicant has struggled financially for a number of years. He worked from 1993 \nto 2005, as an employee of a small city that is located close to a much larger \nmetropolitan area. He left the job in March 2005. He was unemployed for about three \nmonths. He testified that the job and work environment had become unbearable. He \nwas miserable and it was affecting his relationship with his family. He wrote in response \nto DOHA interrogatories that he quit his job and part-time jobs to spend time with his \nfamily because they had grown apart and needed to reconnect. Debts became \ndelinquent during his unemployment and for some time thereafter. When he started \nworking again about three months later, it was at a lower salary than at his previous \njob.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted to all the debts, but he stated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m had \nbeen paid.   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d, 1.f, 1.j, and 1.p allege medical debts totaling about $1,208. \nApplicant admitted to owing all the debts in his response to the SOR. None of the debts \nhave been paid, but he stated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f have been deleted from his \ncredit report because they were his wife\u2019s medical bills. The debts are listed on the most \nrecent credit report in evidence. Applicant did not submit any documentation supporting \nhis statement that the debts have been deleted from his credit report.3    \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 25-26, 49-51; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 34-38, 48-49. \n \n3 Tr. at 25, 27, 38, 40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the delinquent debt of $11,963, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h. This debt resulted from the deficiency owed on a car loan after the car was \nrepossessed in 2005. He has not made any payments on this debt since the car was \nrepossessed.4  \n \n \nApplicant lost his home to foreclosure in 2005. He owed about $101,500 on the \nmortgage when the property was foreclosed. This is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant \nstated that he thought he had a fixed rate mortgage and did not understand, and the \nmortgage company would not tell him, why the monthly payments kept going up. He \nindicated that he could not afford to pay the mortgage when it went from $800 to almost \n$1,500 per month. It is unclear what, if any, deficiency is still owed on the mortgage. \nApplicant stated that since the foreclosure, he has not heard from the mortgage \ncompany seeking any additional money.5   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a delinquent debt of $211. Applicant settled this debt in full for \n$105 on December 4, 2008. He testified that he paid the delinquent debt of $95 to a \njeweler, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, in January 2009. The credit reports in evidence reflect \nthat he was making payments on this account and that $95 was what remained on an \ninstallment contract. I accept Applicant\u2019s testimony and find that this debt has been \npaid.6    \n \n \nApplicant does not dispute that he owes any of the remaining five debts, which \ntotal $5,906. He has not made payments on any of the five debts, but stated that he \nintends to pay all his delinquent debts. He hopes to be able to pay the debts with the \nincome earned from his second job. He has not received financial counseling, but he \nindicated that his wife plans on enrolling in a financial course.7    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation for his full-time job reflects that he is a \nvaluable employee whose performance is commendable.8  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 30-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7. \n \n5 Tr. at 28-30, 43-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-7. \n \n6 Tr. at 39, 41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-7; AE A. \n \n7 Tr. at 39, 43-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-7. \n \n8 AE B. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n5 \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes most of the debts alleged in the SOR. His financial issues \nare ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. His financial problems are related to his \nunemployment for three months in 2005. However, he voluntarily left that position. His \nunemployment was not a condition that was outside his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \napplicable. The minimal payments he made on his debts are insufficient to qualify as a \n\n \n6 \n \ngood-faith effort to repay all his overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. He has \nnot received financial counseling; and I do not find clear indications that his financial \nproblems are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant stated that three of the medical debts were incurred by his wife and \nthey were deleted from his credit report. He did not submit documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute. His testimony is some evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and \n1.f. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant\u2019s \nperformance evaluation for his full-time job shows that he is a valuable employee. He is \nlooking for a security clearance for his part-time job, so that he can pay his debts and \nbetter provide for his family. His financial problems can be traced to his unemployment \nin 2005. However, he made a conscious decision to leave that job. The job may have \nbecome very unpleasant, and it may have helped him become closer to his family to \nhave the time off work, but he still has been unable to climb out of the financial hole that \nhe put himself in. His ongoing financial issues constitute a security concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has paid \nless than $50 on the debts. Additionally, he did not give honest answers when \ncompleting his security clearance applications. Applicant has not successfully mitigated \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 14, 2008, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial problems as \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApril 10, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\nevicenced by delinquent debts and Guideline E, personal conduct, for falsified material \non security clearance questionnaires. The SOR was amended on November 12, 2008 \nalleging additional falsification. \n  \n \nOn August 18, 2008, and September 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. On December 15, 2008, I was assigned the case. On January 5, \n2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on January 22, \n2009. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 15, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and did not submit documents. The \nrecord was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On January 29, \n2009, documents were received. There being no objection, the material was admitted \ninto evidence as Ex. A. On February 3, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record, case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact:  Applicant is 48 years old and is \nemployed by a cleaning service, a defense contractor since August 2004, and is \nseeking to maintain a security clearance. Applicant lives with his mother and provides \nchild support for his two sons, ages 13 and 17. (Ex. 6) He has not taken a day off from \nwork in five years. (Tr. 32)  \n \n \nIn 1990, Applicant and his wife married. While married, both Applicant and his \nwife worked. In the divorce, Applicant\u2019s wife got the home and Applicant got his clothes \nand the debts. (Tr. 79) There were two step-children of the marriage, a step-daughter \nnow age 23 and a step-son age 22. There were two sons born of the marriage, one age \n18 and the other age 14. In 1994, twins, a son and a daughter, were born to Applicant \nand his wife. The daughter died. (Tr. 82) Applicant\u2019s wife never got over the loss. The \nmarriage suffered. In October 2004, she moved out and in October 2006, they were \ndivorced. (Ex. 7) He rarely has contact with his ex-wife. (Tr. 69)  \n \n \nIn January 1999, a charge of making communications in an annoying/alarming \nmanner was dismissed. (Ex. 4) Between 2000 and 2004, Applicant was arrested five \ntimes. (Tr. 72) In March 2002, Applicant was charged with aggravated assault, criminal \nrestraint injury risk, criminal sexual contact, false imprisonment, and criminal mischief \nwith damage. (Ex. 4, 5) Applicant and his wife were having an argument. His wife \nclaimed he made unwanted sexual advances toward her, which he denied. In May \n2002, he pleaded guilty to making communications in annoying/alarming manner, the \nremaining charges were dismissed. (Tr. 63) He was fined $375. (Ex. 4, 7)  \n \n \nIn March 2003, he was charged with theft of services. (Ex. 3, 4) The charge was \nlater dismissed. Applicant does not know what this is about. In April 2003, he was \ncharged with attempt to cause/knowingly bodily injury to another. (Ex. 4) He was \narrested, taken to the police station, and fingerprinted. (Tr. 67) This charge was \ndismissed. In May 2003, he was charged with simple assault. (Ex. 3, 5) This charge was \ndismissed. Applicant was involved in a verbal domestic dispute with his wife. Applicant \nwas attempting to leave the area when his wife blocked his movement. He pushed his \n\n \n \n \n3\nwife and she hit her head. (Ex. 5) Applicant has never struck his ex-wife. (Tr. 62) After \nthe dispute, Applicant moved out of the home and into his own apartment. (Ex.7)  \n \n \nIn August 2004, Applicant moved out of his home and rented an apartment at \n$600 per month. His 20 year old step-daughter moved into the apartment when he \nattempted to reconcile with his wife. (Tr. 70) He attempted to return to the apartment \nwhen the reconciliation failed. His step-daughter refused to vacate the apartment and \nan argument ensued. (Ex. 7) He was arrested and charged with endangering the \nwelfare of a child even though his step-daughter was not a minor. (Ex. 5) In November \n2004, he pleaded guilty to making communications in an annoying/alarming manner and \nwas fined $395. (Ex. 3, 4, Tr.71) \n \nTwo to three months later, his step-daughter left the apartment, the rent went \nunpaid, and a $4,471 debt was incurred. (Ex. 10, p 48, 50, Ex. 11) The debt remains \nunpaid. Applicant has not spoken to anyone at the apartment complex in years. (Tr. 41)  \n \n  \nIn May 2005, he was charged with theft of services. (Ex. 4) The charge was \ndismissed and he was ordered to pay $33 in costs. Again, Applicant has no knowledge \nabout this incident. \n \n \nApplicant has a number of delinquent accounts on which no payment has been \nmade. The SOR lists 12 delinquent accounts on which more than $19,000 is owed. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card debt of $329, which appears on his November 2007 credit \nbureau report (CBR) and January 2009 CBR. (Ex. 9, 15) In January 2009, Applicant \ncontacted the creditor and agreed to pay $10 per month on the debt. (Tr. 35) There is \nno documentation of money having been sent to this creditor. (Tr. 36) SOR \u00b6 1.b is a \ncollection company attempting to collect a $250 medical bill. Applicant states he has \nhad no contact with the collection firm and does not know the nature of the debt. (Tr. 37, \n89) Applicant\u2019s October 2006 (CBR) lists the account as being in dispute. (Ex. 10, p. 43) \n \n \nApplicant claims the $734 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d is his ex-wife\u2019s credit card \naccount. The debt appears on his October 2006 CBR (Ex. 10, p. 46) and his January \n2009 CBR. (Ex. 15) Three years ago, before he left the family home, he was making \n$25 to $30 monthly payments on this debt. (Ex. 7) He remembers receiving letters \nstating the account was delinquent. (Tr. 49) A credit collection firm is attempting to \ncollect two accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.e, $846 and SOR \u00b6 1.g, $448). (Ex. 10, p. 44, 46, 50) \nApplicant claims, but offers no documentation, that both accounts are the same account \nand are for this ex-wife\u2019s credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.d) just referenced. He was asked about \nthese accounts during his December 2006 interview, at which time he speculated the \ndebts may have been the same debt. (Ex. 7) Two debts ($426 and $846) appear on his \nNovember 2007 CBR. (Ex. 9) A $476 debt appears on his January 2009 CBR. (Ex. 15)  \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a credit card account ($498), which was listed on \nApplicant\u2019s CBR as being in \u201cgood standing.\u201d (Ex. 10, p. 47) The same creditor of the \n$417 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h, appears three times on his CBR. (Ex. 10) One entry lists \na $426 charge-off, another entry lists a $460 charge-off, and one account is listed as \n\n \n \n \n4\nbeing in good standing. (Ex. 10, p 46-47) The debt appears as a $417 charge-off on his \nJanuary 2009 CBR (Ex. 15) Applicant has no knowledge about this debt. (Tr. 90)  \n \n \nIn March 1999, Applicant and his wife purchased a Ford van for $12,593 with \n$329 monthly payments. In October 2003, the van broke down and was repossessed. \nThe creditor charged-off $8,424. (Ex. 7, 10, p. 47, Ex. 12) Applicant asserts his then-\nwife failed to forward him any mail addressed to him after he moved from the home. \nHowever, the van was repossessed in October 2003 and he moved out in August 2004. \nApplicant asserts, but provided no documentation, that in November 2006 the creditor \noffered to settle this debt for $3,000. (Ex. 7) In February 2004, the creditor obtained a \njudgment against him. (Tr. 50)  \n \n \nApplicant can not explain the $42 returned check debt (Ex. 10) listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j. (Tr. 55, 92) He disputes the $199 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k) from a collection agency \ncollecting for the county library. (Ex. 10, p. 49, 50) Applicant has no knowledge about \nthis debt. (Tr. 56) Applicant has another credit card not listed as of concern in the SOR \nthat is also delinquent. (Tr. 57)  \n \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to question 27, he responded \u201cno\u201d when \nasked if during the previous seven years he was more than 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt. Applicant can not explain his answer and says it was an error. (Tr. 47) On the \nsame form, he failed to list that property had been repossessed and a judgment entered \nagainst him. The judgment was entered approximately one year before he completed \nhis e-QIP. (Tr. 53) Applicant thought of the repossession as his ex-wife\u2019s repossession \nand not his. (Tr. 53)  \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant completed his Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions, Standard Form (SF) 86. (Ex. 1) In response to question 28, he responded \n\u201cno\u201d when asked if during the last seven years he had ever been more than 180 days \ndelinquent on any debt. Applicant believes he read the question, but failed to read it \nproperly. (Tr. 46)  \n \nIn his October 2006 SF 86, Applicant also failed to list his criminal charges. At \nthe hearing, Applicant stated he did not know why he completed his questionnaires as \nhe did. Applicant admitted the material was not on his SF 86, but denied he intentionally \nomitted the material. (Tr. 17) In a December 2006 interview, Applicant stated he did not \nlist his criminal history on his July 2004 SF 86 because he was found not guilty of all \ncharges. (Ex. 7) At the hearing, he stated he thought there was no charge if the action \nwas dismissed. He also stated he thought he had to list only felonies. (Tr. 63)  \n \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant stated he had contacted some of his creditors and \nwas attempting to settle his debts. (Ex. 8) In August 2008, Applicant stated he had been \nin contact with a few of his creditors and was waiting to start paying them. (Ex. 6) He \nstated he was unaware of all his debts when he completed his questionnaires. \nApplicant\u2019s states some of his creditors are still sending him debt notices. (Tr. 96)  \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n \nApplicant\u2019s yearly gross income is $39,000. (Tr. 29) As of December 2006, \nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross income is $2,772 and his disposable income (gross income \nless $1,144 expenses) was $1,628. (Ex. 7) He pays $802 per month for child support, \nwhich is automatically deducted from his pay. (Tr. 60) He is current on his child support. \n(Tr. 61) Expenses include: $400 in rent, $100 for the cable bill, $300 for groceries, and \n$150 for a cell phone. (Tr. 28, 31) He has no car expense. (Tr. 28) In January 2008, \nApplicant provided a monthly budget showing gross monthly income of $2,938, net \nmonthly income of $1,491 (which includes the child support deduction), and $850 in \nmonthly expenses. The net remainder was $641, which includes no payment to his \ncreditors on the debts listed in the SOR. (Ex. 6, 8) As of January 2009, Applicant was \nreceiving $1,538 gross pay every two weeks. (Ex. A)  \n \nThe week before the hearing, Applicant contacted a consumer credit service \nabout establishing a repayment plan with his creditors. Following the hearing, Applicant \nstated the credit service had contacted his creditors and had requested statement from \nthem. He provided no documentation as to his arrangement with the credit service, the \ndetails of the repayment plan, or the debts included in a repayment plan. Applicant \nprovided documents showing he had made two payments to creditors of $21 and $22. \n(Ex. A)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n \n \n6\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his \nSOR response, his response to interrogatories, and his testimony. Applicant has 12 \ndelinquent debs, totaling more than $19,000. Following the hearing, he made two \npayments which total less than $50. Applicant has provided insufficient documentation \nto show significant progress resolving his debts. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by his \ndivorce and by his step-daughter refusing to leave an apartment he had rented. \nApplicant now lives with his mother. It is unlikely such an apartment debt would recur. \nHowever, the debts remain unpaid and cast doubt on Applicants current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experience both separation and divorce along with \nthe financial burden associated with each. AG & 20(b) has limited applicability. The \ndivorce occurred more than two years ago\u2014in October 2006. Applicant was questioned \nabout his debts in December 2006 and received the SOR in July 2007. Even knowing of \nthe government\u2019s concern over his unpaid debts, Applicant has shown evidence he has \npaid less than $50 on his past due obligations. Under the circumstances, Applicant has \nnot acted responsibility.  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nUnder AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), Applicant has entered into an agreement to pay \n$10 on one of the debts, but has yet to show proof he has made the first payment. \nThere is no showing he has attended financial classes or maintains a budget. His \nmonthly disposable income is $641 and his delinquent debts total more than $19,000. \nAG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant stated he disputed some of his obligations. In 2006, he stated he \nbelieved some of the debts were duplicates. However, he provided no documentation \nsupporting his assertion. Nor did he provide any documentation supporting his dispute. \nAG & 20(e) does not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct, the concern is conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nWhen completing his December 2005 e-QIP and his October 2006 SF 86 he \nfailed to indicate he was delinquent on his debts. He knew his van had been \nrepossessed. He also knew he had delinquent debts. He stated he did not intentionally \nprovide false information, but could not explain his answers on the forms. Additionally, \nbetween 2000 and 2004, he had been arrested five times, some of which involved going \nto the police station and being fingerprinted. Yet he failed to provide his criminal history \non his SF 86 when it asked if he had ever been \u201carrested.\u201d \n \nDue to the nature of his debts and criminal history Applicant should have \ndisclosed both. AG \u00b6 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d applies.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to his false answers. He did not make a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted by the facts, \nthe concealment was not caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice, or so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Additionally, it \noccurred on more than one questionnaire and in response to more than one question. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n9\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The largest two debts were for a \nrepossessed vehicle ($11,206) and past due rent on an apartment ($4,471). These two \ndebts represent 80% of Applicant\u2019s past due obligations. They remain unpaid and \nApplicant has not had recent contact with either creditor. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about \nhis finances. Although his intent to resolve his financial problems appears to be \ngenuine, he has done little to demonstrate that intent. What is missing is: (1) a realistic \nand workable plan to address his financial problems, (2) documented actions taken in \nfurtherance of the plan, and (3) a measurable improvement in the situation. Given the \ncurrent circumstances, it is likely that the financial problems will continue. Additionally, \nhe should have given truthful answers on his questionnaires when asked about his \nfinances and criminal record. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations \nand personal conduct.  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a- 1.l \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n \n10\n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (E-\nQIP) to update his security clearance on May 11, 2007.  On January 30, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns for Applicant under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and \nGuideline L, Outside Activities.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 7, 2008. He answered \nthe SOR in writing February 8, 2008, admitting all factual allegations in the SOR, but \ndenied that the factual allegations create a security concern.  He requested a hearing, \nand DOHA received the request on February 13, 2008.  Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on February 26, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 27, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 6, 2008, and I \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on April 8, 2008.  The government offered three \nexhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1-3, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant submitted eight exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App.Ex.) A \nthrough H, which were received without objection.  Applicant and one other witness \ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nApril 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand. (Tr. 11-14)  \nThe request and the attached supporting documents were not admitted into evidence \nbut were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits I-III.  Applicant had no objection to \nthe request for administrative notice and the attached documents.  The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanation but denied the security concerns raised by the factual allegations. \nHe also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance.   \n \nApplicant is 63 years old, and he has been a senior field representative for a \ndefense contractor in support of the United States Army for two years.  Applicant \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s in music and a master\u2019s degree in education from United States \nuniversities.  He served on active duty in the Army for three years, and then taught \nschool in a public high school for ten years.  He subsequently worked for the United \nStates Army as a civilian educational specialist for 26 years retiring in 2006. He has \nworked with various Army schools as an adviser for education programs. (Tr. 28-44; \nGovernment Exhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, E-QIP, dated May 11, 2007; \nApplicant Exhibit A, Background information, undated) Applicant has continuously held \na security clearance since 1981. (Applicant Exhibit D, Statement of Security Clearance, \ndated January 21, 1982)  Applicant is highly regarded by his present and former \nemployers.  He presented Letters of Appreciation and Commendation for his service as \nan Army civilian.  (Applicant Exhibit C, Letters, dated December 15, 1986, June 3, 1988, \nFebruary 16, 1988, May 31, 1994, and December 16, 1986)  He is also highly regarded \nby his defense contractor employer.  Applicant has always informed his supervisors \nabout his business activities in and trips to the PRC.  (Applicant Exhibit F, Four Letters, \ndated April 4, 2008, and March 17, 2008)  Applicant has also received training on \ncombating terrorism.  (Applicant Exhibit E, Memorandum, dated August 23, 2005)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was married three times to United States citizens.  The marriages \nended in divorce, the last in 1999.  In 1999, Applicant met his present wife, a Chinese \ncitizen living in China, over the internet.  After their internet introduction, Applicant \ntraveled to China in 1999 to meet his new wife and her family.  He stayed in hotels but \nvisited his future wife and her family for social events.  He spent a few hours each day \nwith her family.  Applicant returned to the United States and his future wife joined him in \nthe United States in August 2000.  They were married in the United States in \nSeptember 2000.  Applicant does not speak Chinese and his wife\u2019s family does not \nspeak English.  Applicant communicates with his wife\u2019s family in the PRC through his \nwife.  Applicant admits he traveled to the PRC in March 2002, May 2001, June 2004, \nOctober 2005, November 2006, and January 2007.  His wife accompanied him on the \ntrips he made after they married in September 2000.  Applicant and his wife plan to \ntravel to the PRC in August 2008 to visit family and see the Olympics. (Tr. 14-16; \nGovernment Exhibit 1, Security Clearance Application (e-QIP) dated May 11, 2007) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she was born and raised in the PRC.  She received \na bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from a PRC university and worked for over \nten years as an electrical engineer for a PRC company.  She then worked for about four \nyears for the PRC Trade ministry buying and selling items for use by businesses in the \nPRC.  Just prior to meeting Applicant and coming to the United States, Applicant\u2019s wife \nand a friend opened a restaurant.  She is a citizen of the PRC but now a resident of the \nUnited States.  When she arrived in the United States with her new husband in 2000, \nshe started taking English language and other courses at a local community college.  \nShe became proficient enough in English that she applied for United States citizenship \nin May 2008.  (Tr. 22-25; Applicant Exhibit H, postal receipt, dated May 4, 2008)  \n \nHer father passed away in 2004.  He previously served for over 42 years in the \nPRC Army as a medical officer, retiring about 27 years ago.  He then went to work for a \nhospital.  Applicant met some PRC government officials on his visits to PRC because of \nthe military connections of his father-in-law. (Tr. 28-29) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother is 76 years old, a retired school teacher, and a resident \nand citizen of the PRC.  Her mother resides with Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister, and receives \nsome retirement and medical benefits from the PRC government.  Applicant and his \nwife provide her mother with about $1,200 a year in monetary support.  Applicant\u2019s wife \ntalks to her mother by telephone about once a month, and stays with her and her sister \non her visits to the PRC. (Tr. 26-28)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister is 44 years old, an accountant for a lighting supplier, not \nmarried, and lives with her mother.  Applicant\u2019s wife talks to her sister about once a \nmonth when she calls her mother.  Applicant\u2019s wife does not e-mail her sister.  Her \nsister has never visited the United States.  (Tr. 29-30)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother is 41 years old, married, and a department director for \nlicensing for the Beijing city government.  Applicant\u2019s wife does not speak to her brother \n\n \n4 \n \n \non the telephone and does not e-mail him.  She does see him on her visits to the PRC. \n(Tr. 30-32)   \n \nApplicant testified that he formed a business relationship with the United States \npatent holder and manufacturer of a piece of equipment for water treatment.  He \nbecame one of the manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives for the equipment.  After he \nand his wife married, they saw a lucrative market for the equipment in the PRC.  He \nsought and received some assistance from the United States State Department foreign \ncommerce service.  They assisted in arranging visits and appointments.  Applicant and \nhis wife entered a business relationship with two individuals in the PRC to assist and \nrepresent him to sell the water treatment devices.  He made about two or three trips to \nthe PRC meeting with his representatives and demonstrating the equipment for them \nand potential customers.  Some of the potential customers could have been government \nrepresentatives.  His wife served as his translator.  Applicant also made some business \narrangements with a representative to sell the equipment in Thailand.  For each piece of \nequipment sold, Applicant would receive a 5 percent commission and the \nrepresentatives 10 percent.  However, he has not sold any equipment to any entity in \nChina or Thailand.  He has not been to Thailand since 2004 for business or any other \nreason.  His business arrangements in the PRC were basically over in 2006.  He is \nwilling to travel to Thailand or the PRC if there is an opportunity for a lucrative sale of \nthe equipment.  However, Applicant does not foresee any business from his attempts to \nsell the water treatment equipment outside the United States.  He has sold some \nequipment to businesses in the United States. (Tr. 44-50) \n \nApplicant kept his supervisors informed of his travels to the PRC and his \nbusiness activities.  He informed his security manager that he has a foreign born wife.  \nWhen he met his wife and married her in 2000, he was employed by the Army.  He \ninformed his Army supervisors of his trips to the PRC.  He also informed them of his \nbusiness activities.  (Tr. 50-52; Applicant Exhibit F, Letters, dated October 29, 2004) \n \n \nChina, also known as the People's Republic of China, is hostile to the United \nStates, and has interests inimical to those of the U.S.  China is ruled by a totalitarian \ngovernment that depends on the suppression of its people. The government has a poor \nrecord of human rights that features, among other things, repression of political and \nreligious dissenters.  There have been some improvements in relations between PRC \nand the United States.  While the United States looks forward to a constructive and \nbroad-based relationship with China, a message reiterated by President Bush when he \nmet with PRC President Hu in April 2006, there are areas of potential disagreement.   \n \n \nChina is known to engage in espionage against the U.S., both economically, \nmilitarily, and otherwise.  The United States is a primary intelligence target of PRC \nbecause of the United States role as a global superpower; its substantial military, \npolitical, and economic presence in Asia and the Pacific Rim; its role as a developer of \nadvanced technology that China requires for economic growth; and the large number of \nAmericans of Chinese ancestry who are considered prime intelligence targets by the \nPRC.  The intelligence practice of the PRC is different from the Soviet and western \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcept of the use of recruited agents.  The western approach is to recruit agents for a \nspecific intelligence target.  The PRC intelligence philosophy is to try to recruit agents \nbefore there is a specific need, and recruit as many as possible.  The crux of the PRC \napproach is not to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability but to appeal to an individual\u2019s \ndesire to help China out in some ways.  A large portion of the PRC intelligence \ncollection efforts against common targets is conducted directly by PRC students, \ndelegations, and commercial enterprises.  They also believe if large numbers of PRC \npersonnel leave China and settle permanently in the United States, some of them may \nsome day find their way into positions of intelligence potential.  When they are in \nposition, these individuals will be approached on the basis of loyalty to their ancestral \nland, and some may be persuaded to cooperate, at least on a limited basis.  (Court \nExhibit 1, Government Request for Administrative Notice, Intelligence Threat Handbook, \nat 17-24) \n \n \nChinese security personnel place foreign visitors under surveillance and subject \nthem to search without their knowledge or consent.  However, there is no information in \nintelligence documents that the PRC is targeting relatives of Chinese-Americans to gain \naccess to classified, technical, or business information from their relatives in the United \nStates.  However in recent years, the PRC has been the subject of approximately half of \nthe cases initiated by U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning the illegal diversion of \ntechnology from the United States.  These cases involve people born and raised in the \nPRC who immigrated to the United States and became United States citizens.  The \nPRC relies on recruitment and exploitation operations.  The PRC attempts to recruit or \nat least \u201cmake friends with\u201d as many Chinese-Americans as possible, apparently hoping \nthat at least some will perceive an obligation to help China,  (Court Exhibit 1, Request \nfor Administrative Notice, attached State Department and Intelligence Service \ndocuments) \n \nThailand is a constitutional monarchy.  The democratically elected prime minister \nwas overthrown by a peaceful military coup in 2006.  The military regime abolished the \nparliament, declared martial law, and limited civil liberties.  Thailand has an open market \neconomy with significant foreign investments.  The United States has significant trade \nwith Thailand being its largest export market and second largest supplier.  There had \nbeen good relations between Thailand and the United States until the coup in \nSeptember 2006.  Since then, the United States has suspended several military \nexercises and operations with Thailand.  The Department of State has criticized the \nThai human rights record.  The Thai constitution prohibits torture and arbitrary arrest \nand detention.  However, since the September 2006 coup, there are reports of torture, \nand arbitrary arrest, detention, and disappearances.  There is also a concern for \nincreased terrorism in Southeast Asia, including Thailand.  There are incidents of \ncriminal and political violence by separatist and extremists groups generally focused on \ngovernment interests but increasingly targeting public places and tourist areas. (Court \nExhibit II) \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in the U.S. \ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests.  Adjudication \nunder this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which \nthe foreign contact or financial interest is location, including but not limited to, such \nconsideration as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife reside together in the United States, but his wife is still a \ncitizen of the PRC.  Applicant\u2019s wife has contact by telephone and visits with her \nmother, brother, and sister who are all citizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant \nsees his wife\u2019s family when he visits the PRC but otherwise has minimal contact with \nthem because they do not share a common language.  Applicant also has business \ncontacts in the PRC and Thailand.  His business interests and his wife\u2019s family contacts \nraise security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 7(a) \n(Contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion); AG \u00b6 7(b) (Connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup, or country by providing that information); and AG \u00b6 7(d) (sharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion). \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal Board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  (See, \nISCR Case No. 03-17620, App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006; ISCR Case No. 03-24933, App. Bd. \nJul. 28, 2005; ISCR Case No. 03-02382, App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005; and ISCR Case No. \n03-15205, App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to \napply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n \nThe nature of the country in which persons are located is an issue.  There are \nsome indications that China and the United States are working towards more friendly \nrelations.  There is no doubt that the PRC targets the United States for scientific, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nintelligence, technical, and military information.  While Thailand has been an ally of the \nUnited States, the military coup in September 2006 and the resulting government and \nterrorist activities raises concerns about Thai actions against United States citizens to \ngain trade and other protected information from the United States.  Security concerns \ncan be raised from countries both friendly and hostile to the United States.  The United \nStates has an interest to protect its classified information whether the person, \norganization, or country seeking the information has interests inimical to the United \nStates. (ISCR Case No. 02-11570, App. Bd. May 19, 2004 at 5)  Friendly countries can \nhave disagreements with the United States over matters that are vital to the national \nsecurity of the United States.  Friendly countries have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States while seeking economic, scientific, and technical information.  (ISCR \nCase No. 00-0317, App. Bd. May 29, 2002)  The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., its human rights record, and its intelligence collection \nmethods are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion.  The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is dependent on or associated with the government, or the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the U.S.  Applicant has a heavy burden to \nestablish that PRC and Thailand do not create a security concern. \n \n \nI have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.); AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could created a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with the PRC are through his wife and her family.  He does \nnot have any relatives or family members in the PRC, but his wife does.  Applicant\u2019s \ndirect contacts with his wife\u2019s family are minimal since he does not speak their language \nand they do not speak his language.  There is a rebuttable presumption that an \napplicant has ties of obligation to members of his spouse\u2019s family. (ISCR Case No. 01-\n03120 (App. Bd. February 20, 2002 at 8))  His wife\u2019s family in the PRC and her contacts \nwith them are attributed to Applicant.  Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s talks to her mother and sister \nmonthly and has visited yearly since she came to the United States with Applicant in \n2000.  Her contacts with them are not casual and are frequent so FI MC \u00b6 8(c) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother is a retired school teacher and her sister an accountant \nfor a private company.  Her mother receives a pension through the PRC government.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe mother and sister are ordinary citizens leading normal lives in the PRC.  Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s brother is a mid-level bureaucrat for the Beijing city government.  Even though \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s father is deceased, he was a member of the PRC army for many \nyears and she has contacts with officials because of his service.  She is also a PRC \ncitizen even though she resides now in the United States.  The government documents \nused for administrative notice purposes show that the PRC approach to intelligence \ngathering is different than the western approach.  The PRC does not normally target \npeople, like Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family members, to pressure, or coerce Applicant to \nreveal information not in the United States interests.  In balancing the nature of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts and visits with his wife\u2019s family and her contacts with her relatives \nin the PRC with the intelligence approach of the PRC, I determine that Applicant is not \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by the PRC, merely because of the location of his \nwife\u2019s family in the PRC. \n \n \nThe PRC approach to intelligence gathering does seem to target individuals of \nChinese ancestry in the United States.  The administrative judge must again balance \nthe nature of the loyalty of the individual to the United States against his loyalty to family \nin the PRC.  In this case, Applicant has a strong sense of loyalty to the United States.  \nHe has worked for many years for the United States government and has held a \nsecurity clearance for over 20 years.  His contacts with the PRC are through his wife.  \nThis is balanced against his wife\u2019s connections to the PRC.  His wife has been in the \nUnited States for only about eight years, but she has applied to be a United States \ncitizen.  In the PRC, she was an engineer and a business owner.  She returns yearly to \nvisit her family in the PRC, and talks to them monthly.  Her father was a high ranking \nArmy official for many years.  Her brother is a government official of the capital of the \nPRC.  She has strong ties of loyalty to the PRC.  While her loyalty to the United States \nmay be growing, her loyalty to the PRC is still strong.  Applicant has not established that \nhis wife\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the PRC is outweighed by her growing loyalty \nto the United States.   \n \n \nA conflict of interest in this case is likely for Applicant through his wife.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife could be approached or pressured by the PRC for information from her \nhusband based on the PRC approach to intelligence gathering.  I am satisfied of \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States.  But the nature of his wife\u2019s loyalty is such that a \nconflict with his wife loyalty and obligation to the PRC can be expected which will place \nApplicant in a position to have to choose between his loyalty to his wife and her family \nand his loyalty to the United States.  Applicant has not established that he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest caused by his wife in favor of the United \nStates interest.  Accordingly, Applicant has not met his heavy burden to show that his \nwife and her contacts in the PRC are not a security concern for him.  I conclude that FI \nMC AGs, \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b), are not established. \n \n \n \nGuideline L, Outside Activities \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of security \nconcern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s security responsibilities and \ncould create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  (AG \n\u00b6 36)  Applicant\u2019s water treatment equipment business interests in China and Thailand \nraise Outside Activities Disqualifying Conditions (OA DC) \u00b6 37(a) any employment or \nservice, whether compensated or volunteer, with: (1) the government of a foreign \ncountry; (2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity; and (3) a representative \nof any foreign interest; and \u00b6 37(b) (failure to report or fully disclose an outside activity \nwhen this is required). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s outside activities are based on his role of serving as a sales or \nmanufacturer\u2019s representative in the PRC and Thailand for a United States \nmanufacturer of water treatment equipment.  He has engaged the services of \nrepresentatives in the PRC and Thailand to generate business for him and the \nmanufacturer.  Applicant has been unsuccessful in generating business during the four \nto six years of his endeavors.  He has, however, generated business in the United \nStates.  Applicant kept his supervisors informed of all of his foreign contacts and \nactivities.  Applicant has not received compensation from a foreign country or entity.  He \nrepresents a United States manufacturer and not a foreign business.  He reported all of \nhis activities to his supervisors.  I conclude that the Outside Activities disqualifying \nconditions have not been established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has strong ties to his wife \nwho has strong ties to her family in the PRC.  Applicant has strong loyalties to the \nUnited States, which is offset by his wife\u2019s ties of loyalty to the PRC.  His outside \nbusiness activities in the PRC and Thailand do not cause a security concern because \nthey are with a United States manufacturer and have not been successful.  Overall, on \nbalance the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n11 \n \n \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline L:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 62 years old and has been employed as an unexploded ordnance\ntechnician by defense contractors since January 2006. The certificates and letters of\nrecommendation he submitted establish he has performed his duties in a commendable\nfashion.\nApplicant listed employment outside the defense industry in the security clearance\napplication he submitted in 2007 as the director of operations for an investment firm from\nApril 1996 to February 1998, the vice president of operations for a corporation from\nFebruary 1998 to March 1999, the customer service lead for an electronics warehouse\nfrom August 2003 to May 2004, security for a homeowners\u2019 association from April 2004 to\nAugust 2005, and the assistant director of security for a community association from\nSeptember 2005 to January 2006. Applicant was also the president of his own business\nengaged peripherally in the motion picture business from March 1999 to August 2003.\nApplicant served on active duty with the Air Force from June 1963 to May 1967. He\nattained the rank of Staff Sergeant (paygrade E-5) and his service was characterized as\n\u201cHonorable.\u201d He served on active duty with the Army from February 1978 to April 1987. He\nattained the rank of Sergeant First Class (paygrade E-7). His military decorations include\nthe Army Good Conduct Medal (3  award), Army Achievement Medal, Army\nrd\nCommendation Medal, and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal. Applicant served as a\nMorse Intercept Operator in the Air Force. He served as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal\nSpecialist in the Army. Applicant possessed a security clearance and was granted various\nhigh level security accesses while in the armed forces. No prior adverse action is reported\nto have been taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance or any granted access.\nApplicant has been married since January 1978. In the 2007 security clearance\napplication he submitted, Applicant reported two prior marriages that ended in divorce in\nor about 1969 and in or about 1972. He did not provide any other information about these\nmarriages. He did not list any children from any of his marriages.    \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent accounts, totaling $17,314, that have been\nsubmitted for collection, and four delinquent accounts, totaling $29,472, that have been\ncharged off as bad debts. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was\npersonally responsible for two of the collection accounts, totaling $299, although he also\n\n The record does not contain any evidence to explain how or from whom the credit reporting agencies\n3\nobtained assertions that Applicant had died.  \n3\nalleged they had been paid without providing any proof of payment either with his response\nor at the hearing. He also admitted the business he operated from 1999 to 2003 was\nresponsible for three of the charged off accounts and one of the collection accounts,\ntotaling $36,373. Finally, he indicated he was disputing the remaining accounts. His\ntestimony and the information he provided in response to interrogatories propounded to\nhim by the DOHA (GE 2), indicate the basis for his disputing those accounts is that he does\nnot recognize the creditors. \nThe business related accounts consist of a delinquent credit card debt and\ndeficiencies owing on two automobiles and a boat he allowed to be voluntarily repossessed\nwhen the business failed. While he asserts the business was incorporated and the debts\nwere corporate liabilities that should have been solely the responsibility of the corporation,\nhe did not submit any proof to substantiate those assertions. To the contrary, Applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports (GE 2 & 3) list those debts as being either individual or joint debts with the\nsole exception of the entry of \u201cParticipant\u201d in the credit report contained in GE 2 for the\ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.f.\nApplicant also suggests his financial problems may be the result of possible identity\ntheft as evidenced by a letter he received in August 2006 from the Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA) indicating personal information of up to 26.5 million veterans may have been\ncompromised by the theft of a computer. However, most if not all of the debts alleged in\nthe SOR predate the letter by years and could not have resulted from the theft of his\nidentity as a result of that theft. Further, Applicant admits all but five of the debts are either\nhis personal responsibility or the responsibility of his former business. \nApplicant also suggests that entries in the credit report contained in GE 2 that\nindicate he is deceased somehow contribute to his financial problems.  Other than his\n3\ntestimony that he has had difficulty contesting those entries he disputes in his credit\nreports, it is unclear how the obviously inaccurate entries about his death could have\ncontributed to his financial problems. Most significantly, they could not have contributed in\nany way to the debts he admits he and/or his former business are responsible for and his\nunwillingness or inability to resolve those debts.     \nApplicant testified he contacted the creditors of his former business in an effort to\nresolve those debts but was unable to make the payments they insisted on. He also\ntestified his bank refused to give him a loan to pay off those debts because he reportedly\nwas deceased. However, he was able to clear up the reports of his death sufficiently to\nobtain a mortgage loan to purchase a house. Finally, he submitted a letter from an\nattorney, dated March 17, 2008, who reported he is working to clear up the issue of\nApplicant being listed as deceased by the various credit reporting agencies.

Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id. at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n5\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant has numerous debts, totalling more than $46,000, that have been\ndelinquent for many years and either charged off as bad debts or submitted for collection.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC\n19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant admits he is personally responsible for two small debts which he claims\nto have paid. However, he did not provide any verification of the alleged payments. He\nadmits over $36,000 of the delinquent debt arose from his former business endeavor.\nWhile he asserts that debt should have been corporate debt for which he should not be\nheld personally liable, he failed to provide any evidence in support of that assertion.\nApplicant sought the assistance of an attorney to clear up the issue of his reported death\nin the credit reports as evidenced by a letter dated March 17, 2008, but has not actually\naccomplished anything to resolve the issue. He also claims to have contacted the creditors\non the business debt and sought a bank loan in unsuccessful efforts to resolve that debt.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to take any meaningful action to resolve the numerous debts that\nhave been delinquent for years prohibits application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the\nbehavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC\n20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances; MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts.  \nAlthough Applicant claims to not recognize several of the creditors listed in the SOR,\nhe presented no meaningful basis to conclude they are not his debts that have been sold\n\n6\nto successor creditors. Accordingly, I conclude MC 20(e): the individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue has no applicability to the facts of this case. The remaining\nmitigating condition is also inapplicable. \n  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him\nnor  satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nOn January 8, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 25, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 27, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On June 3, 2008, Department \nOctober 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing eight Items, and \nmailed Applicant a complete copy on June 17, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on \nOctober 2, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. On October 16, 2008, Applicant submitted a letter that I marked \nas Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. On October 21, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to me. \nAfter reviewing AE A, I admitted it into the record over Department Counsel\u2019s objection. \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel requested withdrawal of SOR \u00b6 1.b because \nthe $81 debt was paid prior to the issuance of the SOR. Said request is granted.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.d, and offered explanations. He denied the allegation contained in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n  \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He divorced in May 2005 and has two children. Since \n1983, he has worked as a lab technician for a federal contractor. In that same year he \nwas investigated for a Secret security clearance.  (Item 5).  When he completed the e-\nQIP in January 2007, he disclosed financial delinquencies, a foreclosure and a \ngarnishment for his wife\u2019s hospital bills. (Id. at 18-19). \n \n \nPrior to the issuance of the SOR, Applicant completed a set of Financial \nInterrogatories related to his finances.  He indicated that he spoke to someone about \nthe pending foreclosure and was told that it could take up to ten years for any final \naction to be completed. He noted he could withdraw monies from his 401(k) to satisfy \nthe debt, if necessary. His wife was responsible for the $1,054 debt owed to a credit \ncard company. No information was requested or given about the $1,980 debt owed to \nthe same company. (Item 6 at 3-4). \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated February 8, 2007, and October 31, \n2007, the SOR alleges three delinquent debts, totaling $25,977. All three were joint \naccounts, held by Applicant and his wife, which started to become delinquent in mid-\n2002. These debts remain unpaid or unresolved. \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a lists a $23,015 mortgage account balance that was past due as of \nJuly 2002. Subsequently, a foreclosure proceeding began in May 2003 per \nthe e-QIP.  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.c lists a $1,054 balance owed to a credit card company, as of \nDecember 2002. \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.d lists a $1,908 balance owed to the above credit card company, as \nof December 2002. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his wife was responsible for \npaying the household bills during the marriage. After separating, he became aware of \nthe financial problems. Upon their divorce in 2005, he learned that she had taken \n$10,000 of his money. He also thought she was responsible for paying the credit card \ncompany according to the divorce agreement. Again, he indicated that he could pay the \nmortgage balance with funds in his 401(k). (Item 4 at 4). \n \n \nIn responding to the FORM, Applicant noted that after he and his wife separated \nhe could no longer afford the mortgage on his income. He tried to negotiate a resolution \nwith the mortgagor, but was unable. He also tried to contact the credit card company but \ncould not locate them. He considered filing bankruptcy and decided against it. Other \nthan those three debts, he is otherwise in good financial shape. (AE A). \n \n \nAccording to his budget, Applicant has a net monthly income of $2,200 and \nexpenses of $885, leaving $1,135. His assets included $115,000 in a 401(k). (Item 4 at \n5). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, The applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19, two of them are potentially disqualifying: \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on two CBRs and his admissions, Applicant has been unable or unwilling \nto satisfy debts that began accruing in July 2002. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese two disqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. The guideline \nincludes six examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies have been ongoing since 2002. Hence, AG \u00b6 \n2 (a) does not apply. Some of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are attributable to his \ndivorce and a reduction of his income, which was a circumstance beyond his control. \nHowever, there is no evidence in the record indicating that he responsibly managed his \nfinances during those difficult periods, which is necessary for full application of this \nmitigating condition. Thus, AG & 20(b) has limited application.  Applicant did not present \nany evidence that he received credit counseling, or that the three delinquent debts are \nresolved or under control, as required under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not initiated \nrepayment of the three debts; hence, AG & 20(d) does not apply. There is no evidence \nindicating that he disputed any of the debts, which is required under AG & 20(e). The \nrecord does not support the application of AG & 20(f). \n  \n Whole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 46 years old and has \nworked for a federal contractor for more than thirty. When he completed his e-QIP in \nJanuary 2007, he disclosed a foreclosure that began in May 2003. Although he learned \nof the Government\u2019s concerns about his finances in November 2007, he did not take \nany action to resolve the concerns. In February 2008, he again received notice of the \nconcerns and did not take steps or submit information that the matters were resolved. \nWithout such proof, there is insufficient information in the record to mitigate the financial \nconcerns. His failure to address the issues over the past couple years, raises questions \nabout his judgment.  \n \n  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on April 1, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on April 25,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 13, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on June 5, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex) 1 through 6,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and\nsubmitted Exhibits A through G, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr) on June 17, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open\n\n2\nuntil June 13, 2008, to submit additional documents.  She timely submitted a cover\nletter, and three additional documents, which have been marked collectively as Exhibit\nH, and entered into evidence without objection. The record closed on June 13, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nDepartment Counsel indicated in her opening statement that the Government\nwas withdrawing the allegations listed under Guideline B (Tr at 17).  Therefore the\nallegations that are listed under Guideline B will not be discussed or have any influence\non this decision.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1. a., b., c., d., e., j., and m.\nShe denied 1. f, g., h., I., k., l., and n. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 22 years old. She is engaged to be married and she has one child.\nShe is a high school graduate with some college.\nApplicant is employed as a security administrator by a defense contractor, and\nshe seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nsector.\nThe SOR lists 14 allegations (1.a. through 1.n.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order\nas they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,642.\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that the total amount of this debt is still unpaid.\n1.b. This overdue debt also to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$3,038. In her RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the\nhearing, Applicant testified that, although she is attempting to negotiate a payment plan\nto resolve this debt, at this time, the total amount of this debt is still unpaid,\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $62. In\nher RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that the total amount of this debt is still unpaid.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $830.36.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she had made an arrangement with the creditor to\n\n3\nsettle this debt for a one time payment of $499. However, she never made the payment\nand the debt is still outstanding. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $11,593.\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that the total amount of this debt is still unpaid.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $226.  At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that she had resolved this debt with a payment of $100.\nSince she had no evidence of this payment, the record was held open to allow Applicant\nto submit proof of payment. Exhibit H includes a letter from this creditor, dated January\n15, 2008, which shows that a payment was made of $100 on this account, and there is\nnow a $0 balance on this debt.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $391.  In\nher RSOR, Applicant denied that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that she was unaware of the basis of this debt, although she has not challenged\nor disputed this bill with any credit reporting agency. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $176.\nApplicant testified that this debt was as a result of a fraud perpetrated on her by another\nindividual and that she is disputing this debt. Exhibit G is a credit report that includes 19\ndebts that were disputed by Applicant, including this debt. While some of the debts were\ndeleted as a result of this dispute, the credit reporting agency shows that this debt was\nverified with no change. Therefore this debt is still due and owing a this time. \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $201. In\nher RSOR, Applicant denied that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that she was unaware of the basis of this debt, although she has not challenged\nit with any credit reporting agency. \n1.J. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $880. In\nher RSOR, Applicant admitted that this allegation is correct. However, at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that she has not made any payment on this debt, because she does\nnot believe she should have received this bill. However, she has done nothing to dispute\nthis bill with the collection agency or any credit reporting agency. \n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,358.\nIn her RSOR, Applicant denied that this allegation is correct. However, at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that she has a debt consolidator who is attempting to negotiate a\nsettlement of this debt, but at this time the total amount of this debt is still unpaid.  \n \n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $74. In\nher RSOR, Applicant denied that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that she is current with this creditor. Exhibit H includes an invoice from this\ncreditor, showing that Applicant made a payment of $100 as of April 23, 2008, but there\nis still an amount owing of $172.62.\n\n4\n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $86.\nIn her RSOR, Applicant denied that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that she received this bill as a result of a parking ticket in error since\nshe has a legitimate placard allowing her to park in a handicapped parking space. When\nshe contacted the creditor, she was informed that if she sent a copy of a printout\nshowing she had an active handicap placard the debt would be eliminated. However,\nApplicant testified that she has not sent the letter to resolve this debt, because she has\nnot had any time since November 2007 to resolve this debt.  I find that at this time this\ndebt is still owed, since Applicant has not taken the time and made the effort to resolve\nit.  \n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $486.\nIn her RSOR, Applicant denied that this allegation is correct, and at the hearing,\nApplicant testified that she received this bill as a result of identity theft. In Exhibit H,\nApplicant submitted a letter that she wrote indicating that she had contacted a\nrepresentative from this creditor explaining that an investigation is now being conducted\non this account. \nApplicant testified that her financial difficulties primarily began when she was 19\nand 20, and did not act in a financially responsible manner. She testified that she is not\noverdue on any of her current debts. She did purchase a vehicle in November 2007 in\nthe amount of $13,000, and she has been making payments of $397 a month. \nApplicant submitted a confirmation agreement, signed by Applicant on February\n5, 2008,  from a consumer crediting agency, attached to her RSOR, that Applicant\ntestified is attempting to help her resolve her overdue debts. However, no\ndocumentation was submitted, nor did Applicant have any information, as to whether\nthis company had done anything to resolve any of her debts.  \nFinally, Applicant did submit a very positive performance evaluation from her\ncurrent employer (Exhibit A) and a certificate of Congratulations for her \u201coutstanding\nsupport\u201d in her current employment (Exhibit E).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n5\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \n\n6\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \nl do not find any of the mitigating conditions is a factor for consideration in this\ncase. While Applicant seems to be more financially sound and better prepared for future\ncontingencies, she still has not resolved a great deal of overdue debt. I therefore\nconclude that until she is able to significantly reduce her overdue debt, she has not\nmitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition\napplies, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant  questions and doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.n.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 4, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the response on January 9, \n2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 5, 2008, and I \nreceived the case assignment on February 14, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non February 21, 2008, scheduling the hearing for March 13, 2008.  The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through M, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 21 2008.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing \u00b6 1.c., which \nalleged an allegation under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.

Tr. 7-8. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted in his response to the \nSOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He graduated from high school in June 1974, and \nestimates he has completed 95 credit hours towards his bachelor\u2019s degree. Tr. 17, GE \nA. He married his spouse in August 1975. He and his wife have two adult daughters, \nages 31 and 26. Applicant has been working for his current defense contractor \nemployer since June 2007, where he is employed as a facilities manager for information \ntechnology (IT) services. As such he is responsible for overseeing IT services for 26 \ncompany offices throughout the U.S. Tr. 17, 43. His present company purchased his \nformer company where was employed from June 2004 to June 2007 as the senior \nmanager of administrative services. Tr. 17, 44-45, GE 1. \n \n \nApplicant previously held a security clearance from 1980 to 1994, which was \ninitially granted as a secret clearance and upgraded to a top secret clearance. During \nthat time-frame, he was employed as his company\u2019s facility security officer from 1986-\n1992. He seeks a security clearance in conjunction with his current duties as a facilities \nmanager for IT services. Tr. 46-48.  \n \n \nAfter getting married in 1975, Applicant went to work for the Post Office as a mail \ncarrier. Tr. 34. At the time he was arrested, discussed below, he was on disability after \nsustaining a back injury. Tr. 34-35.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nIn November 1977, Applicant was arrested and charged with attempted robbery, \nwhich was later changed to assault with intent to rob. He was convicted of this charge \npursuant to his guilty plea in December 1978, and sentenced to eight years \nconfinement, of which five years was suspended. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \n \nIn December 1977, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony abduction \nand indecent exposure. He was convicted of these charges pursuant to his guilty pleas \nin April 1978. He was sentenced to eight years confinement for the felony abduction \ncharge, of which five years was suspended, and sentenced to twelve months \nconfinement for the indecent exposure charge. The sentences for all of these charges \nran concurrently. He was incarcerated approximately two years as a result of these \nsentences. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) GE 2, GE 3. \n \n \nAt the time he was arrested, Applicant was 22 years old, on a reduced salary as \na result of being on disability, and was taking medication for back pain. In November \n1977, he had entered several apartments looking for valuables and was caught by an \noccupant as he attempted to steal a purse. In the course of trying to escape, he threw \nthe occupant down and forgot to take the purse in the process. Tr. 37-38. The next \nmonth in December 1977, he attempted to grab a woman from behind as she was \ngetting off an elevator. As noted above, these offenses resulted in two separate arrests. \n \n \nDescribing his time in prison, Applicant stated: \n \nWell, being away from my family I think was perhaps the most difficult \nthing I\u2019ve ever faced. If a person, when they go to prison \u2013 I think you have \nto make a choice, and you have to make a choice that you\u2019re either going \nto turn yourself around, or you\u2019re going to continue to go down the path of \nwhat you were put there for. And nothing is more eye-opening than a \nreality check of being locked in a cell, being deprived of your rights, being \ndeprived of holding your children, holding your wife, or being with the \npeople you love. \n \nI swore to myself that I would never go back to jail. That I would totally turn \nmy life around, which I think I have. And that I would make a difference. \nJust because you go to jail doesn\u2019t mean that \u2013 pardon the phrase \u2013 that \nyou\u2019re the scum of the earth. People do change. Not everybody who goes \nto prison does, but I made a decision that when I got out that I would be \ndifferent and that I would make it up to my family by being the best that I \npossible could, for myself and for them. Tr. 24-25. \n \nWhile in prison, Applicant was detailed to housekeeping duties and maintaining \nthe grounds. He sometimes worked in the fields harvesting peas and sweet potatoes, \nand fed pigs. Toward the end of his confinement, he was a trustee performing janitorial \nduties and painting the jail. Tr. 42. \n \nTo demonstrate his commitment to being the best that he could be, he became a \nmodel employee, and a committed family man. He was an active member of his local \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nParent Teacher Association, of which he was president for four years, was active in his \ndaughters\u2019 Girl Scout Troops for 17 years where he served as a Troop Leader and \nService Unit Manager, and was involved in a number of community activities such as \nschool fund raisers. Tr. 14, 30, 54. Applicant\u2019s wife worked for her state\u2019s department of \nmotor vehicle office for 19 years, and resigned about 18 months ago to provide full-time \ncare for her aunt who was disabled and recently passed away. Tr. 51-52. Applicant and \nhis wife are in the process of purchasing their third home. \n \nApplicant\u2019s older daughter graduated from college and was employed as a social \nworker until she became a stay-at-home mother where she takes care of her two young \nchildren. Applicant\u2019s younger daughter is attending college full-time and is studying to \nbecome a teacher. Tr. 50-51.  \n \nApplicant submitted four work-related letters of reference, which described \nApplicant as an \u201cexceptional employee,\u201d \u201cperformance . . . characterized by capability, \npunctuality, efficiency, thoroughness, and the ability to work with other people who may \nhave different priorities,\u201d \u201chard work,\u201d \u201cdedication and commitment,\u201d \u201cvery honest and \nstraight forward,\u201d and [b]eing of the highest integrity.\u201d AE B, AE J, AE K, AE L. Applicant \nsubmitted one personal letter of reference from a former girl scout service unit manager \nwho described Applicant as \u201ca loyal and capable worker\u201d whose \u201ccommitment never \nwavered.\u201d AE M. Applicant submitted three work performance evaluations from past and \npresent employers reflecting above average performance. AE D, AE G, AE I. He also \nsubmitted 12 certificates of training for various courses he attended spanning his \nworking career. AE C, AE E, AE F, AE H. \n \nAppellant emphasized that he has learned from his mistake, and has previously \nheld a clearance for 14 years with no other incidents.  Because the personnel close to \nhim are aware of the incident, it could not be used to coerce or improperly influence \nhim. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d1 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).2 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the \ncontrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, \nand the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n2 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both \nfavorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in \nlight of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met \nhis burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d  Pursuant to his guilty pleas, Applicant was convicted of \nassault with intent to rob, felony abduction, and indecent exposure, and served \napproximately two years in prison. These offenses warrant application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) \nand 31(c). \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 31(c) do not apply. Applicant guilty pleas and acceptance of \nresponsibility for committing these crimes precludes application of these mitigating \nfactors. \n \nHowever, a review of the facts and available evidence warrants application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d). For the last 28 years since Applicant was released from prison, he \nhas been a model citizen. His words of saying he has been successfully rehabilitated \nhave been substantiated by action. He has been a model employee, husband, and \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nfather. He and his wife have successfully raised two responsible adult daughters, who \nare productive members of society. His employment record supports the notion that he \nhas earned the trust and confidence of his employers. Applicant has been placed in \ntrusted management positions and earned favorable reviews. Notably, he was \nsuccessfully vetted for a security clearance in 1980. He was granted a clearance initially \nat the secret level, which was later upgraded to the top secret level. He held that \nclearance for 14 years without any reported security violations. \n \nApplicant successfully integrated into his community. He served 17 years with his \ndaughters\u2019 Girl Scout Troops in leadership capacities, volunteered in the Parent \nTeacher Association where he served as President, and was involved in other \ncommunity activities. He and his wife are in the process of purchasing their third home. \nHe is a responsible and productive member of society as documented by his letters of \nreference, work performance evaluations, and testimonial evidence.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.   \n \nThe evidence weighing against Applicant is the conviction of three serious crimes \ndiscussed above in 1978. However, since his release from prison 28 years ago, \nApplicant has made every effort to overcome his past record.   \nApplicant earned approximately 95 college semester hours. He has been \ngainfully employed since his release from prison 28 years, and has held several \nsuccessful management positions, the most recent being facilities manager for IT \nservices. His record of good employment weighs in his favor. This shows responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. He has proven himself as a husband, father, and member \nof the community. Applicant also has a 14-year proven track record of having \nsuccessfully held a security clearance without incident.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \n  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to criminal conduct.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.b.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nRobert J. Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n3See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 22, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan e-QIP version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On January \n22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge \nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nJune 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 29, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, notarized February 17, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on March 13, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard on March 20, 2008. \nOn March 27, 2008, because of caseload considerations, it was reassigned to me. A \nNotice of Hearing was issued on March 31, 2008, and I convened the hearing, as \nscheduled, on May 6, 2008. During the hearing, three Government exhibits and four \nApplicant exhibits were received without objection, and Applicant testified. The \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on May 14, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.f., 1.h., 1.j., 1.m. through 1.o., 1.q. through 1.s., 1.v. through 1.x., and 1.z. \nthrough 1.bb., of the SOR, with explanations.  He failed to address \u00b6 1.cc., and denied \nthe remaining allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as a senior \nhelp desk analyst in network administration,1 and he is seeking to retain a SECRET \nsecurity clearance. He was initially granted such clearance in 1988.2 He was married to \nhis first wife from 1981 until 1986, when they divorced, and has been married to his \ncurrent wife since 1990.  He has five children.3 \n \nApplicant served on active duty with the U.S. Army for over 15 years, with five \nmonths service in Southwest Asia during hostilities in 1991.4  He declined further \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)/Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86), dated Feb. 22, 2007), at 14. \n  \n2 Id. at 46. \n \n3 Tr. at 47. \n \n4 Applicant Exhibit A (Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated Apr. 14, \n2000). \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nmilitary service to avoid a second overseas deployment in 2000,5 and was given an \nhonorable discharge.6 \n \nThere was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until about November \n1997, when, with an approved VA guaranteed loan of $176,128, he closed on a new \nhome.7  One month later, his wife was laid off from her job.8 Since her salary covered \nthe majority of their monthly expenses, his salary as an enlisted man, along with her \nunemployment checks, were insufficient to meet the family obligations.9 Creditors were \nunwilling to negotiate new payment arrangements, and bills eventually became \ndelinquent.  His wife did manage to secure a position in April 1998. Nevertheless, in \nOctober 1998, Applicant\u2019s debts, other than his residential mortgage loan, were \ndischarged under Chapter 7 backruptcy.10 \n \nFor an extended period thereafter, Applicant\u2019s wife experienced periodic periods \nof brief employment and unemployment.  The job she obtained in April 1998 lasted until \nJune 1999, and she remained unemployed until December 1999.  In April 2000, his \nenlistment with the Army ended and he immediately entered the ranks of the \nunemployed.11 Unable to pay their mortgage, they relocated to an apartment and rented \ntheir home.

Applicant \ndiscussed his plight with his security officer and was referred to what Applicant \ncharacterized as \u201cdebt counseling.\u201d19 In fact, it was a one day session on budget \ncounseling conducted on February 12, 2008,20 after receipt of the SOR.  Purportedly, as \na result of what he learned from the counseling, Applicant decided to not address his \nfinancial delinquencies because the delinquent balance was quite large and the debts \nwould be removed from his credit reports after seven years from the date of the last \nactivity.21  \n \nDuring the periods of their respective employment, unemployment, and \nunderemployment, Applicant and his wife attended educational institutions to improve \ntheir marketability for higher paying positions, and now each owes approximately \n$48,000 in student loans.22 His wife obtained her Bachelors and Masters degrees, and \nis currently working on her Ph.D.23 Applicant completed his B.S. in Information \nTechnology in 2005, and his M.S. in the same discipline in March 2008.24 \n \nApplicant and his wife both currently hold good positions that pay well.25  \nAccording to his comments made during an interview in April 2007, they had a \ncombined gross monthly income of $10,971, which worked out to a net income of nearly \n$9,000.26 After deducting approximately $8,000 in monthly expenses, including $1,118 \nfor martial arts and music for the children, $890 for day care, and $909 for car \n \n17 Id. \n \n18 Id. at 2-3, 5. \n \n19 Id. at 5. \n \n20 Certificate of Completion, Budget Counseling, dated Feb. 12, 2008, attached to Answer to SOR, supra \nnote 7. \n \n21 Answer to SOR, supra note 7, at 5. \n \n22 Tr. at 39. \n \n23 Id. at 37; Answer to SOR, supra note 7, at 6. \n \n24 Id. \n \n25 Tr. at 37. \n \n26 Personal Subject Interview, dated Apr. 18, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 2 (Answers to \nInterrogatories, dated Nov. 14, 2007). \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nexpenses, he generally has less than $40 remaining for discretionary spending.27 \nApplicant drives a 2005 Ford Explorer and his wife drives a 2005 Ford Expedition for \nwhich they pay $600 and $500, respectively, each month.28 \n \nThe SOR contained 29 allegations and identified 27 purportedly continuing \ndelinquencies, including some duplicates.

Quite to the contrary, his inaction \ntowards his delinquent debts and his continuing efforts in avoiding contact with his \ncreditors so as not to interfere with the removal of such debts from his credit report after \nseven years of inactivity, support his newly stated intention that he will not satisfy his \ndelinquent financial obligations.31  Over a period of about 10 years Applicant obtained \nservices and goods from a wide variety of creditors. While there were periods of \neconomic difficulty brought about by unemployment and underemployment, there were \nalso periods of prosperity, and Applicant has continuously ignored even the smallest of \nhis financial obligations. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n                                                          \n29 Personal Subject Interview, supra note 26. \n \n30 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 43-44.  \n \n31 Tr. at 53. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d32 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \n32 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial condition collapsed in December 1997, when his \nwife first lost her job. Although he remained on active duty until April 2000, his salary \nand her unemployment checks were insufficient to meet the family obligations, and bills \neventually became delinquent. In October 1998, Applicant\u2019s debts, other than his \nresidential mortgage loan, were discharged under Chapter 7 backruptcy.  That enabled \nthem to start all over with a clean financial slate.  Nevertheless, for an extended period \nof time, or until they were both fully employed in September 2003, more financial \nobligations were created only to, again, become delinquent because of his inability to \nsatisfy them. \n \nCommencing in September 2003, and continuing until this date, Applicant and \nhis wife have both been gainfully employed and currently earn a combined gross \nmonthly income of $10,971. What was purportedly a willingness, accompanied by an \ninability, to satisfy debts, became more clearly an ability, accompanied by an \nunwillingness, to satisfy them.  Applicant\u2019s clear intention is to ignore all his debts until \nsuch time as they are removed from his credit report.  AG && 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial situation collapsed in December 1997, but was restored with his bankruptcy in \nOctober 1998. Thereafter, he continued to accumulate substantial delinquent debt due, \nin large measure, to lengthy and sporadic unemployment and underemployment. The \nsporadic unemployment and underemployment circumstances are no longer present, \nand both he and his wife have been gainfully employed since September 2003. His \nrefusal to address his financial delinquencies over the past five years raises concerns \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nabout recurrence of delinquent debts and his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. The evidence fails to establish AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ As noted above, the financial problems arose initially \nbecause of his wife\u2019s unemployment in December 1997.  But Applicant\u2019s situation was \nseemingly resolved when most of his debts were discharged in bankruptcy in October \n1998.  His discharge from the Army and subsequent unemployment and his wife\u2019s \nperiodic unemployment and underemployment, only exacerbated his financial \ndifficulties. He acted irresponsibly when he became unemployed and then refused to \nresolve his debts. His continuing refusal to satisfy even the smallest of his delinquent \nobligations since 2003, even though he and his wife are gainfully employed, tarnishes \nhis actions as irresponsible. While the evidence regarding the period 1997-2003 initially \nestablished AG \u00b6 20(a), the evidence of events since 2003 vitiates the applicability of \nthis mitigating condition.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@33 In February 2008, after receipt of the SOR, Applicant \nattended a budget counseling seminar. He decided to not address his financial \ndelinquencies because the delinquent balance was quite large and the debts would be \nremoved from his credit reports after seven years from the date of the last activity. In \nfact, that decision was clearly made after he and his wife became employed in 2003, \nand he failed to make any effort to address his debts.  In this instance, the budget \ncounseling is insufficient to establish that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol.  And, there is no credible evidence Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.  The evidence fails to establish \nAG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \n \n33 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s extensive financial delinquencies, which continue \nunaddressed, his focus on obtaining educational degrees, and his significant spending \nof discretionary funds for everything but his overdue debts, Applicant has not \ndemonstrated his financial responsibility.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was an active duty member of the U.S. Army and his wife was employed. She \nlost her job and entered periodic periods of employment and unemployment.  Unable to \nmeet the family financial obligations, in October 1998, his debts were discharged in \nbankruptcy. Intending to avoid another overseas tour, he left military service and \nbecame unemployed. He also endured periods of employment and unemployment.  \nWhile their underemployment and unemployment are circumstances beyond their \ncontrol, Applicant obtained services and goods from a wide variety of creditors, but \neither had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he accumulated extensive \nnew delinquent debt.  (See AG & 2(a)(1) and AG & 2(a)(2).)  Applicant and his wife \nhave been gainfully employed since 2003, and while their combined gross monthly \nincome is $10,971, he has refused to make any good-faith efforts to pay a variety of \ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Instead, he preferred to wait for the debts to drop \noff his credit report after seven years of inactivity. (See AG & 2(a)(6), AG & 2(a)(7), and \nAG & 2(a)(9).) While these debts may eventually become uncollectible, failure to repay \ncreditors reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(a)(5).) \n  \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether \nhis financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \nI am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ncredit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in \nlight of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.34 Considering what Applicant had gone through financially and emotionally \nduring 1998-2003, and mindful of his 1998 bankruptcy, subsequent clean slate, the \nabsence of any good-faith efforts, and his continuing refusal to address his debts, his \ncurrent financial situation is sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. (See AG & \n2(a)(1).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n34 See U.S. v.

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by the DOHA on February 4, 2008,\nadmitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 14, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued\non February 27, 2008, scheduling the hearing for March 19, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4, and admitted into the record without objection.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nApril 22,2008\n\n SOR subparagraph 1.a incorrectly lists the date of discharge as May 16, 2005. A copy of the\n2\ndischarge order, dated May 16, 2003, is included in GE 2.\n2\nApplicant testified and submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits (AE) 1-6, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was\nreceived on March 28, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old high school graduate who has been employed as a\nwarehouse worker by a defense contractor since October 2004. He was employed outside\nthe defense industry, by a variety of employers, as a forklift driver from August 1992 to May\n2002, as a truck driver from August 2002 to January 2003, as some type of equipment\noperator from January 2003 to October 2003, and as a machine operator form April 2003\nto April 2004. He was unemployed from May 2002 to August 2002, after his long-term\nemployer closed the business where he worked. He also was briefly self-employed\nrepairing automobiles from March 2004 to October 2004. He has never held a security\nclearance.\nApplicant was married in April 1996. His wife left him to take up residence with\nsomeone else in February 2006, and he filed for a divorce in January 2008. Applicant has\nthree children, ages 7, 20 and 21. None of his children reside with him, and he pays $465\nper month as support for the youngest child. \nApplicant\u2019s wife experienced health problems between 2002 and 2005, including\nsurgery to remove cancerous tumors. As a result of her health problems, she was\nunemployed for varying periods of time, including one period of approximately six months.\nThey were forced to attempt to support themselves solely on his income during her\nunemployment. \nApplicant presented himself as a very financially unsophisticated individual. He\ncredibly testified his wife was responsible for their finances as follows:\nWell, my wife was - - she was \u2013 she\u2019s smart, sir, so I - - I had - - I trusted her.\nBecause she know things I don\u2019t know. She reads better than me, she\u2019s a\nstronger reader so I - - I had to trust her. So, when she - - when she asked\nme to do something - - (Tr. p. 56)\nApplicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2003 due to her\nhospital bills and delinquent federal income taxes. (Tr. p. 34) They were awarded a\ndischarge in May 2003.  Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection\n2\nsometime in 2004, in an effort to protect their residence from foreclosure. Applicant\ndecided at the last moment that he did not want to pursue the bankruptcy but instead\n\n3\nwanted to attempt to enter into a repayment agreement with the mortgage holder himself.\nAs a result, the Chapter 13 petition was dismissed in February 2005.\nApplicant decided to allow the family vehicle to be voluntarily repossessed and the\nhouse to be foreclosed on after his wife deserted him. His explanation for so doing is:\n. . . I love my family, I love my wife, but I couldn\u2019t hold on to her so I had to\ngive it up. And the best way to kind of like get rid of the memories was just\nlet go of everything we had. \nAs far as the car, it was a van for her and my sons. My sons are grown\nexcept for one. When she left, she left the vehicle, I had no need for it. I\ncouldn\u2019t hold on to it so I let it go back.\n. . . I put the house on the market to sell. By it being a older home, at the\ntime the market was bad, nobody would buy the home, so I just let it go.\nMaybe I should have kept it but it was probably the best thing for me to do\nwas to let it go. (Tr. pp. 34-35)  \nThe delinquent debt alleged in the SOR, excluding the repossessed auto and the\nhouse foreclosure, consists of three accounts, totaling $1,861, that have either been\ncharged off as a bad debt or submitted for collection. The house was sold at a foreclosure\nsale in or about August 2007 (GE 2), and the creditor has not notified Applicant of any\ndeficit that remains owing. Applicant is repaying the delinquent creditors alleged in the\nSOR, and a couple of creditors who are not alleged, under a plan he entered into with a\nconsumer credit counseling service in October 2007. He has been making the agreed upon\npayments of $123 per month under the plan since November 2007. Those payments are\nautomatically debited from his bank account. He contacted the creditor on the repossessed\nautomobile, but was unsuccessful in working out a repayment plan because that creditor\nwanted him to pay the full purchase price for the car.  \n \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant obtained a discharge under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code in 2003. He\nsubsequently allowed his house to be foreclosed upon, voluntarily allowed an automobile\nto be repossessed, and allowed several other debts, totalling $1,861, to become delinquent\n\n5\nand either charged off as a bad debt or submitted for collection. Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s several periods of unemployment between 2002 and 2005, that\nwere necessitated by her health problems, contributed significantly to their financial\nproblems. He decided to allow the family vehicle to be repossessed and the marital\nresidence to be foreclosed on only after his wife decided to desert him, take his son, and\nbegin residing with another person. Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . .\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment applies. Additionally,\nthese circumstances allow for at least partial application of MC 20(b): the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe foreclosure and sale of the marital residence has apparently extinguished the\nliability Applicant had under the mortgage on that house. Except for the creditor owing for\nthe repossessed auto, he has entered into a repayment plan through a debt counselling\nservice to repay the delinquent creditors alleged in the SOR. He attempted to negotiate a\nsettlement of the debt owed on the repossessed auto but was unsuccessful due to the\nunreasonable amount demanded by that creditor. MC 20(c): the person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts apply.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nApplicant is a financially unsophisticated individual. He entrusted most, if not all,\nfinancial decisions to his wife during their marriage. He responded emotionally and made\nsome very unwise financial decisions after she deserted him. However, he has now taken\nappropriate steps to resolve his financial problems, appears to have regained control of his\nemotions, and he has put himself on a financially stable course. \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn, December 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial conditions. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2008, denied all of the allegations\nexcept 1.a, and 1.u, and requested an administrative determination. On February 27,\n2008, department counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant\nsubmitted a reply on March 8, 2008. On April 23, 2008, the case was assigned to me. I\nhave reviewed the FORM and Applicant\u2019s reply, and have concluded that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information.\nApril 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old single woman with two adult children. She has a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. On her security clearance application, she\nused an acronym to describe her position title, but did not elaborate. There is no\nadditional record evidence describing her job.\nApplicant and her husband divorced in 2002. Before the divorce, she was\ndependent on both her and her husband\u2019s income to make ends meet. Afterwards, she\nbegan to struggle.\nApproximately a year after Applicant\u2019s divorce, her mother suffered a series of\nmajor medical problems that rendered her an invalid (Reply at 1). She received part-\ntime professional home nursing care through a combination of retirement savings and\ngovernment benefits. Within a year of being disabled, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s savings were\ndepleted. Applicant then had to bear some of the costs of supporting her.\nApplicant\u2019s debts fell further behind. She consulted a credit counseling agency\nwho consolidated four of her debts, and arranged a payment plan (Reply at 2). Within\nthree months of arranging the payment plan, Applicant experienced a 50 per cent salary\ndecrease after her employer cut her work hours. The work slowdown lasted six months.\nSubsequently, Applicant was unable to execute the payment plan.\nBy June 2007, Applicant had accrued approximately $26,000 of delinquent debt\n(Items 6-7, 9-11). In September 2007, she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. All\nof the debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.r were included in the\nbankruptcy petition (See Bankruptcy Petition, Schedule F as included in Item 6) The\nbankruptcy court discharged the debts in December 2007.\nApplicant owns a car, and has recently satisfied the car note. Also, her mother is\nnow in a nursing home, and Applicant no longer has to support her financially (Reply at\n2). This \u201chas freed up around 500 dollars of [Applicant\u2019s] money each month\u201d (Id.).\nThe SOR alleges three delinquencies totalling approximately $38,000 that were\nnot included in the bankruptcy discharge (subparagraphs 1.s through 1.u). SOR\nsubparagraph 1.s is a home loan rather than a car loan as alleged (Letter from Bank,\ndated December 29, 2007, as included in Item 4 at 8). Applicant jointly owned the\nproperty with her then-husband. As part of their divorce decree, the husband assumed\nresponsibility for the mortgage, and the court \u201cset [it] over to [him] as his sole and\nseparate property\u201d (Divorce Decree, dated July 22, 2002, as included in Item 4 at 10).\nSOR subparagraph 1.t alleges a delinquent car loan. It was satisfied in May 2006\n(Letter from creditor faxed to Applicant December 31, 2007, as listed in Item 4 at 5). \n\n3\nSOR subparagraph 1.u alleges delinquent student loan payments. According to\nthe student loan creditor, Applicant is current, and her loans \u201chave never been in\ndelinquent or default status\u201d (Letter dated December 31, 2007, as listed in Item 4 at 6).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nSOR subparagraphs 1.s through 1.t were either resolved, or were not Applicant\u2019s\nresponsibility. They do not represent a security concern. Conversely, Applicant\nacknowledges that she accrued the remaining debts listed in the SOR. AG & 19(a), \u201can\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@; AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations,\u201d; and AG \u00b619(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which\nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d apply.\n\n4\nWithin two years, Applicant experienced a divorce, a family medical crisis, and a\nmajor pay cut. As each successive misfortune occurred, she grew further in debt. She\ntried to get her finances under control by organizing a payment plan, but was unable to\nadhere to it because of these various hardships. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding in\nDecember 2007. Her mother is now in a nursing home, and is no longer a financial\nburden for Applicant. She has $500 of additional income remaining each month. AG \u00b6\n20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d applies.\nReferencing DOHA caselaw, department counsel argues that the granting of a\nChapter 7 discharge does not automatically trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\u201d Further, he characterizes her bankruptcy filing as an \u201celeventh hour effort\u201d to\nresolve her financial problems (FORM at 7). \nDepartment counsel\u2019s recitation of DOHA caselaw is correct. However, I reject\nhis characterization of Applicant\u2019s effort to resolve her financial problems. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were caused by an extraordinary series of misfortunes, and her\nfailure to satisfy them stemmed from inability rather than procrastination. Also, before\nfiling for bankruptcy protection, she sought credit counseling and arranged a payment\nplan, but it failed after she experienced another personal setback when her employer\nhalved her wages. Under these circumstances, I conclude her efforts to resolve her\ndelinquencies were in good faith, and that AG \u00b6 20(d) applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n5\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination must be an overall commonsense judgment\nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent financial debt was not caused by extravagant spending.\nInstead, it was caused by an extraordinary series of major personal misfortunes that\noccurred within a short period of time. She has resolved her delinquencies through the\nChapter 7 bankruptcy process, and her monthly disposable income has increased by\n$500. Upon considering the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the context of the\nwhole person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial consideration\nsecurity concern. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On May 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and J\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on July 8, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on September 15, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on\nSeptember 16, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on October 28,\n2008, in Santa Barbara, California. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 10,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and\nsubmitted Exhibit A, which was entered without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request\n\n2\nto keep the record open until November 7, 2008, to submit additional matters.  She\ntimely submitted Exhibit B, which has been received and entered without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on November 6, 2008, and the record\nclosed on that date. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 32 years old. She is not currently married, and she has one son. She\nreceived an Associates of Arts Degree in Criminal Justice in 2007.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 22 allegations (1.a. through 1.v.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  All of the allegations will be discussed in the same\norder as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $553. Applicant\ntestified that she had paid this bill. Exhibit 8 establishes that this debt has been paid.  \n1.b. This overdue debt, also to the same Creditor as 1.a., above, is cited in the\nSOR in the amount of $272. Applicant testified that she believed that this debt was\nincluded under the debt above, but it is listed as a separate debt. Applicant has not\nestablished that this debt has been resolved as a separate debt or that it should be\nincluded under 1.a., above. \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $318.  Applicant\ntestified that she has made an agreement to pay $50 a week until this debt is resolved.\nThus far she has not made any payments, so at this time the full amount listed is still\nowed. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $59. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was discharged in the bankruptcy that she filed in 2004, and\nwhich is discussed under 1.v., below. Exhibit 5 establishes that this is one of the\ncreditors that was discharged in bankruptcy. \n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $451 for a medical\nprovider. Applicant testified that she believed that all of her medical bills had been\ndischarged in bankruptcy. Three medical bills are included on her list of creditors,\ncreditor #7 in the amount of $365, creditor #12 in the amount of $243, and creditor #21\nin the amount of $401 (Exhibit 5).  Since this debt does not appear to be listed on her\nbankruptcy, I can not conclude that this debt has been resolved.\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $348 for a medical\nprovider.  Since this debt also does not appear to be listed on her bankruptcy, I can not\nconclude that this debt has been resolved.\n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $475 for a medical\nprovider.  Since this debt also does not appear to be listed on her bankruptcy, I can not\nconclude that this debt has been resolved.\n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $45. Applicant\ntestified that she had no knowledge of the origin of this debt, and since it arose in April\n2006 (Exhibit 7), it could not have been resolved in the bankruptcy, and no evidence\nwas introduced to establish that it has been paid.  \n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $51.  Applicant\ntestified that this debt was discharged in the bankruptcy that she filed in 2004. Exhibit 5\nestablishes that this is one of the creditors that was discharged in bankruptcy. \n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $724. This debt has\nnot been paid.  \n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,290 for a medical\nprovider.  Applicant testified that she had no knowledge of the origin of this debt, and no\nevidence was introduced to establish that it has been resolved in bankruptcy or paid. \n1.l. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $634.  Applicant\ntestified that she had no knowledge of the origin of this debt, and she has made no\nattempt to contact this creditor.\n1.m. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $395 for a medical\nprovider.  As reviewed above, Applicant testified that she thought her medical bill were\ndischarged in bankruptcy. This debt does not appear to be listed on her bankruptcy, so I\ncan not conclude that this debt has been resolved. \n1.n. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,553 for a medical\nprovider.  This debt also does not appear to be listed on her bankruptcy, so I can not\nconclude that this debt has been resolved.\n1.o. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,087 for a medical\nprovider.  This debt also does not appear to be listed on her bankruptcy, so I can not\nconclude that this debt has been resolved.\n\n4\n1.p. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $614.  Applicant\ntestified that she had no knowledge of the origin of this debt, and she has made no\nattempt to contact this creditor.\n1.q. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $457. Applicant\ntestified that she believed the only debts that she had from this creditor were discharged\nin bankruptcy.  Exhibit 5 establishes that two debts from this creditor were discharged in\nbankruptcy. It does appear that this debt was discharged in bankruptcy.\n1.r. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $551.  This is the\nsecond debt to the creditor listed in 1.q., above, and Exhibit 5 seems to establish that\nthis debt was discharged in bankruptcy. \n1.s. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $288.  Applicant\ntestified that she has paid this debt. \n1.t. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $90.  This is a second\ndebt to the same creditor listed as 1.s., above. Applicant testified that she did not recall\nthis second debt to this creditor. \n1.u. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $364.   Applicant\ntestified that she believed that she had paid all but $20 of this debt. However, she had\nno documentation to establish that she had paid this debt.  \n1.v. On October 27, 2004, Applicant petitioned the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In February 2005 her debts were discharged in\nbankruptcy. Her debts totaled $21,200. \n \nApplicant testified that she has contacted a credit consulting agency (cca) to help\nher resolve her debts. At the time of the hearing she had not paid any fee to this\ncompany, but she testified that she planned to make a payment of $323 shortly after the\nhearing. Exhibit B, which Applicant submitted after the hearing, is a document from the\ncca showing that Applicant was in the process of using their services. However, not only\nwas the cca a different name than that to which Applicant testified at the hearing, but\nthe document indicated that Applicant had yet to make any payments to them to begin\ntheir service, although she was scheduled to begin on November 21, 2008.  I find that it\nis far too soon to establish that Applicant will use this company\u2019s services, and that they\nwill help her resolve her overdue indebtedness. \nApplicant testified that the primary reason for her financial difficulties is that when\nshe was married to her husband, he would not be responsible in his spending habits.\n\n5\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe SOR lists 3 allegations, 2.a. through 2.c., regarding criminal conduct under\nAdjudicative Guideline J. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. On April 22, 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with Petty Theft. She\npled no contest and was sentenced to serve three years unsupervised probation, 30\ndays in jail and to pay fines totaling $285. She also was ordered to stay out of the\ndepartment store from which she committed the Petty Theft. Applicant admitted that she\nand a friend had attempted to steal clothing by placing it under her street clothes and\nleave the store without paying for it. \n1.b. On May 16, 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with Petty Theft. She\npled no contest. She served the sentence that has been discussed in 2.a., above as\npart of the punishment for both criminal acts, including serve three years unsupervised\nprobation and 30 days in jail. She also had to perform 100 hours of community service,\nand she also was ordered to stay out of the store from which she was convicted of Petty\nTheft. \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied that she had committed the act in this store. She\nclaimed that a friend had placed a bag in her shopping cart, and she walked out of the\nstore without realizing that it had not been paid.   While Applicant claimed that she did\nnot knowingly engage in this illegal act, the evidenced establishes that she was\nconvicted for Petty Theft and sentenced as reviewed above, and this issue will not be\nrelitigated at this time. \n1.c.  On January 11, 2004, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with\nBattery. Applicant plead no contest to the lesser offense of Disturbing the Peace by\nFighting.  She was sentenced to serve two years unsupervised probation, and to pay\nfines totaling $645. \nAt the hearing, Applicant contended that she had been attacked by another\nwoman and only hit her in self defense. However, again, the evidenced establishes that\nshe was convicted of Disturbing the Peace by Fighting, and this issue also will not be\nrelitigated at this time. \n \nApplicant introduced seven letters of recommendation from individuals who have\nknown Applicant in her current position of employment. They spoke in extremely\npositive terms about Applicant\u2019s \u201cgood character and a strong and consistent work\nethic.\u201d There was no indication in the letters as to whether or not the individuals have\nany knowledge as to the allegations that are described in the SOR.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n6\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s long history of not meeting financial\nobligations and her continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts. \nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies as Applicant has failed to\nresolve the vast majority of long overdue debts. While she has contacted a credit\ncounseling service, Exhibit B establishes that she had yet to make any payments at the\ntime the document had been submitted. Therefore, it is far too soon to for me to\nconclude that Applicant has engaged in a systematic effort to resolve her overdue\ndebts. Additionally, while Applicant has been divorced, it does not appear that the\ndivorce contributed to most of her indebtedness. I, therefore, hold Guideline F against\nApplicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged\nin criminal conduct, as he was arrested for, and convicted of criminal offenses including:\nPetty Theft on two occasions in 1996 and Disturbing the Peace by Fighting in 2004.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation\nConditions (MC), I find that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation because the last criminal conduct occurred in 2004, and\nApplicant has expressed a sincere desire to act in more responsible manner, especially\nto be a better role model to her son. Applicant has mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2\nis found for Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n8\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and J, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, her failure to resolve the overdue debts, and her history of criminal conduct, I\nfind that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.v.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the two SOR allegations with explanation. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 37-year-old senior human resources specialist, who has worked for a Government contractor since May 2007. GE 1, AE A. She is a first- time applicant for a security clearance. Tr. 44-45. Applicant graduated from high school in June 1988, and has completed approximately 45 hours of college credit. Tr. 42.-43 Applicant is the single mother of a 14-year-old son, and in 1999 became solely responsible for his support. Tr. 22-23. Applicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and included the review of her security clearance application, and Response to her DOHA Financial Interrogatories of October 2007.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on May \n23, 2007. On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMarch 31, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 19, 2007, and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the \nresponse on December 21, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non January 22, 2008, and I received the case assignment on January 28, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 5, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nFebruary 27, 2008.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant did not offer any exhibits during her hearing, \nbut did testify on her own behalf. Post-hearing, Department Counsel notified me \nby letter dated February 27, 2008 that the SOR case number and other \ndocuments in the case file was incorrect. He provided me with the correct case \nnumber and requested that I amend/correct the case number. Tr. 9-10, 53-55, \nExhibit (Ex.) I. \n \nI held the record open until March 7, 2008 to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit documents on her behalf. Applicant timely submitted AE A \nthrough J without objection, which were forwarded to me by Department Counsel \nby letter dated March 7, 2008 (Ex. II). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on March 7, 2008. The record closed on March 7, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the two SOR allegations with explanation. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a thorough review of \nthe evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old senior human resources specialist, who has \nworked for a Government contractor since May 2007. GE 1, AE A. She is a first-\ntime applicant for a security clearance. Tr. 44-45. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1988, and has completed \napproximately 45 hours of college credit. Tr. 42.-43 Applicant is the single mother \nof a 14-year-old son, and in 1999 became solely responsible for his support. Tr. \n22-23. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her security clearance application, and Response to her \nDOHA Financial Interrogatories of October 2007. GE 1, GE 2. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified two separate line items to include a chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filed in December 2005, followed by a discharge in April 2006;  and a \n2006 federal income tax debt arrearage in the amount of $8,322. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and \n1.b. \n \n\n \n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after she became a single parent \nwithout child support. She began accumulating high interest debts and as time \nwent on, her debt became unmanageable on her limited income. She found \nherself unable to remain current on her debts and in 2006, she experienced \nintermittent periods of unemployment. Tr. 20. Overwhelmed, she consulted a \nbankruptcy attorney and was counseled to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Tr. 21-23.  \n \nDuring the time Applicant was experiencing financial difficulty and before \nshe filed for bankruptcy, she had a low paying job making approximately $23k per \nyear. Struggling to make ends meet and on the advice of \u201cfriends,\u201d she changed \nher federal income tax exemptions to \u201ceight or nine\u201d to increase the amount of her \nnet take home pay. She explained before she changed her exemptions, her take \nhome pay was approximately $600 every two weeks and her rent was $600 per \nmonth.  \n \nWhen it came time to file her income taxes, she did not have enough \nmoney withheld to pay her income taxes. This created her income tax liability to \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflected in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Tr. 27-28. She has \nbeen diligently paying off her debt to the IRS for the past \u201ctwo or three years.\u201d Tr. \n29. Initially, she was paying the IRS $25 per month, however, since January 2008, \nshe increased her monthly IRS payment to $250. This amount is automatically \ndeducted from her pay check. Tr. 30, 37-38,GE 2. \n \nApplicant\u2019s son has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder (ADHD) and requires medical treatment and medication. As a single \nparent, Applicant has had to pay for her son\u2019s uncovered medical and prescription \ncosts. Tr. 22-26 50.   \n \nIn conjunction with filing for bankruptcy, Applicant participated in mandatory \nfinancial counseling. After receiving her SOR, Applicant also sought financial \ncounseling through her credit union. Tr. 26-27, 39-40, 46-47. Applicant\u2019s current \nannual salary is $80k per year and her monthly budget reflects a net remainder of \n$954 after she pays all of her bills. AE B. \n \nApplicant provided her most recent work performance evaluation which \nreflects \u201coutstanding\u201d performance. AE A. She also submitted eight reference \nletters covering a cross section of people who know her and are familiar with her. \nIncluded among these letters is one from her Executive Vice President, her Senior \nPastor, a Senior Human Resources Specialist, and four personal references. The \ntenor of these letters focuses, among other things, on her integrity, contribution to \nthe community, and the superb job she is doing as a single parent. AE A through \nJ. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as \nto obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n5\n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern \nis that an Applicant\u2019s \n \n \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged she made some poor financial decisions. Her \nproblems stem primarily from being a single parent without child support, and \nworking in a low paying job. She experienced a brief period of unemployment and \nfound herself incurring high interest loans to survive. Recognizing she was in over \nher head, she sought advice from a bankruptcy attorney and on his advice, filed \nfor chapter 7 in 2005. She was awarded a discharge in 2006. She incurred a debt \nto the IRS during this time, which was not discharged in bankruptcy. She is \ncurrent on this debt having started at a modest payment of $25 per month to \ntoday\u2019s $250 per month. \n \n \nShe participated in two separate types of financial counseling. The first \nfinancial counseling she participated in was mandatory and in conjunction with her \nchapter 7 bankruptcy. The second financial counseling she participated in was \nvoluntary and through her credit union. Applicant\u2019s son is also diagnosed with \nADHD. She is solely responsible for his care and any unreimbursed medical \nexpenses. Applicant\u2019s financial picture has taken a sharp turnaround from her \nformer annual salary of $24k per year to her present $80k per year. Her budget \nreflects a net remainder of $954 per month after her monthly bills are paid. What \nis different now as opposed to before is she has the means and the tools to \nachieve financial stability. \n \n \nHer reference letters are noteworthy. She has proven to be a conscientious \nand caring single parent, a trusted and valued employee, and a contributing \nmember of society. \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt \nor establish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial \nbreaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, \nhigh debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, \ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be \nexplained by subject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets \nor returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of \ngambling losses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay \ngambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by \ngambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \nlisted supra, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are applicable or partially \napplicable: \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n \n2  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.b.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On January 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign\ninfluence (Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 9, 2008. On April 2,\n2008, DOHA scheduled the hearing for April 23, 2008. The hearing was postponed\nbecause Applicant was working on an assignment in the Middle East. On April 9, 2008,\nApplicant was informed that the hearing would be rescheduled for June 2, 2008. The\nhearing was completed on that day. Based on a careful evaluation of all the evidence in\nthe record, Applicant\u2019s eligibility of security clearance access is granted. \nAugust 11, 2008\n\n2\nAt the hearing, the government submitted three exhibits (GE). The third exhibit\n(GE 3, administrative notice exhibit) contains publications from United States\nGovernment agencies that describe the government of Taiwan, its human rights record\ninternally, its geopolitical relationship with its neighbors and around the world, and its\npolicies regarding the collection of intelligence information. At the hearing, testimony\nwas taken from Applicant. He provided two character statements following the hearing.\nOn June 9, 2008, Department Counsel indicated the government had no objection to\nthe exhibits being entered in the record. The two exhibits are now in the record as AE A.\nDOHA received the transcript on June 12, 2008.\nRulings on Procedure\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR has attachments including a copy of part of the\nUnited States (U.S.) passport belonging to his wife. Also, copies of his father-in-law\u2019s\nand mother-in-law\u2019s permanent resident cards are attached to his answer. Those\ndocuments are marked and admitted in evidence as AE B (incomplete copy of the\npassport belonging to Applicant\u2019s wife), and AE C ( the permanent resident identification\ncards of his father and mother-in law). \nGE 2 (answers to interrogatories) is undated. Applicant was asked to review the\nexhibit. He stated that he recognized the exhibit, and was fairly certain he signed the\nanswers on March 17 or 18, 2007. (Tr. 16) He also indicated he had no objection to its\nadmission in evidence. (Tr. 17) Having carefully reviewed the exhibit and found that it\nconfirms a considerable amount of information found elsewhere in the record, GE 2 was\nadmitted in evidence.

After completing the Republic of China Air Force\nacademy in 1967, he became a fighter pilot for Air Force for several years in the early\n1990s. From 1998 to 2003, he held various intelligence positions for the military. After\nserving for two years in positions at the military command level, he retired from the\nmilitary in March 2006. In May 2006, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law became chairman of a\nplane manufacturer, a commercial organization under the Taiwanese Economic Affairs\ndepartment.\nWhen the communication (including physical visits) Applicant and his wife have\nwith their parents-in-law are added together, the contacts average more than once a\nmonth. Topics of discussion Applicant and his parents-in-law address are always about\nfamily issues. Applicant has never talked to his father-in-law about professional subjects\nor the father-in-law\u2019s U.S. professional contacts. The only time Applicant ever met any\nof his father-in-law\u2019s military colleagues was during Applicant\u2019s wedding in November\n1999.\nAs noted in GE 1, Applicant has no foreign property or financial interests. He has\nnever been a consultant to a foreign government. The only way he is associated with\nforeign entities is through his project assignments. He has never been directly employed\nby a foreign country. (GE 2)  He has never had contact with foreign officials. He has\n1\nonly a U.S. passport. Applicant earns about $130,000.00 a year. He has approximately\n$200,000.00 in his retirement plans. He has established mutual funds for his children,\nand owns rental property. He also owns his home worth approximately $750,00.00, and\nhas been living there since 2003. \n\n U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Taiwan, (Background Note: Taiwan), October 2007.\n2\n National Counterintelligence Center, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\n3\nIndustrial Espionage 2000, (Annual Report to Congress - 2000).\n Statement of Facts, United States v.

The\ndevelopment also has designated certain houses as part of the \u201cSafe House Program,\u201d\na location where troubled children can go for protection and guidance. \nApplicant\u2019s friend of 15 years is a retired investigator for one of the U.S. military\ninvestigative services, an is currently an adjudicator in another branch of the federal\ngovernment. He attended Applicant\u2019s wedding. He considers Applicant reliable and\ntrustworthy. Applicant\u2019s coworker and friend for the past four years, has worked with him\non a daily basis for the past year on a project where Applicant is the project leader. He\nrates Applicant as a true professional who is committed to project objectives without\nsacrificing quality assurance along the way. \nAdministrative Notice\nThe U.S. recognized the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) and also the Peoples\nRepublic of China (PRC) from 1949 to 1979. In January 1979 the U.S. officially\nindicated that the PRC was the only legal government of China.  \n2\nThe ROC has developed a robust economy, but its security remains under\nconstant threat from the PRC, and the PRC\u2019s elaborate intelligence gathering network\nthat utilizes some of the intelligence apparatus active in Taiwan. Taiwan is an active\ncollector of U.S. intelligence. The ROC\u2019s intelligence gathering operation is one of the\nmost active according to reports of the National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC)\ngenerated in 2000.  Evidence of recent espionage activity directed at the U.S. include\n3\nespionage incidents in 2005 and 2006, that have led to criminal prosecution and\nconviction.  \n4\nThe political system of the ROC is a multi-party democracy with an improving\nhuman rights record. Though the U.S. has not had formal diplomatic relations with the\nROC since January 1979, the U.S. has sold the ROC military equipment  and\n5\ntransacted billions of dollars in trade with them on an annual basis. \n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened risk of\nforcing an applicant into a position of having to choose between the foreign entity and\nthe U.S. \n\n6\nAnalysis\n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests result in security concerns\nwhere those contacts and interests create divided loyalties, or may be manipulated or\ninduced by a foreign entity that is harmful to U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign entity. Decisions under this guideline should include the foreign\ncountry where the contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to\nwhether the foreign government targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information\nand/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d \nThe SOR alleges under 1.a. that the citizenship of Applicant\u2019s spouse in Taiwan\nraises FI concerns. In November 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse became a U.S. citizen. (AE\nB) The SOR alleges under 1.b. that Applicant\u2019s father and mother-in-law are citizens\nand residents of Taiwan. They are also permanent resident aliens of the U.S. (AE C),\nthough they spend some time every year in Taiwan. The record does not indicate the\namount of time they spend in the ROC and the amount of time they spend in the U.S.\nHowever, based on the current position of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law in the commercial\norganization, and entity of the Taiwanese government, it would be fair to conclude that\nthey spend more than half a year in the ROC. \nPotential security concerns are raised by the contact Applicant and his wife have\nwith their in-laws who spend some time in Taiwan, and also by the 46-year-history\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law has had in the military and commercial industry of Taiwan.\nForeign Influence (FI) disqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\nor a resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), FI DC 7.b. (connections\nto a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation), and FI DC 7.d. (sharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship, status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion) apply. Because Applicant\u2019s mother-in-\nlaw and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan, even though they have\npermanent resident cards and expect to become U.S. citizens, a heightened risk for\nforeign coercion and potential for conflict arises that shifts the burden to Applicant to\nshow why he believes the heightened risk is manageable, and he will resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. The residual FI concerns that still may exist\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s wife have been dramatically reduced by her naturalization as a\nU.S. citizen in November 2006. \nIn assessing the applicability of the mitigating conditions under the FI guideline, it\nis important to evaluate the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the\nU.S., along with the foreign government\u2019s human rights record, and/or whether the\ncountry conducts intelligence operations in the U.S., or engages in external terrorist\noperations. One should not lose sight of the fact that even with the friendly relations the\n\n7\nU.S. has had with the ROC, the country has engaged in espionage against U.S.\ninterests over the years. See, ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 15-16, (App. Bd. Mar. 29,\n2002) Though the friendly relationship the ROC has with the U.S. should be evaluated\nwith caution, it is still a favorable piece of evidence that must be factored into the ROC\u2019s\nimproving human rights record. Ultimately, assessments must be made as to whether\nthe ROC would want to jeopardize its relationship with the U.S. by applying some kind\nof pressure on it\u2019s own citizenry to reach a U.S. citizen. \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S.) applies to partially offset the FI concerns under FI DC 7.a.,\n7.b., and 7.d., because neither Applicant\u2019s wife, a citizen of the U.S., nor his mother-in-\nlaw, a permanent resident of this country, have ever worked for the ROC government,\nor have been agents of the Taiwanese government. Though the contact with both in-\nlaws has been determined to be more than once a month, the discussions have been\nstrictly about family concerns of relatives who care for one another. Applicant has never\ntalked to his father-in-law about professional matters, and his father-in-law has not\nasked Applicant about his job responsibilities, although he knows Applicant works with\ncomputers. \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and long lasting relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest) receives greater application because Applicant\u2019s familial and financial bonds to\nthe U.S. justify complete confidence that Applicant will resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of U.S. Applicant\u2019s familial bonds begin with his birth in the U.S. in 1969, and\nnaturalization of his parents as U.S. citizens in 1978. Applicant\u2019s brother was also born\nin the U.S. and lives in the area. Applicant\u2019s professional career has embraced U.S.\njobs where he has amassed a substantial retirement savings account and a home worth\nmore than $750,000.00. \nIn determining whether FI MC 8.c. applies, one must evaluate the entire picture\nof contacts that an applicant has with a family member in a foreign country, rather than\nthe individual contacts he has with each family member. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7\n(App Bd. Sept. 22, 2003). The DOHA Appeal Board has held there is a rebuttable\npresumption that contacts with a foreign family member are not casual. ISCR Case No.\n00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002) FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk\nfor foreign influence or exploitation) does not apply based on the level of contact\nApplicant has with his in-laws. However, I do not conclude this level of contact security\ndisqualifying. On balance, I find Applicant has overcome the adverse evidence under\nthe Guideline. \n\n8\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding against Applicant under the FI guideline must still be evaluated in the\ncontext of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAssuming Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to overcome the negative evidence\nunder the FI guideline, I find for Applicant under the whole person model. First,\nApplicant was born in this country in 1969. He attended school in the U.S. and was\nawarded a Masters in Science degree in 1999. Applicant\u2019s parents immigrated to this\ncountry and became naturalized citizens in 1978. His mother has always been a\nhousewife, and his father is now a retired physician. Applicant has a 39-year-old brother\nwho was born in this country. While his spouse did not become a U.S. citizen until\nNovember 2006, she graduated from a U.S. high school. She received a degree in\naccounting from a highly regarded U.S. university. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law obtained\nher permanent resident card in late 2006, and her father-in-law got his permanent\nresident card in January 2007. They both aspire to become U.S. citizens. Applicant has\nnever discussed professional topics with his father-in-law.\nApplicant has no foreign financial interests or property. He has never been\nassociated with any foreign government in any way. His exposure to foreign\ngovernments comes from his job assignments all over the world. Applicant has worked\nat his current job since 2003. His colleague indicated that Applicant has delivered a\nqualify, professional work product, and his friend of 15 years believes he is reliable and\ntrustworthy. \nApplicant has two children, ages four and two, who were born in the U.S. His\nincome as an associate is approximately $130,000.00; his retirement plan is now at\nabout $200,000.00, and he has established mutual funds to help finance his children\u2019s\neducational aspirations. Applicant owns his own house worth about $750,000.00. He\nalso has a rental property. On balance, the totality of Applicant\u2019s familial and economic\nbonds to the U.S. buttress my conclusion that his evidence successfully mitigates the\nforeign influence concerns set forth in the SOR. Accordingly, the FI guideline is decided\nfor Applicant. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor  Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Since 2000, the Applicant has had a history of not meeting his financial obligations. His financial difficulties were caused by his inability to obtain a decent paying job and by spending beyond his means. The Applicant has had to take jobs that did not provide adequate financial support for his family. Even so, he tried to provide for his family the best he knew how. He wanted them to live in a good area, a nice house, and he spent money that he did not have. As a result, the Applicant became excessively indebted.

On November 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 9, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on February 4, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 11,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for March 5, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant\npresented five exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E.  The Applicant\nalso testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until March 26, 2008, to\nallow the Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  The Applicant\nsubmitted nine Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1\nthrough 9.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 14, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 46 years old and married.  He has a high school diploma.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as an Armed Security Officer and is seeking to obtain\na security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nSince 2000, the Applicant has had a history of not meeting his financial\nobligations.  His financial difficulties were caused by his inability to obtain a decent\npaying job and by spending beyond his means.  The Applicant has had to take jobs that\ndid not provide adequate financial support for his family.  Even so, he tried to provide for\nhis family the best he knew how.  He wanted them to live in a good area, a nice house,\nand he spent money that he did not have.  As a result, the Applicant became\nexcessively indebted.  At one point, the Applicant was renting a four bedroom house for\nhis family and paying $1,500.00 a month for rent.  He now realizes that he can no\nlonger afford that lifestyle.    \nThe Applicant admits each of the debts set forth in the Statement of Reasons\nthat include seventeen separate creditors totaling approximately $13,000.00.  In\nOctober 2007, the Applicant\u2019s monthly net income of $2,494.00 was insufficient to cover\nhis monthly living expenses of $2,507.00.  (See Government Exhibit 5).  At that time, in\naddition to his salary the Applicant was receiving $800.00 from boarders. \nIn an effort to resolve his indebtedness, the Applicant contacted a consumer\ncredit counselor in October 2007, to assist in paying off his outstanding debts.  The\nconsumer counselor set up a payment plan as requested by the Applicant.  The\nApplicant took no immediate action towards his debts at the time, because he did not\nhave the money to do so.  In December 2007, the Applicant started making payments\naccording to the plan which required at that time that he pay $202.00 per month.  He\nmade three payments under the plan prior to the hearing.  Unbeknownst to the\nApplicant, the consumer credit counselor did not include all of the debts set forth in the\nSOR.  Furthermore, the records from the consumer credit counselor do not show any\nreduction in the debt owed by the Applicant considering the three payments he made.\nThe Applicant was given an opportunity to revise the payment plan or question the\ncredit counselor concerning this documentation.  \nFor the past year and three months, the Applicant has worked for his current\nemployer.  In his opinion, the job pays well, $1,500.00 a month, and has enabled him to\npay his bills and support his family.  The Applicant also realizes the importance of\n\n3\npaying his bills on time.  He has significantly reduced his overhead and moved his\nfamily into a small apartment where the rent is $950.00 in order to free up money to pay\nhis delinquent bills.  He has used his income tax refund to pay off his some of his bills.\nHe is also anticipating a part-time job that will pay him an extra $1,200.00 a month that\nwill be used to pay his delinquent debts.  \nA civil judgment owed to Rialto Venture in the amount of $751.00 cannot be\nlocated by the court clerk.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 1).  A civil judgment\nowed to Robert Striker in the amount of $3,712.00 is included in the payment schedule\nand is being paid.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).  A debt owed to Asset\nAcceptance in the amount of $456.00 is included in the payment schedule and is being\npaid.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).  A debt owed to Direct T.V. in the\namount of $228.00 was paid on March 3, 2008.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit\n3).

A debt owed to Credit Management in the amount of $119.00 is included in\nthe payment schedule and is being paid.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exihibit 2).  A\ndebt owed to MS Wireless in the amount of $100.00 is included in the payment\nschedule and is being paid.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).  A debt owed to\nFirst Premier in the amount of $407.00 was paid on February 28, 2008.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 4).  A debt owed to Elite Towing in the amount of\n$2,048.00 is included in the payment schedule and is being paid.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit 2).

A debt owed to US Asset Management in the amount of $205.00 is included\nin the payment schedule and is being paid.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).  A\ndebt owed to GC Services in the amount of $834.00 has been written off.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit 1).  A debt owed to Golden State in the amount of $1,057.00 is\nincluded in the payment schedule and is being paid.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit 2).        \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit contains information concerning each of the\ndelinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  Each of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR,\nexcept the court judgment listed in allegation 1(a), have either been paid off, or how\nbeen included in the debt payment worksheet prepared by the consumer credit\ncounselor and are being paid on a monthly basis.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit\n2).  The Applicant\u2019s payment scheduled was revised and he is now required to pay\n$351.00 per month under the plan.  He made his first payment of $351.00 under the\nrevised schedule on March 14, 2008.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 6).  With\n\n4\nregard to the court judgment, the Applicant was told by the clerk of the court that\nbecause the judgment was so old, (1995), she was no longer able to retrieve a record of\nthe judgment.  The credit consumer counselor then advised the Applicant that because\nthe debt is over seven years old, it is supposed to be removed from his credit report.\nThe credit counselor plans to assist the Applicant in getting this judgment removed from\nhis credit report.  The Applicant also plans to continue to make regular monthly\npayments under the payment plan until all of his other debts are paid in full.       \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\n \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n\n5\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\n\n6\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant his a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant\u2019s poor financial history was caused by a\ncombination of his inability to obtain a decent paying job and his spending beyond his\nmeans.  With regard to his delinquent indebtedness, the Applicant has either paid off\nthe debt, or he has set up a payment plan and is making regular monthly payments\ntoward resolving them.  He plans to continue paying the debts until they are paid in full.\nIn addition, he has reduced his spending and has taken on a second part-time job to get\nthese bills paid as soon as possible.  He now understands the importance of paying his\nbills on time and not living beyond his means.  Under the circumstances, he has made a\ngood faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is evidence of financial\nrehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial\naffairs.  In the event that the Applicant does not continue to pay his delinquent debts\naccording to the payment plan or sooner if possible, his security clearance will be in\nimmediate jeopardy.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  Mitigating Conditions 20.(c) the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control and 20.(d) the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nThis Applicant has changed his irresponsible ways.  He is living within his means\nand is paying his delinquent debts.  He has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and\n\n7\nthat he meets the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 for the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r:\nFor the Applicant\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n\n8\n",

He was employed by two different defense contractors from August 1999 to August 2004. He possessed a security clearance at various levels, including top secret with access to sensitive compartmented information, from in or about August 1999 until it was revoked in or about August 2004. His clearance was revoked after he failed a lifestyle polygraph examination as part of a background investigation when he applied for employment with another government agency. The polygraph examination apparently revealed earlier illegal drug use by Applicant.3 Applicant graduated from high school in 1995.

The SOR\n1\nalleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on April 4, 2008. He\nadmitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p,2\nand 1.w. He denied the remaining allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 24, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMay 7, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 3, 2008. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 27, 2008\n\n The record contains very little information about the use of drugs by Applicant. No information is\n3\navailable about whether he actually abused drugs and, if so, when the drug use occurred, what drugs were\nused, the extent of the drug use, or the duration of the use. Applicant\u2019s possible abuse of drugs has not been\nraised as a trustworthiness concern herein and will not be discussed further.\n2\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-4, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted 14 documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n(AE) 1-14, and admitted into the record without objection. The record was held open to\nprovide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his case.\nThree documents were timely received, marked as AE 15-17, and admitted into the record\nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum for AE 15-17 was\nmarked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I, and made part of the record. The transcript was\nreceived on June 18, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 30 years old and has been employed as a server analyst by a staffing\nagency working under a contract with a defense contractor since March 2005. He was\nemployed by two different defense contractors from August 1999 to August 2004. He\npossessed a security clearance at various levels, including top secret with access to\nsensitive compartmented information, from in or about August 1999 until it was revoked\nin or about August 2004. His clearance was revoked after he failed a lifestyle polygraph\nexamination as part of a background investigation when he applied for employment with\nanother government agency. The polygraph examination apparently revealed earlier illegal\ndrug use by Applicant.3\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1995. He served on active duty in the U.S.\nArmy from September 1995 to September 1999, and he attained the rank of specialist\nfourth class (paygrade E-4). He was awarded an associate of arts degree in September\n2000, and a bachelor of science degree in information technology in September 2002. He\nhas been married since January 2006, and has three children, ages four years, sixteen\nmonths, and seven months.   \nThe SOR alleges 22 accounts, totaling $19,711, that have either been charged off\nas bad debts or submitted for collection. Of those 22 accounts, Applicant successfully\nchallenged his liability on nine accounts, totaling $1,780, and had them removed from his\ncredit report. He satisfied ten accounts, totaling $10,846, by paying the creditors either the\nfull amount owing or a negotiated reduced settlement. He retained an attorney to assist\nhim in resolving two accounts, totaling $6,066, and testified he will pay those accounts in\nfull if the attorney is unable to negotiate a reduced settlement on his behalf. Applicant\nentered into a repayment plan on the remaining collection account, owing in the amount\nof $1,019, and made one payment in the amount of $141 as of the date of the hearing. \n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n4\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n5\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n6\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n7\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n8\n3\nThe SOR alleges one account, owing in the amount of $4,826, that represents the\ndeficit due following the resale of a vehicle that was repossessed from Applicant. This\naccount has been fully satisfied by the payment of a negotiated settlement in the amount\nof $1,569. Finally, the SOR alleges one account, owing in the amount of $400, that\nresulted in a judgment being entered against Applicant. This account has been paid in full.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems primarily resulted from the loss of his employment\nwith defense contractors when his security clearance was revoked in 2004. From\nSeptember 2004 to December 2005, he went through a series of jobs that paid him\nsubstantially less than he had previously earned. With his current employment and income,\nhe has been able to satisfy most of his delinquent creditors and has demonstrated he is\nliving well within his means.  \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n4\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.5\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n6\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.7\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The entire\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, and any\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information will be\nresolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national interest\nand are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.8\n\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n4\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n9\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n10\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant had numerous delinquent accounts, totalling almost $25,000, that were\ncharged off as bad debts, submitted for collection and/or resulted in a judgment being\nentered against him. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant has either satisfied or successfully disputed the vast majority of the\ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. He has entered into a repayment plan on one of\nthe remaining accounts under terms that are fully within his means to comply with and has\nretained the assistance of an attorney to resolve the other two remaining accounts.\nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and MC 20(e): the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were primarily caused by the loss of his employment\nin 2004. His income was thereafter reduced until he was able to obtain employment with\nhis current employer. Since obtaining his current job, Applicant has taken substantial steps\nto resolve all his financial problems and he is currently living a financially responsible\nlifestyle. MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances applies.\nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\n\n5\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant access to sensitive information. Guideline F is decided for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-x:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. She partially admits but denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. She denies SOR allegations \u00b6 1.b. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor who is seeking a position of public trust. She has worked as a project manager for her current employer since April 2006. She was awarded a masters degree in business administration (MBA) in January 2008. She is divorced and has a daughter, age 34. (Tr at 4-5, 21-22, 47; Gov 1.) On May 10, 2006, Applicant submitted a questionnaire for public trust position, Standard Form 85P. She listed her delinquent debts on her trustworthiness application. (Gov 1, question19-20.) Applicant has the following delinquent accounts: a $7,789 charged off credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 2); a $3,843 credit card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gov 2 at 3, 8; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 3); a $9,904 debt related to a timeshare maintenance fee (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 4 at 2); a $6,757 delinquent account related to an automobile repossession (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Gov 4 at 2); and a $14,308 debt related to a timeshare that was foreclosed in April 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 2 at 4, 12).

On March 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 29, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 15, \n2008. I received the case assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non June 5, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 25, 2008. The \n \n1 \n \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Gov) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection.  \nApplicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted one document that was admitted as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A without objection. The record was held open until June 16, 2008. \nApplicant timely submitted a two page document that was admitted as AE B. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 3, 2008. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. \nShe partially admits but denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e.  She denies SOR allegations \u00b6 1.b. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor who is \nseeking a position of public trust. She has worked as a project manager for her current \nemployer since April 2006.  She was awarded a masters degree in business administration \n(MBA) in January 2008. She is divorced and has a daughter, age 34. (Tr at 4-5, 21-22, 47; \nGov 1.)  \n \nOn May 10, 2006, Applicant submitted a questionnaire for public trust position, \nStandard Form 85P. She listed her delinquent debts on her trustworthiness application. \n(Gov 1, question19-20.) Applicant has the following delinquent accounts: a $7,789 charged \noff credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 2); a $3,843 credit card \naccount placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gov 2 at 3, 8; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 3); \na $9,904 debt related to a timeshare maintenance fee (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 4 at 2); a $6,757 \ndelinquent account related to an automobile repossession (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Gov 4 at 2); and a \n$14,308 debt related to a timeshare that was foreclosed in April 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 2 at \n4, 12). The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e are related to the same timeshare.  The \ntimeshare was foreclosed in 2004. (Gov 2 at 12.) \n \nIn the 1990s, Applicant was employed in a sales position. Her base pay was \napproximately $60,000 and she received an annual bonus of approximately $50,000. In late \n1999, Applicant was laid off. For eight months in 2000, she was either unemployed or \nworked low wage jobs. She was unable to pay her bills as a result of unemployment and \nthe reduction in income. (Tr at 32-33, 39-41; Gov 1, question 6.)  \n \nFrom 2002 to present, Applicant gradually worked her way up to better paying \npositions. She currently earns $63,000 per year. (Tr at 23, 33-34.)  Applicant attended a \nfinancial management program for approximately six months when she first moved to \nArizona. (Tr at 54-55.) \n \nOf the debts alleged in the SOR, SOR \u00b6 1.a is paid. Applicant settled this account for \n$3,500. (Tr at 14, 18, 35; Gov 3 at 2.) Since January 2007, Applicant has been making \n\n \n3 \n \npayments of $100 per month to the collection agency now handling the debt alleged in SOR \nparagraph 1.b. (Tr at 15-16, 28; AE A.)  \n \nApplicant has consulted an attorney regarding the timeshare foreclosure debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. She initially consulted an attorney in the state where she \ncurrently resides. The attorney advised her to seek legal advice from an attorney licensed \nto practice in the state where the timeshare is located. Applicant purchased this timeshare \nin 1997 or 1998. At the time she could afford the timeshare because she was making over \n$100,000 a year. She stopped making payments in 2000 after she was laid off and could no \nlonger afford to make payments. (Tr at 18-19, 39.) After the hearing, Applicant submitted a \nstatute pertaining to timeshare foreclosures in the state where the timeshare is located. (AE \nB.) Applicant is willing to the pay the timeshare debt if it is determined it is her debt. (Tr at \n43.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.d is related to an automobile repossession. The car was \nrepossessed in 2000. In 2001, Applicant made payments of $150 per month but was \nunable to keep up the payments. She has not made a payment since 2001. She has not \nworked on resolving that debt yet. (Tr at 20, 43-44.)  \n \nWhen Applicant started work with her current employer, she had 12 debts that \nneeded to be resolved. She would save up money and work with the creditors to negotiate \nsettlements and/or payment agreements.  She resolved seven of the 12 debts prior to the \nSOR being issued. (Tr at 20-21, 49.) She is current on all of her other bills not listed in the \nSOR. (Tr at 45.)  \n \nAfter obtaining her MBA in January 2008, Applicant hopes to move up in the \ncompany. She recently interviewed for a position and is waiting for a second interview. If \nshe gets promoted, she will get a 15% increase in pay. (Tr at 50-51.)  \n \nApplicant has sufficient income to pay her monthly obligations. (Tr at 25-28; Gov 2 at \n5.) She will begin paying back her student loans in July 2008. Her payments will be $350 \nper month. She will reduce the $500 monthly tithe to her church in order to meet her \nstudent loan payments. She receives a quarterly bonus which is approximately $400 to \n$600. She uses her bonus to resolve her accounts. She recently began a part-time \nbusiness which she hopes will bring in extra income. (Tr at 29-31.)          \n  \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as Asensitive positions.@  \n(See Regulation && C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  AThe standard that must be met for . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person=s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive \nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.@ (See Regulation & \nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply \nto cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel \n\n \n4 \n \nManagement.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. (See Regulation & C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge=s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The \nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \n\n \n5 \n \nin AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.  She has had difficulty paying her debts since 2000. The SOR alleged \nfive debts, a total approximate balance of $42,601.  The majority of the debt involves a \nrepossessed timeshare and a repossessed automobile.       \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s history of \nfinancial irresponsibility is too recent to apply this mitigating condition. Although, she has \ntaken steps to resolve her delinquent accounts, she has several accounts that remain \nunresolved.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances) applies based on Applicant\u2019s eight-month period of \nunderemployment after she was laid off in 1999.  She earned over $100,000 in annual \nincome at the time she was laid off.  It took Applicant some time to find a full-time job that \nthat had a good income. She still does not earn close to $100,000 in annual income. Once \nshe found a job that paid a reasonable income, she took steps to resolve her delinquent \naccounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) \napplies. Applicant attended a financial management class for approximately six months. \nShe established a plan to resolve her delinquent accounts. She resolved one account in the \nSOR and is making payments towards another debt. She resolved several other accounts \nthat were not included in the SOR. The remaining debts relate to an automobile \nrepossession and a timeshare foreclosure. Applicant now earns sufficient income to meet \nher expenses.  Her financial situation is under control.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \n\n \n6 \n \nor otherwise resolve debts) applies. Although she has not resolved the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d and 1.e, she resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and has been making \npayments for the past year and half on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  Credit is given to the fact \nthat Applicant resolved several delinquent accounts prior to the SOR being issued once she \nhad the income to start making payments towards her delinquent accounts.  Her approach \nwas to save her extra income in order to discuss settlement with one or two of her \ncreditors. This is a reasonable approach because Applicant\u2019s income was insufficient to \nresolve the delinquent accounts all at once.  Although she has not fully resolved the debts \nrelated to the timeshare foreclosure, she has consulted legal counsel about her liability for \nsuch debt.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s systematic efforts towards resolving her delinquent accounts shows a \ngood-faith effort to improve her financial situation. She has mitigated the concerns raised \nunder Guideline F.    \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nwere the result of being laid off from a highly paid job and, not being able to find \nemployment providing a similar income. I considered Applicant\u2019s efforts to obtain her MBA \nwhich has the potential to increase her income. She has taken steps to resolve her financial \nsituation. While not all of the delinquent accounts are resolved, she demonstrated a good \nfaith effort to resolve her financial situation. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n                            \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. \nEligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C.

On January \n28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge \nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nApril 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 5, 2008. In two separate \nsworn, written statements, dated February 12, 2008, and February 21, 2008, \nrespectively, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was \nprepared to proceed on February 26, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 27, 2008. A Notice of Hearing was issued on February 28, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 20, 2008. During the hearing, three \nGovernment exhibits were received without objection. Applicant testified, but offered no \nexhibits. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on March 28, 2008. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel noted that Applicant\u2019s SSN in the SOR was incorrect and \nmoved to amend the SOR.

His financial condition improved briefly in \nDecember 2003 until March 2004 when he secured a position as a sales manager with \nanother company with a salary of $110,000 per year, annu\n7\n \nWith his own diminished or zero income, and his wife earning very little as a \nsubstitute teacher, his finances took an enormous hit.  Payments were delayed and \nsome of Applicant\u2019s bills became delinquent. Several tax liens were filed (and ultimately \nsatisfied and released).8 After having made timely payments for about 10 years, he \ndefaulted on his California boat loan and the boat was repossessed in about June 2004, \nand the timeshares, located in Nevada by Lake Tahoe, were foreclosed upon in June \n2005. His wife\u2019s medical conditions (knee replacement and diagnosis of Bipolar \nDisorder) generated other bills.9  At one point, his indebtedness was in excess of \n$200,000.00.10 Applicant discussed his plight with an attorney and considered declaring \nbankruptcy, but decided not to do so because, in his mind, it was not the right option, \nmorally.11 Instead, he chose to attempt to satisfy his creditors. \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant was able to sell his residence in a western state and \nrelocate to a southern state closer to the residence of his parents.  With the funds \nrealized from the sale of his residence, he was able to pay off many of his delinquent \ndebts. 12  \n \nAlthough the SOR identified four purportedly continuing delinquencies, prior to \nJune 2004, he apparently had an unspecified number of other debts.  The four debts \nlisted in the SOR, and their respective current status, according to the Credit Report, \ndated October 19, 2007 (the most current one in evidence), are described below: \n \n \n3 Tr. at 40-41. \n \n4 Id. at 41. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. at 45. \n \n7 Id.; Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86, dated February 23, 2007, at 3).  \n  \n8 Government Exhibit 3 (Interrogatories, dated October 23, 2007, at pp. 50-52). \n \n9 Tr. at 48-49. \n \n10 Id. at 47. \n \n11 Id. at 48, 53. \n \n12 Id. at 45, 50. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTYPE DEBT \nAMOUNT \nSTATUS13\n1.a. \nboat loan ($145,700) \nopened May 1994 \n$73,808.00 \nrepossessed Jun 2004 \n\u201ccharged off\u201d \n1.b. \nVisa card opened Aug 1994 \n$21,537.00 \n\u201ccharged off\u201d Nov 2004 \n1.c. \ntimeshare loan opened Nov 2000  \n$10,187.00 \nforeclosed Jun 2005 \nzero balance \n1.d. \ntimeshare loan opened Nov 2000  \n$13,501.00 \nforeclosed Jun 2005 \nzero balance \n \nWhile not as substantial as they were before 9/11, Applicant\u2019s earnings have \nrebounded to a more reasonable level.  In 2006 he earned about $45,000.00, and the \nfollowing year, he earned about $85,000.00.14 As a result of his financial situation, \nApplicant has changed his lifestyle and curtailed discretionary spending.  He maintains \nonly one credit card (which has been in a current status since 1983), his vehicles are 12 \nyears old and paid off, and he no longer takes expensive vacations to Europe or Hawaii. \nHe generally remains within a budget,15 and he has a monthly balance of about \n$2,341.00 in discretionary funds available for his use.16 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n                                                          \n13 Government Exhibit 3 (Experian Credit Report, at 2, 4-6), supra note 2, is the source for all information in \nthis table.  Government Exhibit 2 (Experian/Trans Union/Equifax Combined Credit Report, dated March 20, 2007) \nwas also reviewed but that report was older than the Experian Credit Report of October 2007, and not as easy to \ndecipher. \n \n14 Tr. at 46. \n \n15 Id. at 55-56.  \n \n16 Government Exhibit 3 (Personal Financial Statement, dated October 23, 2007), supra note 2. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d17 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n \n17 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial condition collapsed after 9/11 when his financial \nobligations, which had previously been addressed without difficulty in a timely manner, \nbecame overextended, and payments became delayed. He accumulated substantial \ndelinquent debt and was unable to attend to those obligations for an extended period of \ntime. The repossession of the boat and the foreclosures on his timeshares, as well as \nthe debts being \u201ccharged off\u201d all led credence to a conclusion that the evidence is \nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer \nexamination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial situation prior to 9/11 was such that he could enjoy expensive activities without \ncausing disruption to his finances.  However, shortly after September 11, 2001, his \nfinancial situation unexpectedly collapsed and spiraled out of control generally until \n2004 when it leveled off. He accumulated substantial delinquent debt due, in large \nmeasure, to lengthy and sporadic unemployment and underemployment, as well as to \nhis wife=s medical issues. These circumstances are no longer extant. I find the behavior \noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not \nraise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The \nevidence establishes this mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ As noted above, the financial problems arose because of the \ndevastating impact 9/11 had on the economy, in general, and his employer, specifically, \nhis lengthy and sporadic periods of unemployment and underemployment, and his \nwife=s medical issues. He acted responsibly in identifying and eventually resolving his \ndebts. I find this mitigating condition applies in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \ns. \n                                                          \notherwise resolve debts.@18 Applicant consulted with an attorney regarding his financial \ndelinquencies and considered filing bankruptcy to eliminate those debts. Rather than \ntaking the easy way out, he rejected such action on moral grounds.  Instead, he sold his \nresidence and resolved nearly all the delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. \nWhile his level of income may not have reached the one he had before 9/11, his actions \nin addressing his debts, while too slow or incomplete for the Government, indicate \ngood-faith efforts on his part as well as showing clear indications the problem is now \nlargely under control.  I find these mitigating conditions partially apply in this case. \n \nThe Government attributes substantial importance and credibility to entries in the \nCredit Reports and appears concerned that Applicant permitted the $73,808.00 balance \nof the loan for his repossessed boat, and the unpaid $21,537.00 balance of his credit \ncard to be \u201ccharged off.\u201d19 Also, that he defaulted on a combined $23,688.00 balance \non his foreclosed timeshare\n \nAs to the boat repossession (and its \u201ccharged off\u201d balance) and the \u201ccharged off\u201d \ncredit card balance, it appears the debts were never reduced to judgments and, in the \ncase of the boat, the repossession served to give title to the boat to the creditor, the \noriginal lender, a bank located in California. \n \nIn the case of the credit card or open-ended contract, the creditor, also a bank \nlocated in California, merely charged the delinquent balance off in November 2004. \nWhile the credit report may reflect the balances as delinquent, as of September 2007, it \nappears the debts are barred by California\u2019s 4-year statute of limitations,20 making them \nlegally uncollectible.21 \n \n18 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n19 It is commonly acknowledged that a \u201ccharge off\u201d is a practice where the creditor gives up on collection \nefforts, takes a tax write-off on the debt, and/or sells the debt to a third party.  The debt still exists, but the creditor has \nreceived a tax benefit and possibly sold the debt to the third party.  \n  \n20 See Cal. Code Ann. \u00a7 337 (2008) (written obligation; four years) and Lynch v. Watson, 78 Cal. App. 2d 96, \n177 P. 2d 657 (1947) (action for breach of contract is barred where it commenced more than four years after \nexecution and breach of contract). \n \n21 The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of \nthe statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate activity, \npunish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  The \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nAs to the Applicant\u2019s interests in the Nevada timeshares that have been \nforeclosed in June 2005, those foreclosure actions appear to have been accomplished \nas non-judicial foreclosures under deeds of trust,22 and they caused him to forfeit the \nequity in those timeshares he had held prior to the foreclosures. The creditor took \nownership of the timeshares, and as reflected in the credit report, there are no \noutstanding balances. If there had been, that fact does not appear in the Credit Reports \nand the creditor never approached the Applicant seeking payment for any purported \ndeficiency. Any such action at this late date are barred by Nevada\u2019s 6-month statute of \nlimitations pertaining to deficiencies,23 making them legally uncollectible. \n \nI have reviewed the two Credit Reports in evidence, and even with extensive \nexperience in deciphering the entries, found them to be garbled and internally \ninconsistent, with minimum indicia of reliability.  There is no indication as to the \nsource(s) of the information appearing therein, for as the Experian Credit Report states:  \n\u201cExperian collects and organizes information about you and your credit history from \npublic records, your creditors and other reliable sources.\u201d24 The combined report does \nnot disclose even that much information. Thus, the factual or legal accuracy, currency, \nor reliability of the information is left to mere speculation. Accordingly, they are \nunreliable and untrustworthy, and in this particular instance, inaccurate as well.  \n \nApplicant is now financially sound and prepared for future contingencies. I \nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n \ncornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to \npromote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential \ndefendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend \ntime-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  \nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). \n \n22 See Nev. Rev. Stat.  \u00a7 119A.170 (4) (2001) (The \u201creal property\u201d and \u201creal estate\u201d as used in Nev. Rev. \nStat.

Stat.  \u00a7 107.080 (2007) (discussing default and sale under deeds of trust). \n \n23 See Nev. Rev. Stat.  \u00a7 40.455 (1987) (The deficiency judgment must be sought within six months after the \ndate of foreclosure).  \n \n24 Government Exhibit 3 (Experian Credit Report, at 1), supra note 2. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was a very successful professional earning $180,000.00 per year. (See AG & \n2(a)(4).) He accumulated extensive debt due to circumstances largely beyond his \ncontrol, including the negative economic impact on the national economy and his \nemployer, as well as lengthy and sporadic periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment, and his wife=s medical issues. (See AG & 2(a)(2).)  Although limited \nby his circumstances, since that time, Applicant has undergone significant behavioral \nchanges. He changed his lifestyle and curtailed discretionary spending. But most \nsignificantly, he has taken affirmative action and made substantial good-faith efforts to \npay off or resolve most of his delinquent debts, including those raising security \nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) While it is the Government\u2019s contentions that he still has \nthe four outstanding debts identified in the SOR, those debts were never reduced to \njudgments and the Statute of Limitations for each of the debts has expired, making them \nuncollectible. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Thus, these debts cannot be sources of improper \npressure or duress. \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether \nhis financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \nI am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s \ncredit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in \nlight of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.25 Considering what Applicant has gone through financially and emotionally, \nand mindful of his refusal to simply walk away from his debts through bankruptcy, and \naware of his continuing good-faith efforts, and altered lifestyle, his past financial \nsituation is insufficient to raise continuing security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n \n25 See U.S. v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 57, married and has a high school diploma plus career training. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Applicant married his current wife in 1999. For several years after they got married, the Applicant\u2019s wife did not have enough taxes withheld from her pay check. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 15-17; Transcript at 43-47.) This resulted in the Applicant and his wife owing several years of back taxes to the state and Federal tax authorities. In addition, the Applicant\u2019s wife had tax problems that pre-dated their marriage. (Government Exhibit 2 at page 6.) Because of these problems, the Internal Revenue Service and the state filed various levies and tax liens against the Applicant and his wife. The Applicant and his wife owed approximately $25,000.00 in taxes, interest and penalties by 2008. (Government Exhibit 2 at 12-13 and Government Exhibit 5 at 1.) The Applicant and his wife retained a tax attorney in 2004 to assist them in resolving the tax problems. (Government Exhibit 2 at 9-10; Transcript at 48-51.) The attorney began negotiating agreements with the state and Federal taxing authorities. (Government Exhibit 2 at 11, 14.) Beginning in 2007, the Applicant began paying state back taxes through garnishment. (Government Exhibit 2 at 7; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) The state tax lien was successfully paid off in May 2008.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nOctober 27, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on December 15, 2005 (Government Exhibit 1).  On February 8, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 20, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on April 1, 2008.  I received the case assignment on April 8, 2008.\n\n2\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 18, 2008, setting the hearing for May 13,\n2008.  The Applicant requested a continuance to serve on jury duty, which I granted.\nAn amended notice of hearing was issued on May 22, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on June 20, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on June 30, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the\nrecord open until July 7, 2008, to submit additional matters.  On July 1, July 3 and July\n7, 2008, he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits I, J and K, without objection. The record\nclosed on July 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 57, married and has a high school diploma plus career training.\nHe is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant married his current wife in 1999.  For several years after they got\nmarried, the Applicant\u2019s wife did not have enough taxes withheld from her pay check.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 15-17; Transcript at 43-47.)  This resulted in the Applicant and\nhis wife owing several years of back taxes to the state and Federal tax authorities.  In\naddition, the Applicant\u2019s wife had tax problems that pre-dated their marriage.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at page 6.)  \nBecause of these problems, the Internal Revenue Service and the state filed\nvarious levies and tax liens against the Applicant and his wife.  The Applicant and his\nwife owed approximately $25,000.00 in taxes, interest and penalties by 2008.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 12-13 and Government Exhibit 5 at 1.) \nThe Applicant and his wife retained a tax attorney in 2004 to assist them in\nresolving the tax problems.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 9-10; Transcript at 48-51.)  The\nattorney began negotiating agreements with the state and Federal taxing authorities.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 11, 14.)  Beginning in 2007, the Applicant began paying state\nback taxes through garnishment.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 7; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)\nThe state tax lien was successfully paid off in May 2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A;\nTranscript at 51-52.)  \nThe Applicant and his wife entered into an Installment Agreement with the IRS on\nDecember 24, 2007.  This agreement stated that they would pay $683.00 per month to\nthe IRS for their joint back taxes of $18,413.66, starting March 28, 2011.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit F.)  The Applicant subsequently elected to amend that agreement, so that\n\n3\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\npayments of $300.00 a month on back taxes would start three years earlier, on July 28,\n2008.  He credibly testified that payments would be made in accordance with this\nagreement. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 11-17; Transcript at 57-62.)\n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife has also been paying an IRS garnishment for her separate\nback taxes. (Government Exhibit 2 at 8.)  This tax indebtedness pre-dated her marriage.\nOn December 24, 2007, she entered into a separate agreement with the IRS\nconcerning these taxes.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 4-7.) The Applicant\u2019s wife made\npayments according to this agreement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 10-14, 19.)  This\nagreement was also modified.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 4-9.) (Is his wife able to pay her\nown tax debt without her husband\u2019s financial assistance?)\nThe Applicant testified and submitted evidence that he is able to pay his current\nindebtedness, and pay his tax debt.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 3; Transcript at 62-65.)\nHis most recent credit bureau report, dated April 1, 2008, reveals no past due debt,\nother than the tax debt. (Government Exhibit 7.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentation showing that he is a highly respected\nemployee.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I at 20-23.)  A former supervisor describes the Applicant\nas, \u201ca good man, an excellent asset to the government, and a true American.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  The Applicant\u2019s performance reviews from 2004 through 2008\nshow that he is consistently rated as \u201cMeets/Occasionally Exceeds Expectations\u201d or\n\u201cExceeds Expectations.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and J.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own common\n\n4\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\nsense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n5\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19\u00a9, Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant was unable to pay his tax debts for several years,\nresulting in the filing of state and Federal tax liens. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between about 1999 and 2004. There is no evidence that he has\nbeen unable to pay his taxes in a timely manner since then.  The evidence shows that\nthe tax problems were based, to a great extent, on his wife\u2019s actions before they were\nmarried.  Those problems have been resolved.  I find the behavior occurred under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about\nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20\u00a9. Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ The Applicant never denied he owed these tax debts.  For the\npast several years, he has been negotiating with the state and Federal taxing authorities\nto resolve the situation.  The state tax debt has been completely paid off.  The Applicant\nand his wife have entered into reasonable payment arrangements with the IRS that he\nwill be able to pay without serious problems.  Therefore, the tax debt has been\nsuccessfully resolved.  I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n6\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2c, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant, by his own\nadmission, took several years to decide to resolve his tax situation. Since 2004, his\ntaxes have been paid in a timely fashion and he is current on all of his other\nindebtedness.  Of course, the issue is not simply whether all the Applicant\u2019s debts are\npaid - it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a\nsecurity clearance.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), this conduct is not recent.  While it would have\nbeen better if he had paid his tax debt earlier, he has paid the state off now.  The\nsituation regarding his Federal taxes has been resolved to the Government\u2019s\nsatisfaction.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to\nno potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)), and that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)8)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In 1949, the \nChinese Communist Party was victorious and established a government on the \nmainland.  The Nationalist Chinese fled to Taiwan and established a government.  \nTaiwan has developed steadily since then and is now the world\u2019s 17th largest economy.  \nTaiwan became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2002, further expanding \nits trade opportunities and further strengthening its standing in the global economy.  \nThis prosperity established economic and social stability.   \n \n \nUntil 1986, Taiwan's political system was effectively controlled by one party, the \nKuomintang.  Since ending martial law in 1987, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to \nimprove respect for human rights and create a democratic political system. The United \nStates has been committed to maintaining cultural, commercial, and other nonofficial \nrelations with Taiwan since January 1979, when it formally recognized the government \nof the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China. By \nformal act of Congress (Taiwan Relations Act of 1979), the United States is committed \nto provide Taiwan with military defensive arms in support of Taiwan's security and \nstability in the region.  The United States also stated it would maintain cultural, \ncommercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.  Despite the United \nStates clear and consistent position that Taiwan and the mainland are part of one \nChina, United States commercial ties have expanded with Taiwan and the United States \nis supportive of Taiwan's membership in international organizations, such as the World \nTrade Organization and the Asian Development Bank.  (See Hearing Exhibits, United \nStates, Department of State's Background Note: Taiwan, dated October 2007.)   \n \nWhile still pursuing a closer relationship with Taiwan, the official United States \nposition on Taiwan and mainland China seems to be a criticism of mainland China\u2019s \nbuildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and warnings to the effect that United \nStates support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  Smooth United States \nand PRC relations are an important tool in cooperating against terrorism and \nmaintaining stability in Pacific region.  Faced with competing pressures and the \ncontinuing transformation on both the PRC and Taiwan systems, the United States \ngovernment may be facing new and more difficult policy choices concerning Taiwan in \nthe next few years. (See Hearing Exhibits, Congressional Research Service Report to \nCongress: Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, \n2006) \n \nThe government claims through Administrative Notice that Taiwan poses a threat \nto national security because, in the past, it was one of the countries most actively \nengaged in industrial espionage and the collection of foreign economic information.1  It \n \n1 See, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage.  While the \nreport is undated, the government\u2019s request for administrative notice refers to the document as a 2000 \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \npresented information concerning individuals in the United States convicted of engaging \nin espionage practices with Taiwanese companies or officials.  It is also noted that \nTaiwan has a democratic political system, has made dramatic steps toward improving \nits respect for human rights, has ended restrictions on freedom of the press and the \nformation of new political parties, and has relaxed restrictions on personal freedoms. \n(See, United States State Department Background Notes, Taiwan, dated April 2007; \nUnited States Department of State, Country Report on Human Rights Practices-2006, \nChina (Taiwan Only) dated March 6, 2007).  The relationship between the United States \nand Taiwan is defined in the Taiwan Relations Act which recognizes Taiwan. (Public \nLaw 96-8)  Taiwan has a long history of friendly relations with the United States, \nincluding substantial levels of foreign trade.  Taiwan is an ally and friend but also poses \na security threat because of efforts to obtain national security information.  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n \nreport.  There are a number of examples in this report of espionage on U.S. economic and industrial \nactivities by Taiwanese officials or companies. Also of note is a Private Industry Survey by officials of the \nNational Counterintelligence Center listing Taiwan as one of the most active collectors of economic and \nindustrial espionage. The list of most active collectors was developed by contacting nearly a dozen \nselected Fortune 500 companies for their view of the problem of foreign economic collection and \nindustrial espionage. Only a small sampling, 12 of 500, of companies were contacted. The companies \nand individuals contacted are not identified.  The report was given minimal weight. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThere is a security concern because foreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interests.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity \nof the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding but not limited to, such consideration as whether the foreign country is known \nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant has contact through visits and telephone calls with her mother, brother, \ntwo sisters, sister-in-law, and brothers-in-law, who are all citizens and residents of \nTaiwan.  She has contact with an aunt and uncle who are Taiwan citizens that reside in \nJapan.  These contacts raise security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying \nConditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 79(a) (Contact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion); and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) (Connections to a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation).  Each individual contact by itself may not create a heightened risk of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nforeign influence, but the totality of the contacts may indicate a heightened risk of \nforeign influence. \n \n \nI have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.); AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could created a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation) and determine all apply to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  (See, \nISCR Case No. 03-17620, App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006; ISCR Case No. 03-24933, App. Bd. \nJul. 28, 2005; ISCR Case No. 03-02382, App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005; and ISCR Case No. \n03-15205, App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to \napply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n \nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan cause security concerns, I \nconsidered that Taiwan is an ally of the United States, has a defense agreement with \nthe United States, and is one of the United States\u2019 substantial trading partners.  I \nconsidered that Taiwan improved its human rights position and its people enjoy basic \nfreedoms.  While the United States has a one-China policy, the United States does \nmaintain cultural, commercial, and other ties with Taiwan.  I considered that Taiwan \ndoes engage in economic and other types of espionage, and there are instances of \nTaiwan officials and companies engaging in such espionage with individuals in the \nUnited States.  There are no indications in these instances Taiwan was targeting United \nStates citizens to provide economic or other sensitive information.  I also considered \nthat faced with new and competing national interest, the United States policy toward \nTaiwan could change.  While Taiwan is a country that is friendly to the United Stares, it \ncould engage in espionage against United States interests.  Friendly countries may \nhave profound disagreements with the United States or have engaged in espionage \nagainst United States economic, scientific, or technical interest.  A friendly relationship \nis not determinative, but it makes it less likely that a foreign government would attempt \nto exploit a United States citizen through relatives or associates in that country.  Taiwan \n\n \n8 \n \n \nis not a hostile country, nor is its interests inimical to the United States.  The United \nStates and Taiwan are large democracies, enjoy good relations, and are trading \npartners.  It is reasonable to consider that Taiwan would not take any action to \njeopardize their friendly position with the United States because of their need for trade \nand defense assistance from the United States.  It would be considered an act \nunfriendly to the interest of the United States to coerce its citizens with relatives in the \nUnited States to pressure their United States relatives to provide economic or other \nespionage information against the interest of the United States.  While none of the \nconsiderations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be considered \nin determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion from his family members \nin Taiwan. \n \n \nApplicant has raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (the \nnature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe United States).  Applicant\u2019s mother is a retired translator for a company and has no \nties to the Taiwanese government.  She is not dependent on the government for \nsubsistence.  Applicant\u2019s siblings are medical professionals working for private \nbusinesses in Taiwan.  They are not dependent on the Taiwanese government for their \nsubsistence.  Applicant talks to her mother frequently, at least once a week.  She talks \nto her siblings less but it is still often at about every other month.  Applicant made a \nnumber of trips to Taiwan for normal visits to her family, or when they are sick, or for \nfunerals.  Her mother and siblings have come to the United States to visit her.  It is clear \nthat they have a close family relationship.  Her contact with her immediate family is \nfrequent and not casual.  Applicant has little if any contact with her brother-in-law, who \nis a government official.  Since the contact is so minimal, his position as a government \nofficial does not create a security concern.  Applicant\u2019s information concerning her \nfamily members\u2019 living conditions, life style, and professions, shows it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position to choose between the interests of his family and \nfriend and the interests of the United States.  Applicant established her family members \nin Taiwan are ordinary citizens leading normal lives.  They do not present a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  The \npositions and activities of her family and the fact they are in Taiwan show that it is \nunlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of being coerced or pressured to \nchoose between these people and her interests in protecting the national security of the \nUnited States.  FI MC \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant has raised FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest either because \nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, \nor country is minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest).  Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to duress is also \nimportant.  Applicant has been in the United States for over 23 years, and a United \nStates citizen for over 18 years.  She has two children born and educated in the United \n\n \n9 \n \n \nStates, who are citizens of the United States.  Applicant\u2019s assets, her house and \nretirement funds are in the United States and she has no financial interest in Taiwan.  \nShe has held a security clearance for over 13 years without any problems.  Applicant\u2019s \nnumerous and repeated trips to Taiwan were solely for the purpose of visiting family.  \nApplicant has demonstrated that she is not unusually vulnerable to duress. Applicant \nhas a normal sense of loyalty or obligation to her family in Taiwan.  But she also has \nlong standing relationship and connections in the United States.  She has demonstrated \nthat these relationships will lead her to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States.  FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant has raised FI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens \nis so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation) in connection to her aunt and uncle in Japan.  \nApplicant has the burden of presenting information to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by the government.  Applicant has only met her aunt and uncle \none time at the funeral of her grandmother.  At best, this is only minimal contact and she \nhardly knows them.  The contact is so casual and infrequent there is little likelihood that \nit could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  Because of the lack of a \nrelationship with her aunt and uncle, there is no reason to discuss the security \nsignificance of the nature of the relationship between Japan and the United States.  \nAccordingly, FI MC 8(c) applies to her aunt and uncle in Japan.   \n \n \nAccordingly, Applicant has met her heavy burden to show that her family \ncontacts in Taiwan and Japan do not cause a security concern.  I conclude FI MC AGs \n\u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept \nrequires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single item in \nisolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security \n\n \n10 \n \n \nworthiness.  Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan both individually and collectively are in \npositions and circumstances that make it unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position \nto choose between the interests of her family and the interest of the United States, or \nthat she can be exploited, pressured, or coerced because of them.  Her contacts with \nher family in Taiwan are strong but they do not create a conflict of interest between the \nfamily members and her loyalty to the United States.  Applicant has been in the United \nStates for over 28 years and a citizen of the United States for over 18 years.  Her \nchildren were born here and are United States citizens.  She has accumulated \nsignificant assets in the United States, and has no property interests in Taiwan.  Her \nsupervisor and her employer consider her to be a good worker and not a security risk.  \nShe has successfully held a security clearance for over 13 years.  She does not discuss \nher work with her family in Taiwan.  She travels to Taiwan periodically to visit family \nrather than any connection to the Taiwanese government.  She established that her \ncontacts with her family in Taiwan and Japan do not indicate a security risk.  Applicant\u2019s \nlife story is an example of the success of many immigrants to the United States.  She \ncame to the United States to better herself through education.  She remained here and \nbecame a United States citizen.  The family enjoys a typical United States life style.  \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 15, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on October 30,\n2006. On February 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) with attachments, in writing on March\n7, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was\nassigned to this Administrative Judge on June 24, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on July 9, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on August 12,\n2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii. The government offered Exhibits 1 through 9, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\nA and B, which were entered into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\n\n2\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on August 29, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 45 years old. He is currently married for the second time, and he has\nfive children. He served in the United States Marines from 1979 to 2000, and he\nreceived an Honorable Discharge.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists five allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.e., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the debts will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $235. In\nhis RSOR and during his testimony, Applicant argued that he has disputed this bill for a\nconverter cable box, as he returned the box at the time. Attachment A of the RSOR\nshows a receipt from this creditor, indicating that this converter box was received on\nSeptember 15, 2001. Attachment B is part of a Consumer Credit Report, showing that\nApplicant has disputed this bill to the credit reporting agency.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $17,260.\nApplicant explained during his testimony that there were several reasons why this bill for\nchild support became overdue. He stated that the bill started out with it being $3,500 in\narrears, because the child support agency took such a long time telling him how much\nhe should be paying. Then the amount he was ordered to pay did not reduce the\narrearage which continued to grow. He also paid for the first two years, but he did not\nget credit for those payments\nApplicant testified that he has never missed making every required monthly\npayment, since he was first ordered to pay for child support. He has been making two\npayments a month, both the one that is required each month and a second payment to\nreduce the arrearage, which Applicant stated has been educed to $14,000. Exhibit 5\nshows the two monthly payments that had been $585 and were reduced after he retired\nto  $345 that Applicant has been paying on this debt. He is now paying $210 a month to\nreduce the arrearage. \n\n3\nFinally, he testified that he planned to refinance his home in March or April of\n2009, and use the proceeds to pay off the arrearage. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,420.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he had been disputing this bill from a phone\ncompany, which he did not believe was accurate. He testified that even though he did\nnot believe this bill was accurate, he did pay this bill. Exhibit B is a letter from the\nattorneys for this creditor, dated March 19, 2008, indicating that they have received\n$1,320 on March 12, 2008, as payment in full on this debt.  I conclude that this debt has\nbeen paid in full. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $30.\nApplicant testified that this debt and the debt marked as 1.e., below were for co-\npayments that were supposed to be paid by his former wife. However, since she did not\nmeet her obligation, he has now paid this debt. Exhibit A is a letter from the collection\nagency of the creditor of this debt, dated June 24, 2008, indicating that they have\nreceived $60 on April 21, 2008, as payment in full on this debt, and the debt which is\nlisted below as 1.e.  I conclude that this debt has been paid in full.  \n \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $30. As\ndiscussed in 1.d., above, this debt has also been paid in full. \nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed SCA on October 30, 2006 (Exhibit 1).  Question\n28.a. asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Question 28.b. asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both of these questions, and he listed no debts.\nThe Government alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed as 1.a.\nthrough 1.e., discussed above in the SOR.\nApplicant testified that he believed he was current on all of his debts or else that\nhe was legitimately disputing them, and that he did not consider himself overdue on his\ndebts when he completed the SCA.  He had no intention of giving false or incorrect\ninformation to the Government when he completed the SCA.\nApplicant explained that with the exception of the child support bill, he is current\non all of his debts. His previous financial difficulties were incurred because of his divorce\nand the child support arrearage which arose through no fault of Applicant. He testified\nthat he was able to purchase a home in March of 2008 for $400,000, and he is making\nmonthly payments of $2,699 a month. He has not missed any payments on his\nmortgage.  \nFinally, two witnesses testified at the hearing on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  One has\nknown Applicant since the early 1980s during their active duty in the Marines. He is now\nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor. He described Applicant as forthright, and trustworthy,\nand he stated that Applicant does his job impeccably.  The second witness has known\n\n4\nApplicant since1979 during their active duty in the Marines. He is now a coworker of\nApplicant. He described the Applicant as a \u201cstand up gentleman\u201d who is honest and\ntrustworthy. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting financial\nobligations and his inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts. \nI find that Mitigating Condition (MC) (d) applies as Applicant has initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay the overdue creditors and resolve his debts, with only one debt that\nremains outstanding. Additionally, I find that the debt arose due to errors made by the\nchild support agency. Not only did Applicant never miss a child support payment, but he\nactually paid child support for the first two years before he was ordered to do so, and he\nnever received credit for those two years of payment. I, therefore, hold Guideline F for\nApplicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant did not\nknowingly provide incorrect material information to the Government on the SCA that he\nexecuted on October 30, 2006. Of the five debts cited on the SOR, Applicant had a\nlegitimated dispute with two, and he did know that his wife had not paid the other two,\ndespite her agreement to do so. While the child support bill can be considered overdue,\nApplicant did not create this situation, and he believed it was being resolved.  I find that\nApplicant did not intend to mislead the Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against\nApplicant. I therefore, resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s 20 year history in the\nMarines, the testimony of his two character witnesses, his resolution of all of his\noverdue debts except one, which he is working diligently to resolve, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nFor  Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is employed as a System Analyst and seeks to retain a Top Secret level clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. The Applicant denied subparagraph 1.a. as amended, and admitted subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. 3 Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct which shows questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The Applicant has worked in the Defense industry since 1987. For most of that time he has held a security clearance. From approximately 2001 to August 2004 the Applicant also had access to Special Access Programs (SAP). (Transcript at 65-66.) The Applicant went to Vietnam as a tourist in February 2003.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nJuly 14, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 11,\n2005 and amended it on May 8, 2007 (Government Exhibit 1). On January 3, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant, which detailed security concerns under Guidelines E and B stating why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be denied or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 11, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 21, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 17,\n2008, and I received the case assignment on March 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on April 4, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 21, 2008.\nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received\nwithout objection. The Applicant testified.  Five witnesses testified on the Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf and he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F, without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 30, 2008.  The record closed on that\ndate.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting the original SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a., and substituting the following, \u201cYou deliberately failed to report your\nintended marriage to a foreign national to appropriate security personnel because you\nfelt it was your own personal business unrelated to your employment.\u201d  \nThe Applicant did not object to the amendment, and stated he did not need\nadditional time to respond to the amendment.  The motion to amend was granted, and\nthe Applicant denied the additional subparagraph.  (Transcript at 8-10.)\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam). (Transcript at 10-11.)\nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were\nincluded in the record as Administrative Notice Exhibits I through V.  The Applicant also\nasked that two additional documents be admitted as Administrative Notice Exhibits VI\nand VII. (Transcript at 147-150.)  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 49, married, and has an Associate of Science degree.  He is\nemployed as a System Analyst and seeks to retain a Top Secret level clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense industry.  The Applicant denied\nsubparagraph 1.a. as amended, and admitted subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. of the\nSOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.  \n\n3\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in conduct which shows questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant has worked in the Defense industry since 1987.  For most of that\ntime he has held a security clearance.  From approximately 2001 to August 2004 the\nApplicant also had access to Special Access Programs (SAP).  (Transcript at 65-66.)\nThe Applicant went to Vietnam as a tourist in February 2003.  He traveled with\nhis house mate, an American woman of Vietnamese descent who also works in the\nDefense industry and has a security clearance.  At that time she and the Applicant had\nbeen house mates since 1997.  While in Vietnam the Applicant met his house mate\u2019s\nniece.\nAfter returning to the United States, the Applicant and the niece began to have a\npersonal relationship by use of the Internet, telephone and the mail.  By about July 2003\nthe Applicant and the niece decided to marry.  At this point the Applicant began the\nprocedure to get the niece a fianc\u00e9 visa that would allow her to move to the United\nStates.  The niece, now his fianc\u00e9, came to the United States in May 2004.  The\nApplicant and the niece were married July 1, 2004.  At the first available date after the\nmarriage, the Applicant informed his company\u2019s security officials of his marriage.  The\nApplicant admits that this was the first time anyone in his company, or the Government,\nhad notice that he was having any type of personal relationship with a foreign national.\nAs stated earlier, at the time he married his current wife, the Applicant had\naccess to a SAP.  These programs have security procedures above those of collateral\nsecurity clearances, such as Top Secret.  One of these procedures is the requirement\nthat holder of SAP access must report as soon as possible the existence of a personal\nrelationship with a foreign national.  Because the Applicant did not do that, \u201cAs of 19\nAug 2004, a temporary suspension of Access to Special Access Programs (SAP) has\nbeen imposed due to unreported foreign contacts.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 1 at page 10,\nquestion 43.) \nThe Applicant has given several reasons for his failure not to report his\nrelationship with his wife until after his marriage.  First of all, based on his testimony,\nand that of his witnesses, it is clear that the Applicant is a very private person.  He\nkeeps a strict separation between his personal life and his professional life.  He says, \u201cI\nwish to state that I regret not notifying the appropriate security personnel of my intent of\nmarriage to a foreign national . . .  Rightly or wrongly, I felt this was a private and\npersonal matter and I do not make it a habit of discussing my personal life at work.\u201d\n(Government Exhibit 5 at 4.)\nHe also states, \u201cI did not know, and still do not know of any requirement to report\nthe intent to marry.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Answer at 1.)  He further states that, though he had\n\nSee Transcript at 113-114, 124-125, 140-142.\n1\n4\nbeen given security briefings about having SAP access, he could not recall anything in\nthem regarding the reporting of foreign contacts.  (Transcript at 66.)  However, several\nof the Applicant\u2019s witnesses, including former supervisors, discussed the fact that the\nsecurity briefings concerning SAP access the Applicant received include reporting\n\u201csignificant contact with a foreign national.\u201d  (Transcript at 92-94.)1\nThe Applicant also did not report the fact that his then fianc\u00e9 was living with him\nbefore their marriage in May and June 2004.  He testified, \u201cAt that time, I didn\u2019t really\nconsider her a foreign national at that time.  She had come through the U.S. Consulate\nin Vietnam through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.  So, she was already\nscreened and allowed to come to the United States.\u201d  (Transcript at 43-44.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nAs stated above, the Applicant traveled to Vietnam in 2003, where he met his\nwife.  The Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Vietnam and has a large family still there.  This\nincludes her parents as well as at least 11 siblings still living in Vietnam.  One sister\nlives in the United States.  The evidence shows that the Applicant has very little\nknowledge of his in-laws, including the sexes and employment histories of his wife\u2019s\nsiblings.  (Government Exhibit 1 at 9, Transcript at 47-64.)\nThe Applicant has numerous ties to Vietnam.  It is therefore appropriate to\ndiscuss the relationship of the United States and Vietnam at this time.  Support for these\nstatements can be found in the Administrative Notice documents I through VII.  Vietnam\nis an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam.  It often works with\nChina, its largest trading partner.  U.S.-Vietnam relations have gradually been\nnormalizing since the 1990s, although tensions remain regarding human rights issues.\nArbitrary detentions, particularly with regard to political activities, remain a problem.\nThree American citizens were arrested in Vietnam in 2005 while visiting relatives and\ncharged with plotting violence against the Vietnamese government.  Police sometimes\nmistreat those under arrest or in custody and arbitrary detentions remain a problem.\nFreedom of speech and of the press is restricted, particularly with regard to the Internet\nand cyber-dissidents.  It is not unusual for Vietnamese citizens to be monitored and\nvisitors may be put under surveillance.  Timely notice to the U.S. of the detention of a\nU.S. citizen in Vietnam is rare and access to such detainees can be difficult, particularly\nif they are former citizens of Vietnam.  There has been progress with Vietnam on\nregional security issues, and the Vietnamese government has been helpful in the anti-\nterrorism arena.\n\n5\nMitigation\nSeven witnesses testified and submitted statements on the Applicant\u2019s behalf,\nand two other people submitted written statements.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F.)\nThe witnesses included co-workers and former supervisors, six of whom have known\nthe Applicant for at least 12 years.  Without exception, the Applicant is described by\nthese people as one of the hardest working employees they know.  His supervisors,\nformer and current, state he is one of their best workers: reliable, honest, dependable.\nAll of them recommend that he retain his security clearance, even with knowledge of his\nfailure to report his growing personal relationship with his now wife.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant intentionally failed to report his growing relationship with his\nwife during the year before they were married (Guideline E); and that the Applicant has\nsignificant connections with Vietnam (Guideline B).  The Applicant, on the other hand,\nhas not successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nTurning first to Guideline E, the concern is stated as follows, Conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.\nThe Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s concerns about his intentional\nfailure to report his growing relationship with his wife.  The Applicant is far from the first\nperson with a security clearance to meet and marry someone from overseas, or even\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 08-08128 (June 27, 2008).\n2\n7\nfrom Vietnam.   The difference here is that he intentionally chose to conceal from the\n2\nGovernment and his company\u2019s security officials the fact of his relationship with his wife.\nThe Applicant has stated that he did not know of the requirement to report\nsignificant contacts with a foreign national.  This testimony is simply not credible for\nseveral reasons.  First, as shown in the testimony of four of his witnesses, this\nrequirement is well-known among his co-workers, based on a briefing that all of them\nreceive on an annual basis.  Second, the Applicant is an intelligent man, with many\nyears in the Defense industry.  He is meticulous and driven.  As such, I find that he\nknew, or should have known, what the requirements are.  Third, the Applicant is a\nprivate person, who does not bring his private life to work, and this particular\nrelationship is the essence of a private life.  \nIn addition, the Applicant also testified that he came to the conclusion that,\nbecause his wife received a fianc\u00e9 visa, that somehow abrogated his responsibility to\nreport that she was there to marry him.  This may be closer to the truth, but once again\ndoes not annul the reporting requirements.\nBased on all the available evidence, I find that the Applicant intentionally decided\nnot to report his personal relationship with a foreign national, his wife.  He did this for a\nreason that he is as yet unwilling to articulate to the Government.  Such conduct brings\nhim within the strictures of Disqualifying Condition 16.(c):\nCredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.\nI have considered the Mitigating Conditions under this Guideline.  None of them\napply.  Paragraph 1 is found Against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\n\n8\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant has many and varied connections to Vietnam.  The problem is that\nhe is unsure of what his wife\u2019s relatives do in Vietnam, or even what their sexes are.\nHis wife, as to be expected, is close to her family and talks to them on a regular basis. \nAll of these connections must also be viewed in the context of the Vietnamese\ngovernment, and in particular that government\u2019s history of coercion with regard to it\u2019s\ncitizens, and the detention of Americans.  Once again, his intentional failure to report his\ngrowing relationship with his wife affects his ability to mitigate this guideline as well.\nUnder the current state of the record, he has failed to meet his burden of showing that it\nis unlikely he will be forced to choose between the interests of Vietnam and those of the\nUnited States. \nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nConnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information; (d) Sharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion and (f) Failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national.  I\nhave also considered the information concerning the Vietnamese government, provided\nby Department Counsel and Applicant\u2019s Counsel in Administrative Notice Exhibits I\nthrough VII. \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n7(a) The nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest and (e) The individual has promptly complied with existing agency\nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country.  Paragraph 2 is found against the\nApplicant.\n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I have also kept in mind the fact\nthat it is the Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence mitigating the security significance of\nhis conduct and of his family situation.  He has done neither.\nAs stated earlier, I find that the Applicant made the conscious decision to\nwithhold information from the Government and his employer about his relationship with\nhis wife.  I also find that he was required to do so, and that he knew or should have\nknown he had to report it.  His reasons may have been benign, but it is his responsibility\nto explain his actions, and he has not done so satisfactorily.  (AG \u00b6 2(a)(2) and 2(a)(5).)\nGiven the failure to explain his conduct, and also his inability to show that he is\nnot vulnerable to coercion, I cannot find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nFinally, given the particular facts of this case, it is impossible for me to find that there is\nlittle or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The SOR\n1\nalleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted an undated response to the SOR, admitted all allegations and requested a\nhearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nAugust 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing for September 25, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4 and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified and submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. The record\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nNovember 10, 2008\n\n2\nwas held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentary\nevidence in support of his case. One document was timely received, marked as AE 6 and\nadmitted into the record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum\nof AE 6 was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and is included as part of the record.\nThe transcript was received on October 2, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 47 years old. He has been employed by a business performing work on\nbehalf of the Government since November 2005. Applicant was previously employed in the\nprivate sector as a production control supervisor from February 1998 to July 1999; as a\nservice delivery manager from July 1999 to April 2003; as a self-employed insurance\nsalesman from July 2003 to March 2005; and as a sales clerk in a retail hardware store\nfrom July 2005 to November 2005. He was unemployed from March 2003 to July 2003,\nand from March 2005 to July 2005.\nApplicant was married in May 1997. He separated from his wife in February 2006,\ndue to her infidelity, and he obtained a divorce from her in April 2007. Applicant has two\nchildren from the marriage, ages ten and eight. Applicant had three step-children during\nthe marriage who are currently 18, 17 and 14 years old. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he lost his job in March 2003. He is a\nhigh school graduate who had managed to work himself into a position with that employer\nin which he was earning approximately $90,000 annually. When the company was sold,\nApplicant was not retained because the new owners of the company decided the person\nholding Applicant\u2019s position was required to have a college degree. Following several\nmonths of unemployment during which Applicant sought other employment, he decided to\nstart a business as an insurance salesman. That business endeavor was unsuccessful. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was responsible for handling the family finances during the\nmarriage. Shortly after he lost his job in 2003, Applicant discovered his wife was abusing\ncredit cards and had accumulated debt that he was unable to service. In March 2005,\nhaving concluded the insurance business was not going to work, Applicant moved his\nfamily to a different state, where he worked for his father for several months until he took\nthe job with a hardware store to obtain medical insurance coverage for his family.\nWhen Applicant separated from his wife in 2006, he began paying her $850 per\nmonth as support for her and their children. He reduced those payments to $183 on the\nadvice of his attorney and a mediator. When he appeared in court in April 2007, the\ncombined child support and alimony he was ordered to pay was raised to $950 and he was\n\n The SOR alleges the amount owed is $3,341. The actual amount owed is listed in AE 2 as $3,431.\n2\n3\nordered to pay a $6,000 arrearage. Additionally, he was required to pay $6,000 in\nattorney\u2019s fees. Applicant eventually cleared the arrearage charge by releasing his interest\nin a joint tax refund to his wife and turning over a vehicle to her. He is now current in his\nsupport payments. (Tr. p. 43)    \nThe collection accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.h, totaling $4,080, are\nbusiness loans Applicant acquired while trying to start an insurance business. They remain\nunpaid. The collection and charge off accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e,\n1.i, and 1.l are credit card and cellular phones bills, totaling $44,321, that Applicant\u2019s wife\nincurred before they were divorced. Applicant testified he and his wife were going to file a\njoint bankruptcy petition as part of the divorce to get rid of these debts but she eventually\ndecided she did not want to file for bankruptcy protection. (Tr. pp. 36-37) These debts\nremain unpaid.\nWhen Applicant lost his employment in 2003, he sold the house he had been living\nin and purchased a smaller home for his family. The collection account alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.f, owed in the amount of $3,431,  is for various items Applicant purchased\n2\nto make repairs on the home he purchased in 2003. The $102 collection account alleged\nin subparagraph 1.j is a cable television bill from Applicant\u2019s residence in the state from\nwhich he moved in 2005. These bills remain unpaid.\nApplicant testified the debts listed in subparagraphs 1.g, owed in the amount of\n$2,592, and 1.k, owed in the amount of $1,287, are paid off automobile loans. In response\nto interrogatories (GE 4), Applicant submitted proof of satisfied debts to the creditors\nnamed in those subparagraphs. However, a comparison of the account number listed in\nGE 4 with the account numbers listed in AE 2 and AE 3 for the debt alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.g discloses the debt alleged is actually a credit card debt that remains\nunpaid. The record does not contain sufficient evidence to determine the current status of\nthe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k. \nIn December 2001, Applicant purchased 6,425 shares of stock in a now defunct\ncompany at a total cost of $5,255.92. (AE 5) Company executives were convicted of\ncriminal offenses for their actions in defrauding investors and a lawsuit was filed on behalf\nof the investors. Applicant delayed seeking bankruptcy protection in the hope he would\nreceive sufficient proceeds from the lawsuit to satisfy his delinquent creditors. The lawsuit\nwas settled two weeks before the hearing in this case, with investors who were included\nin the settlement receiving on average $6.90 per share. (Tr. p. 39) Appellant was not\nincluded in the investors who were to receive a portion of the settlement. (Tr. p. 39)\nApplicant\u2019s credible testimony establishes he is currently living modestly and within\nhis financial means. He completed a credit counseling program on September 3, 2008. (AE\n4) With the assistance and advice of the credit counselors, he determined he lacks the\nfinancial assets to resolve his debts without seeking bankruptcy protection. He has now\n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n3\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n4\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n5\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n6\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n4\nretained an attorney to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on his behalf. The attorney\nreceived all the documentation required from Applicant to file a petition and anticipated\nhaving the petition filed by the end of October 2008. (AE 6) The attorney provided his legal\nopinion that Applicant would qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (AE 6)     \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n3\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.4\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n5\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.6\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.7\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n8\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n5\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n9\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant has numerous delinquent accounts, totalling $55,814, that have either\nbeen charged off or submitted for collection. Most, if not all of the alleged delinquent\naccounts remain unpaid. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began with his unexpected loss of well-paying\nemployment in 2003. They were greatly exacerbated by his wife\u2019s abuse of credit thereafter\nand the expenses he incurred in the resulting divorce. He quickly attempted to mitigate his\nfinancial problems by moving to a smaller house, starting an insurance business that failed,\nand then relocating to a different state where he was able to obtain immediate employment\nwith his father. Mitigating Condition MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances applies. \nApplicant acted reasonably in delaying seeking bankruptcy protection in the hope\nhe would obtain a portion of a lawsuit settlement that would allow him to satisfy his\ndelinquent creditors. He has completed a pre-bankruptcy filing credit counseling course,\nretained an attorney to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on his behalf, and supplied the\nlegal opinion of that attorney that he will qualify for Chapter 7 protection. MC 20(c): the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and 20(d): the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts apply. \nApplicant was living a financially responsible lifestyle when he unexpectedly lost his\nwell-paying job solely because his new employer deemed his education insufficient for the\nposition. He sold his house, used the proceeds to purchase a smaller home and live on\nuntil he could find new employment, and took reasonable steps to find replacement\n\n6\nemployment thereafter. He is now current in his support obligations and living within his\nfinancial means. (MC) 20(a): the behavior happened . . . under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment applies. \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. Although his substantial delinquent debts remain\noutstanding at the time of the issuance of this decision, I am satisfied based upon\nApplicant\u2019s appearance, demeanor, history, testimony, and the evidence he submitted that\nhe will continued to pursue Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and, based upon the legal\nopinion of his attorney, be successful in discharging his responsibility for all alleged debts\nin the very near future. \nApplicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of\npersuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant access to\nsensitive information. Guideline F is decided for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 30, 2007, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 19, 2008. Applicant received a\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on February 29, 2008, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nApril 28, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n1\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR, dated October 30, 2007).\n2\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated April 4, 2007).\n3\nId.\n4\nId.\n5\nItem 6 (Interrogatories from Applicant, dated October 2, 2007).\n6\nId.\n7\n2\nGovernment\u2019s case.

Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated October 30, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.I, 1.j, 1.l-1.p, 1.r-1.t, and 1.v-1.dd, of the\nSOR.   She denied the other factual allegations.\n2\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1982 and attended various college courses in 1998. She is currently\nseparated with four children. She has worked for her current employer since 2007.  \n3\nIn 1990, Applicant separated from her husband of nine years.  She accrued\n4\nmedical debts for her children. Although her husband had agreed to pay for the\nchildrens\u2019 medical needs, he did not do so.

She did not provide any information concerning\nperiods of unemployment or illness.\nApplicant was interviewed in May 2007 by Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigators. She stated the circumstances that led to all her debt was her\nseparation from her husband and her obligation to provide for her four children. She\nexplained that she and her husband did not have a legal separation, but he promised to\npay for certain things for the children. She also noted that prior to the separation she\nspent needlessly and unnecessarily.6\nApplicant admits she does not have the \u201cgreatest credit report.\u201d She states that\nher bills have not been paid over the years because she was raising her children. Now\nshe promises to get on track and pay her delinquent bills.  This has not occurred.  \n7\n\nItem 8 (Credit Bureau Report, dated October 11, 2007).\n8\nItem 5 (Letter, dated October 2, 2007).\n9\nItem 6 (Interview dated, dated May 2007).\n10\nApplicant\u2019s submission to FORM.\n11\n3\nThe SOR alleges 31 delinquent debts. The total amount of debt is approximately\n$28,741.  Applicant admits to debts totaling approximately $24,922. She submitted\n8\npaperwork showing that she has recently made payment arrangements for one student\nloan in the amount of $188 a month since October 2007. She provided five receipts.\nApplicant disputed several debts. She wrote a letter to a management company\nfor a 2007 judgment alleged in 1.ee ($1,739). She still disputes that the debt is hers\ndespite the fact that the company responded that it is her debt and is on her credit\nreport. Applicant also disputes the 2005 debt in 1.w ($538) because it belongs to her\nsister-in-law, but then admits the same debt in 1.w. Applicant\u2019s response, to the other\nadmitted allegations in the SOR, is that she \u201chopes\u201d to have the debts paid off by the\nend of the year. She also asserted that she will set up a budget and start to pay off the\nsmaller debts first. She promised to see a credit advisory company to help her.9\nApplicant has two student loans in the amount of $15,000. She admitted to the\ndelinquent debt in her answer and stated in her security clearance application that her\nfederal income tax return is intercepted each year to pay part of the loan. Her most\nrecent credit report (2007) shows that the student loans are in collection (default status).\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is $1,758. Her total monthly expenses were\n$1,552. Her net remainder was approximately $206.   These figures were current as of\n10\nMay 2007. Applicant did not provide any updated information on her income in response\nto the FORM. \nApplicant\u2019s current employer recommends her as an asset to any organization.\nHe attests to her professional demeanor and dedication to excellence.11\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\n4\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19\u00a9, Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts and was unable to pay her\nobligations for a long period of time. Her credit reports confirm that she has not paid the\ncharged off collection accounts and judgments. She admits approximately $29,130 in\ndelinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nmajor financial worries arose after her separation from her husband. From 2000 until\n2007, she has had accounts referred for collection and an unresolved judgment. This\npotentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s reliance on\nher marital separation for her financial difficulties is not sufficient mitigation in this case.\nThey separated in 1990 and Applicant has since incurred substantial student loan debt\nand other accounts since that time. She had medical bills for her children, but she did\nnot act responsibly in resolving her delinquent debts. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition does not fully apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has only recently (2007) promised to contact a\ncounseling firm. She still has not developed a repayment plan for all her debts. There is\ninsufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of\nher debt. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant disputed some\ndelinquent debts but she has no documentation to substantiate any resolution. I\nconclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\n adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has worked for many\nyears and has provided for her four children. She and her husband separated in April\n1990. She explained that he has not kept his promise to help with the medical needs of\nthe children. Thus, Applicant has delinquent medical bills. However, she also has\ncollection accounts for more than 25 debts and has not pursued a payment plan. As to\nher student loans, she recently provided documentation that in October 2007, she\nbegan to pay on one of her student loans. She has made five payments. These\ncircumstances beyond her control exacerbated her difficulties but she did not act\nreasonably. Failure to pay debts is not prudent or responsible. She has been on notice\nsince October 2007 that her security clearance was under investigation. She did state at\nthat time that she would start a repayment plan. She did not follow through. She did not\nenroll in a debt resolution plan for the debts. Even an applicant with a good employment\nrecord could have security concerns that raise doubts about her good judgment. She\nhas not met her burden of proof in this case to overcome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-ee:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s failure to mitigate the\nGuideline E, D and J security concerns is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings: In 2006, Applicant was removed from\nan assigned project and his employment was terminated following an investigation by the U.S.\nDepartment of the Navy which determined that Applicant had committed Sexual Battery on a fellow\nemployee.  Applicant testified that he had lied about the incident to a Naval investigator, and\nexecuted a false statement to that effect, because he was afraid that he would lose his job and his\ncoworkers would think he was a homosexual.  He did not admit to the incident until he was in the\nprocess of undergoing a polygraph examination.\nApplicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) in September 2006.  Question\n22 of the application asked whether during the last seven years, Applicant had ever been terminated\nfrom a job, or lost his job under other than favorable circumstances.  Applicant replied \u201cNo\u201d to that\nquestion.  Applicant later submitted a second version of the SCA, in which he corrected his answer\nto question 22, to show that he had lost his job under less than favorable conditions.  However, he\ndid not attempt to make that correction until after he had revealed the truth about the incident during\nthe polygraph examination process.

The Government offered Exhibits (Ex) 1 through 5, which were\nreceived and admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A\n\n2\nthrough C. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on March 14, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., and 2.a., and he\ndenied 1.c., and 3.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is married, and he has two children. He served in\nthe United States Navy for 22 years. \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he furnished untruthful information to the Government and engaged\nin conduct that exhibited poor judgement and untrustworthiness.  \n     1.a. Applicant was removed from his assigned project in July 2006, and his\nemployment was ultimately terminated in August 2006 following an investigation by the\nU.S. Department of the Navy wherein it was concluded that Applicant committed Sexual\nBattery by the unsolicited touching of the genitals of a fellow employee, while both were\nin the shower. \nApplicant testified that this incident occurred, when he was going to pretend to\ngrab this fellow worker\u2019s genitals as a joke in the hopes that the person would move\naway from Applicant, but he claimed that he accidentally did grab him, and also bumped\nhis shoulder. Applicant conceded that he did not personally know this fellow worker, nor\nhad he ever even spoken to him before. His only explanation for his conduct was that\nthis other man was often looking at him, especially when they were in the locker room.\nApplicant claimed he tried to apologize to the man, but he was unable to do so. This\ncoworker filed a grievance against Applicant (Tr at 35-40). \n1.b. Applicant completed a signed statement, dated August 2, 2006, (Exhibit 2)\nwhich was presented to an investigator of the U.S. Navy Criminal Investigation Division,\nin which Applicant denied that he ever engaged in the touching of a fellow employee, as\ndescribed in 1.a., above.\n\n3\nApplicant testified that he lied to the Naval investigator, and completed the false\nstatement, because he was afraid that he would lose his job, and he was afraid his\ncoworkers would think he was a homosexual.  Applicant ultimately revealed that the\nincident did occur as he was in the process of receiving a polygraph examination. At the\nhearing he conceded that he had never been forthcoming about the incident, until he\nwas actually undergoing the polygraph examination. \n1.c. Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) which he\nexecuted on September 5, 2006 (Exhibit 1). Question #22 of the SCA asked whether\nduring the last seven years, Applicant had ever been terminated from a job, or lost his\njob under other than favorable circumstances. Applicant replied \u201cNo\u201d to that question.\nThe Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s was not truthful and he should have included\nhis termination, as discussed in 1. a., above. \nApplicant submitted a second version of the SCA (Exhibit A), in which he had\ncorrected his answer to question #22, to show that he had lost his job under less than\nfavorable conditions.  However, Applicant conceded that he did not attempt to make this\ncorrection until after he had revealed the truth of the incident, during the time that he\nwas receiving the polygraph examination. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline D - Sexual Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that is either criminal, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgement or discretion, or which may\nsubject an individual to undue influence or coercion.  \n2.a. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 1, subparagraph a.,\nconstitutes the kind of sexual behavior that is of concern to the Government, as it is\ncriminal conduct, and it exhibits a lack of discretion and good judgement.   \nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct. \n2.a. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 1, subparagraphs b. and\nc., constitutes a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001,\nwhich is a felony.\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted two letters of reference that were extremely laudatory of\nApplicant\u2019s character and reliability  (Exhibit B ).\n \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government incomplete, untruthful answers in a statement signed by Applicant on\nAugust 2, 2006, and on a SCA that he executed on September 5, 2006. \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that\nDC 16. (a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, and\nfalsification of relevant facts from a personnel security questionnaire, which was used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility. DC (b) also applies since Applicant deliberately\nprovided false relevant information to the Navy investigator. Since Applicant only\nrevealed that the incident took place after he began the process of undergoing a\npolygraph examination, I can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies in this\nparagraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 1, Guideline E, against Applicant.\nGuideline D, Sexual Conduct\nThe Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant\nengaged in the kind of sexual behavior that is of concern to the Government, as it is\ncriminal conduct, and it exhibits a lack of discretion and good judgement.  \nDC 13. (a), sexual behavior that is of criminal nature, whether or not the\nindividual has been prosecuted, applies to the facts of this case. DC (d) also applies\nbecause Applicant engaged in sexual behavior that reflects lack of discretion or\njudgement.  No MC can be found to apply here.  Paragraph 2, Guideline D is found\nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant\nengaged in criminal conduct, by his knowingly providing false and misleading\ninformation to the Government investigator and on a  security questionnaire, which is a\nfelony.\n\n6\nDC 31. (a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this\ncase. DC 31. (c), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, is also applicable to this case. There is no MC under\nCriminal Conduct. Paragraph 3, Guideline J is found against Applicant\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove, regarding Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct and his lack of candor, I find that the\nrecord evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 43 years old, married, and did not graduate from high school, but has completed some college courses. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Warehouse Specialist, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct. The Applicant was arrested, charged and convicted on twelve separate occasions, beginning in 1983 and continuing until at least September 2000, for various criminal violations, nine of which were drug related offenses. He attributes his high risk lifestyle to the fact that he grew up a troubled youth in a rough, poverty stricken neighborhood where drugs and criminal conduct ran rampant. He was in and out of foster care and eventually ended up living on the streets. In May 1983, he was arrested and charged with Simple Battery. The Applicant got into a fight with a known criminal who hit him with a stick. The Applicant hit him back, while the police were watching the incident. At court, the case was dismissed. In January 1985, he was arrested for Burglary. This case was also dismissed. In January 1988, on the Applicant\u2019s birthday, he was arrested and charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance (Cocaine). This charge was later dismissed.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 20, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated January\n15, 2007.  On March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 17, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 7, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 6, 2008.  A notice\nof hearing was issued on June 16, 2008, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on\nJuly 8, 2008.  The Government called one witness and presented five exhibits, referred\nto as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. The\nApplicant presented three exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C,\nwhich were received without objection. The Applicant also testified on his own behalf.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 18, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43 years old, married, and did not graduate from high school,\nbut has completed some college courses.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nWarehouse Specialist, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant was arrested, charged and convicted on twelve separate\noccasions, beginning in 1983 and continuing until at least September 2000, for various\ncriminal violations, nine of which were drug related offenses.  He attributes his high risk\nlifestyle to the fact that he grew up a troubled youth in a rough, poverty stricken\nneighborhood where drugs and criminal conduct ran rampant.  He was in and out of\nfoster care and eventually ended up living on the streets.    \n \nIn May 1983, he was arrested and charged with Simple Battery.  The Applicant\ngot into a fight with a known criminal who hit him with a stick.  The Applicant hit him\nback, while the police were watching the incident.  At court, the case was dismissed.  In\nJanuary 1985, he was arrested for Burglary.  This case was also dismissed.  In January\n1988, on the Applicant\u2019s birthday, he was arrested and charged with Possession of a\nControlled Substance (Cocaine).  This charge was later dismissed.  Three days later, in\nJanuary 1988, the Applicant was arrested for Possession of a Controlled Substance,\nUnlawful Use of a Weapon and Failure to Register a Firearm.  In June 1988, he was\narrested and charged with Possession of Cocaine.  In July 1988, he was arrested again\nand charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance.  In February 1990, he was\narrested and charged with Carrying a Concealed Weapon.  He pled guilty and was\nsentenced to one year of supervised probation.  In August 1990, he was arrested and\ncharged with Possession of a Controlled Substance with Intent to Deliver.  In October\n1990, he was arrested and charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance.\n(Government Exhibit 3)   \nIn July 1991, he was charged with Unlawful Use of a Weapon, Failure to Register\na Weapon, and Possession of a Controlled Substance.  The Applicant pled guilty and\nwas sentenced to 14 days in jail and one year of probation.  (Government Exhibit 3).\nIn April 1992, he was charged with Possession of Heroin.  The charge was later\ndismissed.  (Government Exhibit 3).\nIn September 2000, he was arrested and charged with Possession of a\nControlled Substance (Marijuana/Cocaine).  The Applicant explained that he was off\nwork and was sitting in his car \u201cgetting high\u201d.  He was smoking a marijuana cigarette\nlaced with cocaine when the police pulled up and caught him in the act.  He was later\nenrolled in a diversion program for drug abuse and education which he completed in\nJuly 2001.  (Government Exhibit 3).      \n\n3\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant used a variety of illegal drugs beginning in 1979 at the age of\nfourteen or fifteen, that continued until at least October 2000, at the age thirty-five.\n \nIn 1979, while in high school, he started using marijuana and used it on almost a\ndaily basis.  As time passed and as he got older, he often smoked marijuana cigarettes\nthat were laced with cocaine or PCP.  He usually smoked it when he got together with\nfriends.  He also snorted heroin and cocaine.  Although some of his illegal drugs were\nprovided by friends, he also purchased them with money he earned from odd jobs,\nspending between $30.00 and $40.00 a week on the drugs.  He has not used heroin or\ncocaine since 1990.  \nDuring his childhood, he described his home life as \u201cmessed up\u201d.  His mother\nwas an alcoholic, his father was not around.  He was one of seven children in his family\nand was placed into a foster home at ten years of age.  When he returned home, they\nlived among rats and poverty.  He and his siblings missed lots of school because they\nhad no clothes or shoes to wear.  He found himself rebelling against everything and his\nway of rebelling was to use drugs.  \nAfter his arrest in 2000, in an attempt to straighten out his life and stop using\nillegal drugs, the Applicant moved his family out of state and across the country.  He\nhas not used any illegal drug since he got out of jail following his arrest in September\n2000.  In July 2001, he completed the court ordered drug diversion program.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  He indicates that he found the diversion program to be very\nhelpful.  His wife has also helped him to stay drug free by keeping track of him and\nmaking sure that he is staying on the straight and narrow.  He no longer associates with\ndrug users and only surrounds himself with positive people.  His main focus is to take\ncare of his family.  He also coaches basketball for the local park and recreation center\nand attends church.      \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application dated January 15,\n2007.  Question 23(a) of the application asked the Applicant if he has ever been\ncharged with or convicted of a felony?  The  Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 1).  The record is not clear as to whether any of the charges set\nforth under paragraph 1 above are felonies.  Accordingly, this allegation is found for the\nApplicant.          \n  \nQuestion 23(b) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if he has ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense?  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNo\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant\nfailed to list his firearms charges set forth above under paragraph 1.   \n\n4\nQuestion 23(c) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if he has ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs?  The\nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The\nApplicant failed to list his drug-related charges set forth above under paragraph 1.  \nQuestion 24(a) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if since the age of\n16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, he illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium,\nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc), \namphetamines, \ndepressants \nbarbiturates,\nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc), hallucinogens, (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription\ndrugs?\u201d, The Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false\nanswer.  He failed to disclose his illegal use of drugs in September 2000, when he was\narrested for possession of marijuana and cocaine.  \nThe Applicant offered a number of excuses as to why he did not answer the\nquestions truthfully.  He explained that he thought that the questions only asked him for\nmatters that may have occurred within the last seven years.  (Tr. p. 60).  He stated that\nhe conducted a criminal record search and did not come up with anything so he did not\nreveal his past. He indicated that he did not have specific dates and that is why he did\nnot disclose his arrests.  (Tr. p. 64).  He stated that he knew that he was going to have\nan interview with an investigator and that he would reveal the truth then.  (Tr. p. 65).\nWith regard to question 23(c), concerning whether he had ever used any illegal drugs,\nhe acknowledges that he should have answered, \u201cYES\u201d.  He does not know why he did\nnot answer the question truthfully.  (Tr. p. 61)\nBased upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified\nhis Security Clearance Application dated January 15, 2007.  The Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nfalsifications in his security clearance application, are violations of Title 18 of the United\nStates Code, Section 1001, a felony.\n \nParagraph 4 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant was indebted to a County for delinquent child support in the\namount of $17,044.79.  As of January 15, 2007, this debt had not been paid.  The\nApplicant settled this agreement with the County Child Support Services Department\nand entered into an agreement with the mother of his child to pay her $450.00 monthly\nwhich he has been doing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s coworkers and friends attest to\nthe fact that the Applicant is a valuable asset to the company.  He is considered to be a\nhard working, enthusiastic, honest, responsible and trustworthy.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\n\n5\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24.  The Concern.  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\n\n6\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(d)  the person initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n7\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct, drug abuse, dishonesty and financial\nproblems that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n8\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J), drug involvement (Guideline\nH), dishonesty (Guideline E), and financial irresponsibility (Guideline F).  The totality of\nthis evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines J and E of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  The Applicant has a twenty year history of criminal conduct that\nincludes twelve arrests.  Although his most recent arrest occurred in 2000, almost eight\nyears ago, he has recently lied a number of times in response to different questions\nabout his criminal record on his Security Clearance Application.  By doing so, he\ncommitted violations of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.  This will be\ndiscussed further under Guideline E, below.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, disqualifying conditions, 25.(a) any drug\nabuse, 25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 22.(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  However, mitigating condition\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment also applies.  Applicant\u2019s last use of\nany illegal drug, be it marijuana, PCP, heroin or cocaine, last occurred in 2000, eight\nyears ago.  His last use of illegal drugs occurred far in the distant past and there is no\nevidence in the record to indicate otherwise.  He has made drastic changes in his life to\nimprove it and I do not find his past use of illegal drugs to be recent or of security\nsignificance.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \n   \nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct is very troubling.  He\nhas not been honest with the Government in answering questions about his arrest\nhistory and his most recent illegal drug involvement.  He deliberately tried to conceal the\ntruth.  So much inconsistency confirms to the Government that the Applicant\u2019s credibility\nis a security concern.  There is no reasonable excuse as to why he did not tell the truth\nabout his criminal history, other than the fact that he wanted to minimize it.  It is obvious\nthat he intentionally concealed this information from the Government, hoping to\nminimize the seriousness of the matter.  Consequently, his dishonesty with the\nGovernment concerning this matter is unacceptable.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\n\n9\nresponsibilities applies.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty\nof clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an\nApplicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his\npersonal background.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under\nGuidelines E or J apply. \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant fell behind on his child support payments\nbut that he has settled the matter with the County Child Support Services Department\nand he has negotiated with the mother of his child to pay her $450.00 a month to satisfy\nthis requirement.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19.(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations are applicable.  Mitigating Condition 20.(d) the person\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also\napplies.  His financial problems have been resolved.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.     \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the SOR.  Paragraphs 2 and 4 are\nfound for the Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n10\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n Paragraph 4: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  4.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 5, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on April 8, 2008. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 18, 2008, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on May 29, 2008. The record closed on June 13, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 11, 2008.  \nJune 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to India. Applicant did not object and the request was approved. \nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as HE I through XIV. The facts administratively noticed are set \nout in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one witness, and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A and B, which were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until June 13, 2008, to submit additional matters. \nApplicant submitted 41 pages of documents marked as AE C through J. AE C, and E \nthrough J were admitted without objection. Department Counsel objected to AE D, a \nletter by Applicant dated June 12, 2008, on the basis that the letter contained additional \ninformation that was testimonial in nature. The objection to AE D is overruled and it is \nadmitted. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is HE XV.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in the \nUnited States. He is a college graduate from an Indian university. He is single with no \nchildren.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of India. His maternal grandfather \nimmigrated to the United States and became a U.S. citizen. His parents were visiting his \ngrandfather in the U.S. when Applicant was born prematurely. They returned with him to \nIndia when he was very young. He attended school in India. It was his intent from an \nearly age to eventually return to America to live. He returned to the United States in July \n2005, after he graduated from college.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother does not work outside the home. He contacts his mother by e-\nmail about once a week. He also speaks with her periodically on the telephone. \nApplicant has not returned to India since he left in 2005. He saw his mother in 2006, \nwhen she came to the United States for a family member\u2019s wedding. His father works \nfor an Indian government agency. He is the head of a department. Applicant is not \ntotally certain what his father does, but he believes it has to do with checking machinery \nand equipment. He believes his father has about 12 people working under him. His \nfather served many years in the Indian military and retired as a senior officer. He \nreceives a government pension based upon his military service. He is in his late 50s \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 34-35, 52; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 35-39, 42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n\n \n3 \n \nand will retire when he turns 60. Applicant had limited contact with his father while he \nwas growing up because his father was stationed in an area that was distant from \nwhere Applicant and the rest of the family lived. He is much closer to his mother than \nhis father. His father has never visited him in the United States. His contact with his \nfather is mostly limited to when Applicant is contacting his mother.3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother is also a citizen and resident of India. He is in college \npursuing a master\u2019s degree. Applicant has very limited contact with his brother. He has \nnot seen his brother since he left India in 2005. The last time he spoke to him was about \nsix months ago, to wish him a happy birthday. Applicant would eventually like to \nsponsor his parents and brother to immigrate to the U.S. He does not provide any \nfinancial support to his family in India.4  \n \n \nApplicant lived with his grandfather when he came to the U.S. He currently rents \nan apartment as his grandfather has a full house. He plans on moving back in his \ngrandfather\u2019s house next year after another family member moves out. He is involved in \nhis community. He is a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) for his local fire \nand rescue department. He has volunteered 350 hours in the last seven months. He \nhas no foreign assets. He is saving for the future and to be financially capable of \nsponsoring his family. He has assets of about $65,000 to $70,000 in the United States.5 \n \n \nAlmost all of Applicant\u2019s family on his mother\u2019s side are in the U.S. His maternal \ngrandparents, two uncles, and an aunt are all U.S. citizens and residents. He also has \nnumerous cousins that are U.S. citizens. They all live in the same geographic location \nas Applicant, except for one cousin who lives in another state. His grandfather was born \nin India. He started working for the U.S. Government as a young man. He spent more \nthan 40 years working for the U.S. Government, in India, in the United States, and in \nother foreign countries. His son, Applicant\u2019s uncle, has worked for the U.S. Government \nfor more than 20 years.6 \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s supervisors wrote character letters on his behalf. Both \nindividuals have decades of experience in the military, as defense contractors, and hold \nclearances. Applicant is described as \u201ca proud, patriotic citizen who is unequivocal in his \nsupport of our nation.\u201d He has displayed integrity and is trustworthy, dedicated, and \nconscientious. They recommend him for a security clearance. His grandfather testified \nthat Applicant is a loyal U.S. citizen, who is stable and truthful, and would \u201cnot lie under \nany circumstances.\u201d7 \n                                                          \n \n3 Tr. at 53-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 70-76, 86-87; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 43-44, 82-85, 96. \n \n6 Tr. at 87-89; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n7 Tr. at 99-100; AE A, B. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIndia \n \n \nAccording to its constitution, India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic \nrepublic. It is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament \nand a population of approximately 1.1 billion.  \n \nThe Indian government generally respects the rights of its citizens, but numerous \nserious problems remain. Police and security forces have engaged in extrajudicial \nkillings of persons in custody, disappearances, torture, and rape. The lack of \naccountability permeated the government and security forces, creating an atmosphere \nin which human rights violations went unpunished. A number of violent attacks have \nbeen committed in recent years by separatist and terrorist groups. \n \nThe U.S. recognizes India as key to strategic interests and has sought to \nstrengthen its relationship with India. The two countries are the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracies, both committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment, and share common interests in the free flow of commerce, in fighting \nterrorism, and in creating a strategically stable Asia. However, differences over India\u2019s \nnuclear weapons program and pace of economic reform exist. There are also concerns \nabout India\u2019s relations with Iran, including their increasing cooperation with the Iranian \nmilitary. \n \nThere have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India, including technology and equipment which \nwere determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Foreign \ngovernment entities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have \ncapitalized on private-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive \nU.S. technology by foreign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments \nor its use in military applications. \n \nThe U.S. views India as a growing world power with which it shares common \nstrategic interests. There is a strong partnership between the two countries and they are \nexpected to continue to address differences and shape a dynamic and collaborative \nfuture. The U.S. and India are seeking to elevate the strategic partnership further to \ninclude cooperation in counter-terrorism, defense cooperation, education, and joint \ndemocracy promotion. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \n\n \n6 \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and brother are citizens and residents of India. His father \nworks for an Indian government agency. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy, works \nclosely with the U.S. on many matters, shares common strategic interests, and \ngenerally respects the rights of its citizens. But it also continues to have some human \nrights issues, has been victimized by terrorist attacks, and restricted, dual use \ntechnology has been illegally exported to India. This creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential \nconflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant was born in the United States, but was raised in India. He came to the \nU.S. in 2005, after he graduated from college. He obtained a good job, where he is \nrespected and highly regarded. He lived with his grandfather, who is a U.S. citizen and \nhas worked for the U.S. Government for decades. He is obviously very close to his \ngrandfather and greatly admires him. Virtually all of his mother\u2019s side of the family are \nU.S. citizens and residents. His parents and brother are still in India and his father \nworks for the Indian government. India is a democracy and strategic partner of the \nUnited States. Technology has been illegally exported to India, but the Hearing Exhibits \nprovided by Counsel do not show that coercion was utilized. I find that it is not likely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nIndian government or his family members in India and the interests of the United States. \nI further find there is minimal conflict of interest, because Applicant can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \npartially applicable. No other mitigating condition is applicable. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an American citizen by \nbirth. While he was raised in India, it is clear that the United States was always where \nhe wanted to be. He returned to the U.S. in 2005, after he graduated from college. He is \nvery highly regarded at work. He is committed to his community, volunteering many \nhours as an EMT. He diligently saved to be financially secure and to be able to sponsor \nhis parents and brother to immigrate to the United States. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to India. There is a strong \npartnership between the U.S. and India and they share common strategic interests. \nHowever, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d8 The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly \ngovernments must be made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, \nsometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged \nin espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with \nthe U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. Also very \nimportant is whether the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \nIndia is a democracy that generally respects the rights of its citizens, but \nnumerous serious problems remain. Like almost every country, including the United \nStates, it has been victimized by terrorist acts. Restricted, dual use technology has been \nillegally exported to India, but there is no indication that India utilizes coercion against its \ncitizens for espionage purposes. Many of our allies conduct intelligence gathering \nagainst the U.S. India would be jeopardizing its relationship with the U.S. by raising the \nstakes, and attempting to use duress against one of its citizens in an attempt to coerce \na U.S. citizen to commit espionage. Applicant\u2019s position, assets, and ties in the U.S. \nmake economic coercion through his parents and brother extremely unlikely to happen. \nIn the very unlikely event that a conflict arose, I am convinced that because of \nApplicant\u2019s strong ties to the United States, that he would resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. \n \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n \n9 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

No evidence has been introduced to\nestablish if this debt is now deferred or what the current status of this debt.  \nApplicant\u2019s primary explanation for her overdue debts is her husband\u2019s history of\nsporadic employment. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. Applicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P)\n(Item 5), on March 8,  2006. Question 22.b. asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question,\nand she listed no debts. The Government alleges that Applicant should have included\nthe debts listed in the SOR under paragraph 1. \nClearly these debts had been delinquent for more than 180 days when Applicant\ncompleted and executed the (SF 85P), and they should have been listed in response to\nquestion 22.b. In her RSOR, Applicant acknowledged that her answer was incorrect, but\nclaimed that she did not realize that she was required to list all of her delinquent debts\n(Item 4).  \n2.b. In October 2004, Applicant\u2019s was terminated from her position as a Patient\nAccess Representative at a medical college for failure to follow rules. \n2.c. During a period from December 2002 through February 2007, Applicant\nwrote nine checks that were returned by her bank for insufficient funds. Applicant never\nrepaid the creditors for these \u201cbad\u2019 checks. \n\n6\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe SOR lists 5 allegations, regarding criminal conduct under Adjudicative\nGuideline J. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\n3.a. On March 22, 2001,  Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving with a\nLicense Suspended or Revoked. She plead nolo Contendere and was sentenced to 12\nmonths probation and ordered to pay a fine of $625.\n3.b. On September 30, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with Failing to\nAppear. As a result, she paid a fine of $913.\n3.c.  On May 18, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with a Probation\nViolation. Applicant was ordered to pay a fine of $285.\n \n3.d. On October 6, 2004, Applicant was arrested charged with Theft by Taking, a\nfelon. This charge was later nolle presequi.\n3.e.  It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant\u2019s continued conduct, described in\nparagraph 2.c., above, are considered misdemeanor offenses under Georgia Code\nSection 16-9-20.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n7\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F- Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC 19. (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to satisfy\nher debts, and her long history of not meeting her financial obligations.\nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies. While MC 20.(b) could\ninitially be argued to apply since some of Applicants financial problems were as a result\nof the employment difficulties of her husband, it has not been established that Applicant\nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances, since she has failed to resolve any of\nher overdue debts, even those debts for which a minimal amount is owing, and she has\nfailed to seek any financial counseling which could help to resolve financial difficulties\nnow and in the future. While she has now filed for bankruptcy, there is no indication that\nher debts will be discharged, and even if they are ultimately discharged, there is no\nindication that she will not have financial difficulties in the future.  I, therefore, hold\nGuideline F against Applicant.\n\n8\nGuideline E- Personal Conduct\n       With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SF 85P that she executed on\nMarch 8,  2006.  Applicant identified no debts that were over 180 days overdue in the\nlast seven years prior to her completing the SF 85P, when clearly she should have\nidentified the debts listed on the SOR. I find that Applicant\u2019s explanation that it was\nsimply a mistake, as the reason for her failure to put the Government on notice that she\nhad financial difficulties, is not sufficient or credible to consider it as mitigation.\n      \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to the Government, it is extremely difficult to\nconclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an\nindividual given a clearance. In this case, based on Applicant\u2019s overall history, my\ninability to see the Applicant and judge her veracity in person, and the lack of any\nwitness to provide testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s character, I can find no reasonable\nexplanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to provide this very significant information to the\nGovernment on the SF 85P, and I must conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly\nfailed to give complete, honest information to the Government. \nHer writing of nine insufficient checks over the course of several years, and her\nfailure to resolve these debts, also shows questionable judgement dishonestly and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that DC16. (a) applies\nbecause Applicant deliberately provided false and misleading information to the\nGovernment in her SF 85P.   DC16. (d) also applies because Applicant\u2019s issuance of\nbad checks shows a pattern of dishonesty.  No Mitigating Condition applies under this\nGuideline.  As a result of the misinformation that Applicant  provided to the Government,\nand her issuance of bad checks, her conduct exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged\nin criminal conduct, as she was arrested for, and convicted of criminal offenses from\n2001 to 2004, and issued checks with insufficient funds from 2002 to 2007.  \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation\nConditions (MC), I can not find that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is no\nevidence of successful rehabilitation , nor have I seen any evidence of sincere remorse.\nApplicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \n \n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F, E, and J, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, her failure to resolve the overdue debts, even the very small ones,  her willful\nomissions made to the Government, and her criminal conduct, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a sensitive position, under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through af:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJuly 28, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 17, 2006.\n(Government Exhibit 1.)  On January 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines E and J concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on January 28, 2008.  Pursuant to\nParagraph E3.1.8 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, the Department Counsel requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non March 14, 2008.  I received the case assignment on March 20, 2008.  DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on April 14, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May\n\n2\n5, 2008. The Government called one witness and offered Government Exhibits 1\nthrough 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing on May 15, 2008.  The record closed on that date. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 30 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has failed to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nclearance screening process.\nThe Applicant was involved in a serious crime on October 1, 2005.  On that date,\nthe Applicant was attending a wedding rehearsal party with several relatives.  This party\nwent on for several hours and the Applicant became intoxicated.  Early in the morning,\nthe Applicant, and two other members of the wedding party, beat up a man who had\nbeen involved in an earlier incident with the family.  The victim was seriously injured\nduring the beating.  (Government Exhibit 2 at pages 3-4, and Government Exhibits 4\nand 5; Transcript at 44-45.)\nThe Applicant was subsequently arrested by the police and charged with Battery\nwith Substantial Bodily Harm, a felony.  On November 13, 2006, he plead guilty and\nwas sentenced to four years probation with conditions requiring he attend various types\nof counseling, to pay court fees of $300 and to pay restitution to the victim of\n$15,744.34.  He is currently on probation until November 2010.  At the end of two years,\nwhich will occur in November 2008, the Applicant can petition to have his probation\nended early because he has paid the restitution and completed all of the required\ncounseling.  (Transcript at 50.)\nAt the time of the incident the Applicant was extremely intoxicated and does not\nhave any clear memory of the fight.  In May 2007 he was interviewed by an investigator\nfor the Department of Defense.  In that interview, based on his knowledge at the time,\nthe Applicant stated that he struck the victim twice while the victim was trying to get up.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 3-4.)  In fact, as a surveillance video shows, the victim was\nunconscious and the Applicant hit him several times in the face.  The Applicant has\n\n3\nseen the video, confirmed what really happened, and is deeply regretful both for his\nconduct and for his unintentional misleading of the Defense Department.  The police\nreport says that the Applicant hit the victim with a bottle, but the Applicant cannot\nconfirm that fact based on the video.  (Transcript at 45-47, 57-59.)\nIn addition to the felony conviction, the Applicant had a minor confrontation which\ninvolved the police while he was in the Army in the early 1990s.  (Transcript at 40-42.)\nIn addition, the Applicant admits that, \u201cMy weakness is my family.  I love my family, and\nanytime anything happens to them, it bothers me.  It hurts me, and they [Anger\nManagement Class] help me deal with that.\u201d  (Transcript at 53.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 7-20, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\nHis former supervisor states, \u201c[The Applicant] performed his duties far above and\nbeyond the standard.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 2 at 17.)  (See Government Exhibit 2 at 10,\n14, 15, 17, 18 and 19.)\nSeveral of the letters are from his relatives, including his wife.  They show that\nthe Applicant is a beloved husband and father.  (See Government Exhibit 2 at 7, 8, 9,\n11, 12, 13 and 16.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in a major criminal incident in 2005, which resulted in\nthe victim being seriously injured.  By his own admission, and as reflected by his guilty\nplea to felony Battery with Substantial Bodily Harm, the Applicant was a prime mover in\nthis act.  AG \u00b6 31(a) applies to this case, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca\nsingle serious crime of multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31(d) states that it can be disqualifying if the \u201cindividual is currently on\nparole or probation.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s probation is not due to expire until November\n\n5\n2010 and he cannot petition for early release until November 2008.  This disqualifying\ncondition also applies to this case.\nTwo of the mitigating conditions also may apply and have been considered.\nThey are AG \u00b6 32(a ), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG\n\u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d \nThis is a close case.  The Applicant is a sympathetic young man, who made a\nvery serious mistake.  He is regretful and remorseful over his conduct.  However, it has\nnot yet been three years since the incident and he has only been on probation less than\ntwo years.  In addition, there is some evidence that this is not an isolated incident and\nthat the Applicant has anger management issues.  Under the particular circumstances\nof this case, at this point in time, using the clearly consistent standard, I must find this\nallegation against the Applicant.   \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nI have examined the record and I find that the Applicant did not intentionally\nfalsify material facts during an interview with a Department of Defense investigator in\nMay 2007.  The Applicant freely admits that he was seriously intoxicated on the night of\nthe incident and has little direct knowledge of the event.  Only after receiving a copy of\nthe surveillance video was the Applicant able to fully understand what happened on that\nevening.  Since his conduct was not intentional, none of the disqualifying conditions\napply.  Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\n\n6\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, professional person who is attempting to overcome his earlier criminal\nconviction. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the conduct occurred recently, in 2005.  He has been on\nprobation less than two years.  He has taken several classes in Anger Management and\nother issues.  However, given the relatively short time since the event, I cannot find that\nthere have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the\npresent time, I cannot find that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct.  The Applicant has come a long way.  As stated earlier, this is a close case.\nHe may well be eligible for a clearance in the future.  He is not now.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  As\nstated above, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The record also included a Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated December 31, \n1999 (GE 1). \n \nOctober 23, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 12 and August 18, 2008, and initially \nrequested to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. After \nreceipt of the file of relevant material, she requested a hearing before an Administrative \nJudge (Tr. 15). The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on September 12, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled on \nSeptember 29, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, \nwhich were admitted without objection (Tr. 38). Applicant testified on her own behalf, \nand presented one witness and Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October \n7, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all 24 financial allegations under SOR \u00b6 1. She denied the two \npersonal conduct allegations under SOR \u00b6 2. Her admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old administrative assistant working for a Government \ncontractor. She completed high school in 1988, and started working for Government \ncontractors shortly thereafter. In 1990, she received access to classified information at \nthe top secret level (Tr. 5-6). She has been continuously employed since 1990 (Tr. 68-\n70). She has renewed her security clearance every four years, and has maintained her \ntop secret access up to her hearing date. She has never been married. She has one \nson, age four. Applicant has custody of her son and receives no financial support from \nhis father.  \n \n \nIn her December 1999 security clearance application (GE 1), Applicant disclosed \nshe filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 1999 in the amount of \n$151,680. She also disclosed that she had been over 180 days delinquent on 12 \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n                                                          \ndifferent debts, but indicated the debts were \u201csettled\u201d in bankruptcy court (GE 1). In \nFebruary 2000, the bankruptcy court discharged Applicant of her debts.  \n \nThere is no evidence to show that she has compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. Nor is there evidence showing that she has ever \nfailed to follow the rules and procedures required to handle classified information. She \nhas no police record, and there is no evidence she has used or trafficked in illegal \ndrugs. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her December 1999 and March 2006 SF 86s; her responses to \nDOHA interrogatories (GE 8); four credit bureau reports (CBRs) (GEs 4 - 7), and her \nOctober 2000 sworn statement (GE 2).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$39,000, which Applicant accumulated after her 2000 bankruptcy discharge. Applicant \nadmitted all the debts alleged in SOR are her debts and have been delinquent for a long \nperiod of time. Applicant explained that her financial problems were caused by a \ncombination of factors; i.e., a bad 12-year-old relationship, and she being a single \nmother and sole provider for her son (Tr. 43-44).  \n \nShe testified she had to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1999, because \nshe was living with a man who had a serious drug problem and was stealing money \nfrom her (Tr. 45-46).3 She was in that bad relationship for 12 years, and separated from \nher living-in boyfriend in 2003 (Tr. 46). Her son was born in 2004. His father is not the \nliving-in boyfriend. She receives no financial support from her son\u2019s father. Her financial \nproblems have continued after her 2000 bankruptcy discharge to her hearing day.  \n \nThe largest of her delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6 1.v) was for a 1998-1999 Toyota \nLand Rover she purchased in 2000 for approximately $18,000. The vehicle was \nrepossessed in 2000 for lack of payments (Tr. 81-82). She claimed the vehicle was \ncontinuously breaking down and she could not afford to make the note payments and \npay for the repair bills. She asked the creditor to take the vehicle back knowing it would \nbe reflected in her credit as a vehicle repossession (Tr. 47-48). \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.j, Applicant believed these were her credit \ncard debts. She had four credit cards with a $300 limit that became delinquent and \naccrued late fees, penalties, and interest (Tr. 49). She was not sure whether the SOR \nalleged duplicated credit card debts. However, she did not contact the creditors to \ninvestigate any of her debts. \n \n3  This is contrary to Applicant\u2019s 2000 sworn statement (GE 2), where she stated she had \nresigned her full time job to care for her ill father. She claimed she had to file for bankruptcy protection \nbecause of her unemployment, lack of income, and her father\u2019s high medical expenses. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k through 1.p concerned rent Applicant owed for an apartment she \nlived in with her boyfriend. She testified she did not understand the delinquent charges \nbecause she did not remember owing anything when she vacated the apartment (Tr. \n50). She did not contact the creditor to investigate of dispute the debts. \n \nIn 2006, Applicant was confronted by a Government investigator concerning her \ncharged off/delinquent debts. She promised to consolidate and/or to resolve her \nfinancial problems. In October 2007, Applicant started working with a consumer \nadvocate law firm on a debt consolidation/settlement program (Tr. 53, GE 8). She was \nsupposed to start the program in October 2007; however, due to unexpected financial \nobligations she did not make the first payment until December 2007. Applicant claimed \nshe made three or four payments towards her consolidation. She presented \ndocumentary evidence of only two payments. She did not make any payments after \nMarch 2008 (Tr. 56). \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt consolidation/settlement program did not include the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.h, 1.k-1.o, 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, and 1.w. As of her hearing day, not one \nof the debts listed in the debt consolidation/settlement program and not one of the debts \nlisted in the SOR have been paid or resolved (Tr. 58). Outside of her participation on the \ndebt consolidation/settlement program, Applicant presented little evidence of efforts to \ncontact creditors, settle, resolve, or to dispute her debts (Tr. 58-59).  \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant started a second job (part-time) in an effort to \ngenerate additional income to pay/resolve her debts (Tr. 59-51). She claimed to follow a \nmonthly financial budget, but presented no document to support her claim. Her current \ncombined take-home income is approximately $3,000. Her monthly expenses include: \n$500 for rent; $100 food expenses; $280 car payment; $500 gas; $52 insurance; $100 \ncell phone; $142 cable T.V.; and $700 for day care expenses, for a total of \napproximately $2,400 (Tr. 61-65). Applicant appears to have a $600 remainder after \npaying her monthly expenses (Tr. 66). She could not explain what she does with the \n$600 remainder on a monthly basis.  \n \nAlthough many of her delinquent debts are relatively small (under $1,000), she \nmade little or no effort to contact her creditors and did not pay any of her debts. \nApplicant explained she could not afford to pay for her day-to-day living expenses and \nher past financial obligations (Tr. 80).  \n \nExcept for her participation in the debt consolidation/settlement program, \nApplicant did not seek or participate in any financial counseling. She expressed remorse \nfor her past financial problems. She asserted she is doing the best she can under her \ncircumstances. She noted her good job performance for Government contractors since \n1990, and that she is responsible and reliable. Applicant presented two character \nreferences (AEs 3 & 4): One from a supervisor who has known her for eight years, and \nthe second from her mother. Applicant is considered a woman of integrity and honesty. \nShe is dedicated to her family and her work. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \n \nIn her March 2008 SF 86, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 28(a) (asking \nwhether in the last seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts), \nand to question 28(b) (asking whether she was currently 90 days delinquent on any \ndebts). She deliberately failed to disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.r.  \n \nWhen she submitted her March 2008 SF 86, Applicant knew she was having \ntrouble paying her debts, but claimed she had no idea her debt was so large (Tr. 52). \nApplicant claimed her failure to disclose her delinquent/charged off debts was not \nintentional, but caused by her failure to review the security clearance form prior to its \nsubmission (Tr. 85).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                          \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern are under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in her credit reports, her SOR \n \n5  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                                          \nresponse, and her testimony. Since her 2000 bankruptcy discharge, she acquired \nnumerous debts which became delinquent and have remained outstanding for many \nyears. As of the hearing date, she had 22 outstanding debts totaling approximately \n$39,000. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,6 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact \ncreditors, or to resolve any of the debts since she acquired them. Nor is there any \nevidence that she has participated in meaningful financial counseling.   \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) \nand conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent. Applicant\u2019s testimony established \nfactors that may be considered as circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her debts, i.e., being a single mother and sole provider for her son, the \nlack of financial assistance from her son\u2019s father; and her failed relationship.  \n \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a \nwhole. \n\n \n \n8 \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt \nresponsibly with her financial obligations before, or after receipt of the SOR. Applicant \nhas been consistently employed and earned money for extended periods of time. She \npresented little or no evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented \nnegotiations, \ncompleted \npayment \nplans, \nbudgets, \nor \nmeaningful \nfinancial \nassistance/counseling with respect to her SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s financial history and \nlack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility, or that she has taken control of her financial situation. Based on \nthe available evidence, she is overextended financially and her financial problems are \nlikely to be a concern in the future. Her financial problems are recent, not isolated, and \nongoing.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG & 15.  \n \nApplicant failed to disclose relevant information in her answers to questions \n28(a), and 28(b) of her security clearance application. Considering the record as a \nwhole, I am convinced Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the information. \nNumerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including: \nApplicant=s maturity, her employment history, her familiarity with the security clearance \nprocess, her demeanor and testimony, the number and value of the debts, her long term \ndisregard of the debts, and the lack of credibility of her explanations.  \n \nBecause of her extensive experience working for Government contractors and \nwith the security clearance process, Applicant knew the importance of accurately \ncompleting her security clearance application, and nevertheless failed to provide \ninformation that was material to making an informed security decision. AG \u00b6 16(a) \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire,\u201d applies. \n \n \n \nAG & 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find it does not \napply since her behavior is recent and shows Applicant\u2019s lack of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n \n9 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s 18 years working for Government contractors and holding a security \nclearance weighs in her favor. There is no evidence to show that she has compromised \nor caused others to compromise classified information. Nor is there evidence showing \nthat she has ever failed to follow the rules and procedures required to handle classified \ninformation. She has no police record, and there is no evidence she has used or \ntrafficked in illegal drugs. Aside from her delinquent debts (which are a civil, non-\ncriminal issue), she is a law-abiding citizen, a concerned daughter, and a caring mother. \nShe expressed regrets for her financial mistakes and claimed she is trying to correct \nthem.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in her case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, and maturity, she demonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness \nin the handling of her financial affairs. She failed to deal responsibly with her financial \nobligations. Her failure or inability to live within her means and to meet her financial \nobligations indicates poor self-control or an unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. Based on the available evidence, she is overextended financially and her \nfinancial problems are likely to be a concern in the future.  \n \nBecause of her many years holding access to classified information and her \nexperience with the security clearance process, Applicant knew or should have known \nthe importance of the trust placed on her by the government. She failed to be candid \nand honest, in her security clearance application, and broke the trust placed on her. Her \nbehavior shows she lacks judgment.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations and personal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.x:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On June 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline G, Guideline H, and Guideline E, that provided the basis for its decision to\ndeny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 20, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 1,\n2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for him. On September 4, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nSeptember 30, 2008.\nOctober 21, 2008\n\n2\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government submitted five exhibits (Ex.\n1-5) that were admitted without any objections. Applicant testified and submitted one\nexhibit (Ex. A) to which the government did not object. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing\nwas received on October 9, 2008. Based on review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant consumed\nalcohol at times to excess and intoxication from about 1995 to at least April 2006 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a); that he was arrested in 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and April\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for driving under the influence (DUI); and that he received 30 days of\ninpatient treatment beginning in April 2006 for alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Under\nGuideline H, drug involvement, Applicant was alleged to have used methadone without\na prescription, with varying frequency up to daily, to at least April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) to\ndeal with a dependence on OxyContin (SOR \u00b6 2.b); to have purchased methadone from\nstreet dealers (SOR \u00b6 2.c); to have been arrested for possession of narcotics\n(unprescribed methadone) as well as DUI in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.d), and to have been\ntreated for pain medication dependency during the 30 days inpatient program (SOR \u00b6\n2.e). DOHA alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct, that Applicant deliberately\nfailed to disclose his use of unprescribed methadone on his security clearance\napplication (SOR \u00b6 3.a).\nApplicant admitted the alcohol consumption and drug involvement allegations. He\ninitially denied that he had intentionally falsified his security clearance application, but\non redirect admitted that he had not disclosed his drug involvement. After considering\nthe record evidence, I make the following additional findings.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old second class rigger who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since June 2005 (Ex. 1, Tr. 18-20), with the exception of a five-\nmonth layoff from September 2006 (Tr. 54-55). There is no indication that the\nDepartment of Defense has previously granted him a security clearance (Tr. 117-18). \nApplicant started drinking alcohol (primarily beer) in about 1995 when he was a\nfreshman in high school. He was depressed following the death of his father and began\ndrinking about 12 beers once weekly on the weekends at parties with friends and\nacquaintances (Ex. 3, Tr. 27, 82). He also smoked marijuana on occasion (Tr. 69-70).\nAfter graduating from high school in June 1998, he attended a community college for\none year (Ex. 2, Tr. 22-23). In about May 1999, he was arrested for DUI. His license\nwas suspended for six months (Ex. 1, 2).\nIn June 1999, he began working on a road crew for the town\u2019s highway\ndepartment (Ex. 1, 2, Tr. 22). His coworkers drank and used illegal drugs, and Applicant\nbegan using the substances with them (Tr. 74). He continued to drink alcohol at a\nfrequency of two to three times per week (Ex. 3). He used cocaine about 20 times at\nparties between 2000 and April 2006 (Tr. 70-72), usually in combination with alcohol,\n\n3\nand tried hallucinogenic mushrooms three times during the 2000/01 time frame (Tr. 73).\nHe also continued to smoke marijuana \u201ca couple times a week maybe\u201d (Tr. 74) until\nabout 2003/04.\nOn one occasion in January 2005, Applicant consumed four beers at the town\ngarage after he ended his work shift. En route home, he was involved in a minor traffic\naccident in which the other driver sustained a wrist injury. He was arrested for DUI after\nhe failed to complete field sobriety tests. At the station, he was administered a\nbreathalyser that showed a breath alcohol level over the legal limit (Ex. 3).\nApplicant managed to remain alcohol free for about a month after his arrest.\nThen in February/March 2005, he was offered some OxyContin by his cousin. He used\nthem recreationally at parties on the weekends (\u201cIt was maybe twice a week, and then\nsome weeks I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Tr. 64-65). By Spring 2006, he was addicted to\nOxyContin, ingesting the drug at times daily and becoming sick when he did not use it.\nHe purchased the drug from street dealers (Tr. 65) and did not obtain a prescription.\n \nIn application for a job with his present employer, Applicant completed a SF 86\non May 19, 2005, on which he disclosed the 1999 DUI and the pending January 2005\nDUI charge, adding in part, \u201cDMV STATES NOT GUILTY/PENDING COURT DATE.\u201d\nApplicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 27 concerning any illegal use of drugs since the\nage of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter (Ex. 1) because he didn\u2019t think he\nwould get the job if he listed his drug use (Tr. 81-82).\nIn June 1995, Applicant began working for the defense contractor (Tr.  23). He\nstayed away from drugs long enough to pass a drug test required of new hires (Tr. 75).\nIn February 2006, he was asked to review and update the SF 86 that he had completed\nin May 2005. In the presence of an employee in the company\u2019s security department (Tr.\n80), he corrected information about his schooling and employment with the town, but did\nnot change his negative response to question 27, even though he was regularly abusing\nOxyContin. On February 2, 2006, Applicant certified by signature that his statements on\nthe SF 86 were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief\nand [were] made in good faith.\u201d (Ex. 2).\nIn about early April 2006, Applicant began taking unprescribed methadone (a\nsynthetic narcotic) in lieu of OxyContin in an effort to deal with his addiction. He\nobtained the methadone from a street dealer (Tr. 66-67). About one week later, he was\nstopped by the state police for failing to drive in marked lanes. He failed field sobriety\ntests and was taken into custody for DUI. While being processed at the state police\nfacility, he was found to be in possession of methadone tablets not prescribed for him\nand he allegedly made threats to the arresting officer. Charges of DUI, possession of\nnarcotics, and second degree threatening were filed against him. Under a plea bargain,\nApplicant was convicted of reckless driving on the January 2005 charge and DUI for the\nApril 2006 offense. The drug possession and threatening charges were dismissed. He\nwas fined $550 for reckless driving. For the April 2006 DUI, he was sentenced to one\nyear probation, to one year license suspension, 100 hours of community service or 48\n\nApplicant testified, with no rebuttal from the government, that he began his aftercare \u201cbasically right\n1\nafter\u201d he completed the inpatient program (Tr. 41). The available progress notes date only from December 10,\n2007 (Ex. A), but the physician\u2019s notes of that session do not indicate that it was an intake or initial session.\nSuboxone (buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride) has been approved by the\n2\nFood and Drug Administration for treatment of opiate dependence. Suboxone prevents symptoms of\nwithdrawal from heroin and other opiates (Ex. 5).\n4\nhours in jail, and a $1,200 fine. Applicant served jail time in lieu of the community\nservice and his fines were paid by mid-September 2006 (Ex. 3).\nRealizing that he needed help with \u201ca problem with pills in general\u201d (Tr. 32),\nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself to a 29-day substance abuse treatment program\non or about April 13, 2006 (Ex. 3, Tr. 28-31). Following group sessions, individual\ncounseling, video presentations, and lectures in treatment of dependency on alcohol\nand narcotic pain medications, he was discharged on May 12, 2006, having\nsuccessfully completed the program (Ex. 3). It was recommended that he attend\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and aftercare counseling (Tr. 58). He attended only a\ncouple of AA meetings, but began a monthly therapeutic relationship with a physician\nassociated with the inpatient facility, who has continued to prescribe Suboxone\nmedication to reduce Applicant\u2019s cravings for OxyContin (Tr. 38, 41, 56).  Applicant had\n1\nbeen on antidepressants during his inpatient stay, but chose not to take them after his\ndischarge because he did not like the way they made him feel (Tr. 85).\nOn September 13, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his January 2005 and April 2006 arrests. Applicant admitted that a breathalyser\ntest administered to him after his arrest in January 2005 showed a blood alcohol content\ngreater than .08%. He refused to submit to a breathalyser after the April 2006 arrest, but\nfailed field sobriety tests, and subsequently pled guilty to that DUI. Applicant\nacknowledged he had problems with alcohol and with addiction to pain medication\n(OxyContin), and that he had taken methadone daily before he entered rehabilitation in\nan effort to deal with his OxyContin dependence. He had since completed inpatient\nrehabilitation and was currently in outpatient aftercare with a physician, who had placed\nhim on Suboxone.  Applicant denied any use of alcohol or unprescribed drugs since he\n2\nentered the inpatient program or any intent to use alcohol or drugs in the future.\nApplicant denied any intentional falsification of his February 2006 SF 86 and stated that\nhe did not think of updating his security form because he was focused on getting help\nfor his alcohol/drug problem (Ex. 3).\nDuring his inpatient treatment and in aftercare, Applicant has been told to abstain\nfrom alcohol, although his physician\u2019s focus has been to wean him off the pills (Tr. 57).\nApplicant relapsed on about five occasions between September 2006 and September\n2007, drinking to intoxication when out socializing, including once with a neighbor.\nApplicant continues to socialize with coworkers, playing pool at \u201csteak nights\u201d the last\nThursday of the month. Applicant does not attend these outings as often as in the past.\nWhen he attends, he always plays pool but has refrained from drinking for the past year\n\n5\n(Tr. 36-37, 94-95). He continues to \u201chave cravings to drink\u2013big time.\u201d (Tr. 97). Applicant\ndid not inform his physician of any of his alcohol relapses (Tr. 57).\nApplicant considers his abuse of narcotics to be his worst problem (\u201cThe pills\ntook a hold [of] me and I\u2019m fighting them.\u201d Tr. 58), even though he cannot stop drinking\nonce he starts (Tr. 61). With the help of Suboxone, he had not used any OxyContin,\nmethadone, or cocaine since April 2006 (Tr. 38). His coworkers are aware that he is not\nabusing drugs any longer (Tr. 99). As of August/September 2008, Applicant continued\nto report to his physician that he was \u201cclean and sober\u201d but that he was not ready for a\ndecrease in the dosage of Suboxone (Ex. A). He told his physician that he was\nexperiencing an increase in anxiety during his office visits in August and September\n2008 (Ex. A). His physician is not treating him specifically for the anxiety and depression\nthat led him to drink and abuse drugs (Tr. 38), but Applicant finds the Suboxone helpful.\nOn a few occasions, Applicant ingested more than the prescribed dosage (\u201cif I\u2019m on\none, I\u2019ll take one and a half cause I get sick feelings, or anxiety.\u201d Tr. 93), but he\nmanaged to stretch out his medication until his next appointment (Tr. 94). Applicant has\nnot told the physician that he has taken more than the prescribed dosage of Suboxone.\nHe does not intend to continue to see the physician once he is off the pills (Tr. 103-04).\nApplicant continues to associate with his old friends with whom he abused drugs\nin the past but he has not found himself in a situation where others are using drugs in\nhis presence. These friends come over to his house, although he does not go out with\nthem (Tr. 106-07).\nApplicant loves his job as a rigger (Tr. 53). He works as many weekends as he is\nallowed (Tr. 95-96) and has a good attendance record (Ex. 3). He was promoted\nthrough the ranks early (\u201cI pretty much have gotten [an] early jump right through.\u201d Tr.\n54). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG & 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant had his first drink when he was a freshman in high school.\nHe drank to excess on weekends in high school, and eventually over the years\ndeveloped a problem to the point where he cannot stop drinking once he starts. His\nabuse of alcohol led to three arrests for DUI, in 1999, January 2005, and April 2006.\nAlthough he pled guilty to reckless driving in the January 2005 incident, he admits that\nhis blood alcohol content was over the legal limit. AG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse\nabuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d), applies to all three\noffenses. His record of drunk driving and of drinking to intoxication after he completed\nthe inpatient program implicate AG \u00b6 22(c) (\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to\n\n7\nthe point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d).\nThe government\u2019s case for consideration of AG \u00b6 22(f) (\u201crelapse after diagnosis\nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram\u201d) is less compelling. Applicant\u2019s admission to a problem with alcohol, to being\nunable to drink in moderation, suggests a dependency problem, but it falls short of\nproving the diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence required under AG \u00b6 22(f). The\nadjudicative conditions, be they disqualifying or mitigating, cannot be viewed in isolation\nor applied inconsistently. Under Guideline G, those persons duly qualified to make a\ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence or abuse are medical professionals (physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) (see AG \u00b6 22(d)), or licensed clinical social workers on\nstaff of a recognized alcohol treatment program (see AG \u00b6 22(e)). The progress notes\nfrom Applicant\u2019s current medical provider are cursory and do not contain a diagnosis.\nThe treatment records from the inpatient program were not made available for review.\nHowever, Applicant still has a substantial burden to mitigate his abusive drinking, given\nthe repeated DUI offenses and his recent relapses following treatment.\nAG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) cannot\nreasonably be applied in mitigation. Assuming Applicant was candid when he told a\ngovernment investigator in September 2006 that he had last consumed alcohol in April\n2006, and that he has been free from alcohol for a year as of September 2008, then the\nfive instances of intoxication were between September 2006 and September 2007. \nAlthough it took a third DUI arrest for him to realize that he had a problem with\nalcohol, Applicant deserves credit for pursuing inpatient treatment voluntarily and for\nsuccessfully completing the program (see AG \u00b6 23(b) (\u201cthe individual acknowledges his\nor her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to\novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser\u201d)). Yet although he has been\nabstinent for one year, I am unable to conclude that his abusive drinking is safely in the\npast. He continues to socialize in settings where he abused alcohol after his inpatient\ntreatment program, and he still has cravings to drink. He has not complied with\ntreatment recommendations to attend AA meetings, and he has not informed his\ntreating physician of his relapses. It is unclear whether he has the insight and/or support\nnetwork to maintain sobriety in the long term, especially given his admitted inability to\ndrink in moderation once he starts drinking. He fulfills the initial treatment component  of\nAG \u00b6 23(d) (\u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear\nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous\nor a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\n\n8\nrecognized treatment program\u201d), but lacks the favorable prognosis and full compliance\nwith aftercare required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(d).\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an illegal\ndrug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  Applicant, who used marijuana in high school, was introduced to more\ndangerous drugs such as cocaine by coworkers when he was part of the town\u2019s road\ncrew. In about February or March 2005, he was introduced to OxyContin by his cousin,\nand he began abusing the drug on weekends within his social circle. By early 2006, he\nwas abusing the drug on a daily basis and purchasing it from street dealers. In late\nMarch/early April 2006, he turned to methadone in lieu of the OxyContin and used that\ndrug, which also was not prescribed for him, on a daily basis for about a week or so\nuntil he was arrested, in part, for illegal possession of the synthetic narcotic.\nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d) and AG \u00b6 25(c) (\u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d) are clearly pertinent to an\nassessment of his security suitability.\nAlthough Applicant has admitted an addiction to OxyContin, and treatment for his\ndependency on pain medication in April 2006, the government did not present medical\nrecords confirming a formal diagnosis of dependency rendered by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or by a licensed clinical social worker affiliated with a recognized\ndrug treatment program, so neither AG \u00b6 25(d) nor AG \u00b6 25(f) are pertinent. The\nevidentiary record also falls short of AG \u00b6 25(g) (\u201cany illegal drug use after being\ngranted a security clearance\u201d). It is undisputed that Applicant abused drugs after he\nstarted working for the defense contractor. During closing argument, it was revealed\nthat Applicant had been granted a \u201ccompany confidential\u201d by his employer (Tr. 117-18),\nbut there was no indication that Applicant had been granted a Department of Defense\nclearance.\nApplicant bears a substantial burden to overcome the judgment and reliability\nconcerns raised by his illegal abuse of addictive opiates like OxyContin and methadone.\nHe has abstained from methadone, OxyContin, and illicit drugs such as cocaine since\nhe entered inpatient treatment in April 2006. But he is managing to deal with his\nnarcotics\u2019 problem only because of Suboxone. While this drug is legally prescribed and\nhe remains under the care of the prescribing physician, Applicant has on occasion taken\nin excess of the prescribed dosage:\nReally, certain days, you just\u2013if\u2013you either get\u2013sumpin\u2019 [sic] bad happens\nso you get anxiety. Or even if, you know, you get\u2013your tolerance for it\nget\u2013grows, you know, and you can start feeling lousy, so certain days, I\nhave to\u2013I do take more than the one pill, but I just fight to make sure I\n\n9\nmake it to the next, cause I don\u2019t wanna be without nothing, you know. But\nI have abu\u2013you know, gone over the dosage. (Tr. 104)\nHe has not mentioned to his physician that he has exceeded the prescribed dosage. His\ntendency to self-medicate, which was exhibited in the past by his effort to wean himself\noff OxyContin by resorting to methadone, is itself drug abuse under Guideline H (see\nAG \u00b6 24(b) (\u201cdrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner\nthat deviates from approved medical direction\u201d)). It shows that Applicant is continuing to\nstruggle to overcome his drug problem. As of September 2008, he told his physician\nthat he was not ready to decrease the dosage of his Suboxone after more than two\nyears of taking the drug. His friends with whom he illegally used drugs in the past know\nthat he is not using, but I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 26(b) (\u201ca demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future\u201d), despite his abstinence from OxyContin, methadone,\nand cocaine since April 2006.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant had used marijuana off and on from high school until 2003/04 and\ncocaine about 20 times between 1999 and April 2006. In about February or March\n2005, he began using OxyContin on weekends. He concealed this drug involvement\nwhen he completed his initial security clearance application in May 2005  because he\nfeared he would not be hired if he disclosed it. When asked to update his SF 86 in\nFebruary 2006, he made no effort to correct his knowingly false answer to question 27.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d) applies.\nApplicant is credited with candor about the extent of his drug involvement at his\nhearing. He even admitted abusing his Suboxone medication by taking more than the\nprescribed dosage on occasion, and to using cocaine on about 20 occasions before he\nentered the inpatient rehabilitation program in April 2006. However, his rectification is\nnot sufficiently prompt to qualify for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts\u201d). When presented an opportunity to be forthcoming\nabout his drug abuse in a September 2006 subject interview, Applicant averred he was\n\n10\naddicted to pain medication, but there is no indication in the record that he told the\ninvestigator about his involvement with cocaine or marijuana. When initially asked on\ndirect examination about his negative response to question 27 concerning any illegal\ndrug use, Applicant was not candid, as the following exchange shows.\nQ You denied intentional falsification. Your answer was in fact wrong. Is\nthat right?\nA Was wrong, yes.\nQ Because you did use prescription drugs.\nA Yes. But when I went up to Security, I don\u2019t how I missed that one up,\nbut they kept calling me up to update my clearance information cause I\nhad the new arrest, and everything, and I don\u2019t know when I answered\nthat. But I\u2019m really unsure when I did that, cause I put down all my, usually\nput down all my stuff. But that\u2019s really all I can say for that. I don\u2019t know\nwhat I did there.\n(Tr. 49-50). When asked on cross examination to explain his negative responses to\nquestion 27 on both the May 2005 (Ex. 1) and February 2006 (Ex. 2) security clearance\napplications, Applicant admitted that he had lied (\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t wanna put\ndown that I used all sorts a [sic] drugs, and you know, knowing that I wouldn\u2019t get hired.\nI mean, I\u2019m sure a lotta people do that, you know.\u201d Tr. 81-82). When his attorney later\nsought to amend the Answer to the SOR based on his admission to the falsification,\nApplicant responded, \u201cWell, on the first one I guess, yes. But as far as when I updated\nit, I just filled out the arrest thing. So I don\u2019t know which form\u2013I guess yes\u2013basically yes.\nI guess I did leave stuff out, or answer \u2018no\u2019.\u201d (Tr. 88-89). Any knowing equivocation or\nfalse statement is inconsistent with the good judgment and full candor that must be\ndemanded of those persons granted access to classified information. Under the\ncircumstances, none of the mitigating conditions apply, including AG \u00b6 17(d) (\u201cthe\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur\u201d).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\nTreatment is viewed favorably, but the allegation is resolved against him because of the excessive\n3\ndrinking that led to treatment, and that occurred after he completed the inpatient program.\n11\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s abusive drinking with three\ndrunk driving incidents, and his extensive illegal use of controlled substances, to as\nrecently as April 2006, raise very serious doubts for his judgment and ability to comply\nwith rules and regulations (see AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1) and 2(a)(3)). His inpatient treatment with\naftercare consisting largely of Suboxone medication to control any cravings for narcotics\nis a credible step in reform (see AG \u00b6 2(a)(6)), but it is too soon to conclude that there is\nlittle likelihood of recurrence (see AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). He relapsed by drinking to excess about\nfive times, and he self-medicated by taking more than his prescribed dosage of\nSuboxone while in aftercare. Even though his intent was not to \u201cget high\u201d (Tr. 103), he\nexhibited poor judgment in not informing his physician that the prescribed dosage was\ninsufficient to deal with his symptoms. Despite his struggles with alcohol and narcotics,\nhe managed to perform his work duties in a clearly acceptable manner, as evidenced by\nhis early step promotions. Yet the government can ill afford to take the risk of a future\nrelapse, or of Applicant again putting his personal interest ahead of his obligations, as he\ndid when he falsely denied any illegal drug involvement on his security clearance\napplications. Applicant may eventually succeed in becoming \u201ccompletely clean,\u201d but\nbased on present circumstances, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant3\n\n12\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nELIZABETH M.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Eric A. Eisen, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on December 1,\n2006. On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign\ninfluence (Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is dated March 1, 2008. His answer was notarized\non March 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 28, 2008, and the hearing\nwas held on May 27, 2008. Based on a careful evaluation of all the evidence in the\nrecord, Applicant\u2019s eligibility of security clearance access is denied. \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n2\nAt the hearing, the government submitted two exhibits (GE). The third exhibit (GE\n3, administrative notice exhibit) contains publications from United States Government\nagencies that describe the Government of China, its human rights record internally, its\npractice collecting intelligence from other countries, and the various difficulties U.S.\ncitizens face in travelling to the country. At Applicant\u2019s request, I have also taken\nadministrative notice of the Adjudicative Desk Reference (ADR), Version 3.1, dated\nSeptember 2007. The ADR is identified as AE F. At the hearing, testimony was taken\nfrom Applicant. He also submitted five exhibits (AE A-AE E). I have included AE F as his\nsixth exhibit. DOHA received the transcript on June 5, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges in paragraph 1 that Applicant\u2019s ties in the Peoples Republic of\nChina (PRC) raise foreign influence concerns. He admitted subparagraphs 1.a. through\n1.e. \nApplicant is 45 years old and married. He has been employed as a development,\ndata base administrator for a defense contractor since August 2004. He seeks a secret\nsecurity clearance. He has never held a security clearance. \nOn January 31, 1963, Applicant was born in the PRC. His parents, brother, and\nparents-in-law were born in and are resident citizens of the PRC. Applicant attended\nschool in China and received his Bachelor\u2019s degree in Physics in 1984. After working in\na copper rod factory for several years, he immigrated to the United States (U. S.) in\n1990 for educational purposes; his uncle, an American citizen living in Hong Kong,\nsponsored Applicant\u2019s student visa, as everyone (foreigners) who studies in the U.S.,\naccording to Applicant, needs a financial sponsor, someone who will be financially\nresponsible for the person they sponsor. (Tr. 31) Applicant spent a semester at a\ncollege in the middle of the U.S. He then transferred to another college in the\nnortheastern part of the U.S., where he received his Master\u2019s degree in Electrical\nEngineering in May 1993. Applicant paid for his U.S. education from savings he\naccumulated while working in the PRC, and from full-time and/or part-time work at a\nhotel where he ultimately received his engineering degree. \nAfter receiving his Engineering degree in May 1993, Applicant worked as a\nsubcontractor for a U.S. federal agency. In 1994, he obtained his permanent resident\ncard. In January 1996, he met his future wife, and married her in the U.S. in October\n1996. Then, they moved to the local area. Since August 1997, Applicant has been\nemployed in data base administration jobs. In November 1998, Applicant purchased his\nhome in the local area. (AE A)\nApplicant was naturalized in this country on March 18, 1999, and obtained his\nU.S. passport in July 1999. Applicant\u2019s wife gave birth to a child in July 2001. His wife,\nwho immigrated to the U.S. in 1992, received her U.S. citizenship on January 19, 2006.\nShe is currently employed as a special technician at a hospital. \n\n3\nApplicant has travelled back to the PRC on four occasions. The first occasion\nwas in April 1994 for a family reunion. The second trip was in September 1999 when he\nand his wife travelled together to first Hong Kong, and then their home domiciles in the\nPRC. In April 2004, Applicant, his wife and son returned to China so their parents could\nsee their child. In November 2006, Applicant travelled alone for vacation.\nApplicant\u2019s mother (SOR 1.a.) was born in the PRC on November 16, 1938. She\nis currently retired from working in a wire manufacturing factory where Applicant\u2019s father\nwas also employed. She worked in the maintenance workshop of the factory.\nApplicant\u2019s father (SOR 1.b) was born in the PRC on July 5, 1934, and retired from the\nwire manufacturing company in 1994. The Chinese government pays their pension. On\nMay 9, 1964, Applicant\u2019s brother (SOR 1.c.) was born in the PRC. He currently is\nunemployed from a job with a wireless telecommunications company. Applicant believes\nthat his brother is receiving income from some kind of investment, though Applicant did\nnot appear to be certain of the source of the investment income. See, Tr. 94. Applicant\u2019s\nparents and brother are resident citizens of the PRC. \nRegarding contacts with his parents and brother, Applicant stated in his interview\nin May 2007 (affirmed by him on November 10, 2007 in GE 2) that he had weekly\ntelephone contact with his parents, and monthly contact with his brother. At the hearing,\nApplicant believed the telephone contact to be once every two or three weeks with his\nparents, and approximately every two months with his brother. Applicant has affection\nfor his parents and brother, but he does not think he would disclose any information to\nthem. (Tr. 58-60)\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law (SOR 1.d.) was born in China on April 7, 1945. She is a\nretired professor. She was a doctor (Tr. 69), then a pharmacist (Tr. 71), before she\nretired. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law (SOR 1.e.) was born in the PRC on August 23, 1944.\nHe received his education in China. He is a retired heart surgeon and also president of\na hospital in the PRC. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law made a business-related trip to the U.S.\nfor three days in May 1997. He also came in August 2001 when Applicant\u2019s son was\nborn. His father-in-law\u2019s most recent business-related trip to the U.S. was for two or\nthree days in 2003. Applicant does not have any direct contact with his father-in-law or\nmother-in-law, but noted in GE 2 that his wife talked to them weekly by telephone. See,\nTr. 72. Applicant also has a sister-in-law (wife\u2019s sister) who is a resident citizen of China\nnot mentioned in the SOR. She is married and works for a German company that\nimports and exports goods. Applicant seldom talks with her. (Tr. 106-107)\nApplicant testified he provides no support to his parents, brother or in-laws. He\nhas sent his parents money on a couple of occasions out of pleasure and/or a sign of\nrespect. (Tr. 55) Applicant disagreed with the first sentence of the first paragraph of\npage 2 of GE 2, regarding the sending of $2,500.00 to his parents as a holiday present.\nIn his effort to clarify the sentence, Applicant stated he told the investigator that he sent\n$2,500.00 in 2006 (Tr. 111-112) to his parents. Then, Applicant stated he actually gave\nhis parents a $2,500.00 gift in 2006, and a $2,500.00 gift in 2007. (Tr. 122) Regarding\nthe second sentence of the first paragraph of GE 2, referring to the $300.00 to $500.00\n\n U.S. Department of State, Background Note: China, dated October 2007 (Background Note on China) at 7-8.\n1\n4\ngifts he sends to his parents as birthday gifts, Applicant testified he terminated that\npractice in 2005. (Id.) The third sentence in the first paragraph of the second page of\nGE 2 refers to money to pay for medications and occasional stock investments for\nApplicant\u2019s father. During his testimony, Applicant provided testimony directed at\nclarifying the statement, however, his testimony was somewhat ambiguous. See, Tr.\n115- 120. My factual finding is that Applicant sent his father $2,500.00 for medication in\n2005 and 2006. The money his father did not use to purchase his medication, was used\nto pay for stock investments.\nApplicant came to the U.S. in 1990 because he was disappointed with the PRC\nfollowing the government reaction to the regional protest in 1989. (Tr. 61) He has no\nplans to return to his country of birth, even for retirement. He will retire in the U.S. \nApplicant has no property, investments, or any other financial interests in China.\n(Tr. 39, GE 1) He has never consulted or had any official contact with a foreign country.\nHe has never belonged to any political organization supporting the PRC. Applicant\u2019s\nloyalty is with the U.S. where he considers the policies are fair. Applicant does not\nbelieve the Chinese government would pressure his parents because his work is not\nvaluable to the PRC. His work involves sensitive personal identity information, not\nclassified information. Applicant and his coworker believe the necessary controls are in\nplace to prevent identity theft or compromise. (Tr. 46-48, AE C)\nThe cousin of Applicant\u2019s mother lives in the U.S. She, her husband and three\nchildren are U.S. citizens. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s operational manager has worked with him for a year and believes he\nis professional, efficient and trustworthy. His coworker of a year thinks Applicant has\nbecome an integral part of the data base team. Applicant\u2019s minister for six years\ncomplimented his work as head usher for several years. In the 10 months his direct\nsupervisor has observed him, Applicant has repeatedly demonstrated his dedication to\nprojects while improving the overall efficiency of the project objective.\nAdministrative Notice\nI have taken administrative notice of the PRC. China has an authoritarian\ngovernment.  Even though there are ostensibly three branches of government, real\n1\ngovernment control rests in the Chinese Communist Party. On January 1, 1979, the\nU.S. officially transferred diplomatic recognition from Taipei, Taiwan to Beijing, China,\nand restated the Chinese position that there is only one China. Over the next several\nyears, U.S. contacts with the PRC broadened to cover more and more issues involving\n\n Background Note on China at 15-16.\n2\n Id. at 17-18.\n3\n U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 2007 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China\n4\nEconomic and Security Review commission, dated November 2007, at 104.\n U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007: China (includes Tibet, Hong\n5\nKong, and Macau, dated March 11, 2008, at 9.\n5\nregional and global problems, political-military matters, as well as cultural/artistic and\neducational exchange activities.  \n2\nThe Tiananmen Square quelling of demonstrators in June 1989 triggered a\nsuspension of high-level exchanges and weapon exports by the U.S., together with a\ncall by western nations for political and economic reform in areas related to human\nrights. The relationship between the two countries has been tested over the years by (1)\nthe continuing sale of military weapons by the U.S. to Taiwan, (2) by the accidental\nbombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, and (3) by the collision of a\nPRC plane and a U.S. plane in April 2001.  \n3\nBecause of its global position of prominence in the Pacific and Asian regions, and\nthe large number of Chinese Americans in the U.S., the Chinese direct large intelligence\ncollection activities at the U.S. These activities are conducted by a large professional\nintelligence system, PRC institutes and factories, and PRC students, delegations, and\ncommercial enterprises. A weakness of PRC-intelligence-gathering is that the\nmethodology used to gather intelligence is inefficient. However, the unlimited number of\nPRC intelligence collectors know exactly what kind of information they are searching for\nin the U.S. to meet their intelligence needs. \nWhile the PRC has always asserted it is not involved in espionage operations or\nintelligence gathering against U.S. targets, a top U.S. counterintelligence official noted\nthat China is the most aggressive collector of U.S. intelligence. In July 2007, the\nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) increased counterintelligence\noperations because of China\u2019s increasing intelligence activities in the U.S.  \n4\nChina\u2019s poor record on human rights is exemplified by its miserable handling of\npolitical dissent, and other critical issues related to due process of law, freedom to\npractice religion and freedom to travel. Internal monitoring of communication systems,\ne.g., telephones, facsimiles, electronic mail, inspection of domestic and international\nmail, and surveillance, including unannounced searches of residences, offices, and\nhotels are commonplace in the PRC. American tourists must register with the local\npolice as soon as they arrive in the PRC.  \n5\nPolicies\n\n6\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law that recognize the complexities of\nhuman behavior, and are to be applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened\nrisk/conflict of interest of forcing an applicant into a position of having to choose\nbetween the foreign entity and the U.S. \nAnalysis\n\n7\n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests result in security concerns\nwhere those contacts and interests create divided loyalties, or may be manipulated or\ninduced by a foreign entity that is harmful to U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign entity. Decisions under this guideline should include the foreign\ncountry where the contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to\nwhether the foreign government targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information\nand/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d \nThe mere possession of family ties in a foreign country is not automatically\ndisqualifying under the FI guideline. ISCR Case No. 98-0507 (App. Bd. Dec. and Rem.\nOrd., May 17, 1999) at 10. However, when the citizenship and resident status of\nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother and in-laws in the PRC are weighed against the type\nauthoritarian government of the PRC and its intense intelligence gathering apparatus\ndirected at the U.S., security concerns are raised under Foreign Influence (FI)\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) Applicant has regular contact with his\nparents and brother on a weekly or monthly basis. Although not alleged in the SOR,\nApplicant has travelled to see his parents in the PRC on four occasions in the last nine\nyears. Until 2005, Applicant provided yearly birthday gifts of $300.00 to $500.00 to his\nparents. Applicant also sent his father $2,500.00 in 2006 and 2007 to pay for\nmedication, and to use the remainder for investments. The regular contacts and travel\nto the PRC on four occasions, when considered with the authoritarian nature of the PRC\ngovernment and its record of targeting U.S. citizens to obtain protected or intelligence\ninformation, constitute a heightened risk for foreign influence and pressure. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s in-laws, the Appeal Board has held that there is a\nrebuttable presumption that an applicant has close ties of affection, or at least\nobligation, to members of his wife\u2019s family. ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 8 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 20, 2002). Therefore, the heightened risk for foreign exploitation and influence\nextends to Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law who are resident citizens of the\nPRC. Even though Applicant has no direct contact with his in-laws, his wife telephones\nthem regularly. \nApplicant\u2019s close connection to his foreign family members who are resident\ncitizens of China also creates a potential for a conflict of interest between his duties to\nprotect classified information and his competing concerns to safeguard his relatives\u2019\ngeneral welfare. These security concerns fall within FI DC 7.b. (connections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation) apply. The fact that Applicant\u2019s parents, brother, and in-laws are still\nresident citizens of the PRC constitute a potential for conflict that shifts the burden to\nApplicant to show why he believes the heightened risk is manageable and he will\nresolve the conflict in favor of the U.S. Applicant bears a heavy burden of showing his\n\n See,  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002) \n6\n8\nfamily members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26983 (October 16,\n2002) \nThe disqualifying conditions under the FI guideline can be mitigated by: FC MC\n8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the position or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.); FI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest); and, FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation). Both Applicant\u2019s mother and father are\nretired from factory jobs. Considered with his brother, there is no indication the three\nhave ever worked for or have been agents of the Chinese government. Though\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is retired from professional medical positions, neither she nor\nher husband, now retired, were ever employed directly by or were agents of the PRC\ngovernment. Given the close relationship Applicant has with his immediate family\nmembers, which cannot be considered casual or infrequent in nature,  and the poor\n6\nhuman rights record of the Chinese government, together with its intelligence activities\ncausing the U.S. government to increase its counterintelligence activities in 2007, the FI\nguideline is resolved against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FI guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant has five immediate family members who are resident citizens of PRC. I\nhave noted that Applicant came to the U.S in 1990 on a student visa, and received\nadditional academic degrees or certificates in this country. I have also considered he\nhas no financial interests or financial obligations in the PRC, and that he has never\nvoted or held foreign office. I have balanced the aforementioned information with\n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s growing ties to the U.S., including his marriage to his wife in 1996, his\nownership of his home since 1998, the birth of his son in this country in 2001, his\nfamily\u2019s involvement with the church, and his participation in the U.S. election process in\nrecent years. Finally, I have carefully evaluated Applicant\u2019s earnest claim that he could\nnot be a target for coercion or influence through his family because the Chinese\ngovernment has determined that his data base, passport services are of no value to the\nChinese government. Given the extensive intelligence gathering practices of the PRC,\nApplicant\u2019s claim is misplaced. Targets for intelligence/information can change as swiftly\nas the underlying information that is being sought. The presence of Applicant\u2019s relatives\nin the PRC, subject to the pressures of that country, place them in a position becoming\na conduit for exploitation in a way that could force Applicant to have to chose between\nhis relatives and the U.S. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nunder the FI guideline, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns of\nforeign influence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on January 29, 2007. On December 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The case was originally assigned to DOHA\u2019s Western Hearing Office. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 22, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR on \nDecember 28, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 22, \n2008, and an Administrative Judge from DOHA\u2019s Western Hearing Office received the \ncase assignment on January 25, 2008. On January 29, 2008, Counsel for Applicant \nentered his notice of appearance, and requested the case be transferred to DOHA\u2019s \nWashington Hearing Office. On February 5, 2008, the Western Hearing Office \ntransferred the case to the Washington Hearing Office. I received the case assignment \non February 11, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 26, 2008, \nscheduling the case for March 26, 2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through S, \nwhich were received without objection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 4, 2008.  \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to include Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent 2008 travel to Hong Kong. Without objection from Applicant, I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion. Tr. 133. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted an \u201cUpdated\u201d Request for Administrative Notice \n(Exhibit (Ex.) I(A)), requesting that I take administrative notice of the summary of facts \ncontained in Ex. I(A) as well as those facts in Exs. I through VIII. Counsel for Applicant \nobjected to Ex. I(A) through VIII by written objection (Ex. I(B) on the grounds of \u201c[l]ate \ndisclosure, cumulative, overly broad or general, opinion offered without basis, \nobjectionable on other grounds, excludable in courts discretion, etc.\u201d After considering \nExs. I(A), I through VIII and I(B), I overruled Counsel for Applicant\u2019s objection, and took \nadministrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which pertained \nto Hong Kong, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Macau. Tr. 16-17.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd.

See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nHong Kong, PRC and Macau were derived from Exs.

China has given Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, except the \nPRC has retained responsibility for defense and foreign policy. Recently, China has \ntaken a more active oversight role of Hong Kong\u2019s control of political developments. \n \nThe Hong Kong government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, \nhowever, reported human rights problems include some political restrictions on the \nlegislature\u2019s power, press self-censorship, violence and discrimination against women, \nand restrictions on workers\u2019 rights to organize and bargain collectively. \n \nThe PRC\u2019s Military Intelligence Department, First Bureau, is responsible for \ncollecting military information about the U.S. The PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security is the \n\u201cpreeminent civilian intelligence collection agency in China,\u201d and maintains intelligence \noperations in Hong Kong, and Macau, through a bureau utilizing PRC nationals with \nHong Kong or Macau connections. \n \nChina has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human \nrights record, suppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention, \nforced confessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment. \n \nChina is a nuclear power with a large Army. China is geographically vast, and \nhas a population of over one billion people. It has significant resources, and an \neconomy that in recent years has expanded about 10% per year. China aggressively \ncompetes with the United States in many areas. PRC\u2019s competitive relationship with the \nUnited States exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s Hong Kong connections.   \n \n \nChina actively collects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information \nabout the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a \nglobal superpower; (2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim \nand Asia; (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology that China desires \nfor economic growth; and (4) China considers the large number of Americans of \nChinese ancestry as intelligence targets. China\u2019s active intelligence gathering programs \nfocus on sensitive and protected U.S. technologies.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n2The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I(A), I-VIII. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n \n3 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n4 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport. \n \n \nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant held dual citizenship with Hong Kong \nand the U.S., and held a valid Hong Kong passport because it was his belief that he \nwas required to demonstrate he was a Hong Kong citizen in order to inherit property \nfrom his parents. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) has been raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \nmitigating to this disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship was derived from his parents and/or residence in \nHong Kong. Applicant not only expressed a willingness to renounce his dual citizenship, \nhe took the extraordinary step of flying to Hong Kong at his own expense in December \n2007/January 2008 for the sole purpose of renouncing his Hong Kong citizenship and \nsurrendering his Hong Kong passport. He also knew such action would also preclude \nhim from inheriting property from his parents, discussed infra. After renouncing his Hong \nKong citizenship and surrendering his Hong Kong passport to Hong Kong authorities, \nhe took the additional step of reporting his actions to the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong. \nIt is difficult to imagine what further steps Applicant could take to mitigate this concern. \nThis concern is deemed mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), 11(b), and 11(e). \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his parents and sister. These close relationships create a potential risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a close \nexamination of all circumstances. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions as a result of Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. The \nGovernment established Applicant\u2019s parents and sister are resident citizens of Hong \nKong, and that Applicant maintains frequent contact with them by telephone/e-mail and \ntravel. The Government also identified the concerns associated with Applicant\u2019s \npotential inheritance of his parents\u2019 home in Hong Kong. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \n \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplying common sense and life experience, there is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, and/or obligation to his immediate family. ISCR \nCase No. 04-07766 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. \nBd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has demonstrated the indicia of ties of affection for/and or \nobligation to his parents and sister by telephone and e-mail contact as well as his travel \nto Hong Kong in 2002, 2006, 2007, and 2008. He made a one-day trip to Macau during \nhis 2007 visit.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are retired and are not associated with or affiliated with the \nHong Kong government. His sister owns a private company and also is not associated \nwith or affiliated with the Hong Kong government. The record does not identify what \ninfluence, if any, the Hong Kong or Chinese government could exert on Applicant\u2019s \nparents and sister as a result of their being resident citizens of Hong Kong. However, \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \ntheir presence in Hong Kong, which is now part of the PRC, and Applicant\u2019s foreign \ntravel creates concerns under this Guideline. As such, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nshow his relatives in Hong Kong and travel there does not create security risks.  \n \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all \nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As \nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cHong Kong, PRC and Macau,\u201d Hong Kong is a part \nof the PRC, which is ruled by a communist government that actively engages in \nintelligence gathering against the U.S. The PRC also has a poor human rights record. \n \nApplicant denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the U.S. and any foreign \ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S. was not challenged in this \nproceeding. The issue is rather a positional one.  \n \n[Guideline B] hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is \nforced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, \nbut rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where he is forced to make such a choice. ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). \n \nOn balance, Applicant has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood \nthat [his relationship with his in-laws] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d The nature of the PRC\u2019s government and its ongoing intelligence \ngathering activities against the U.S. places Applicant in just this position, given his close \nrelationship with his family and their continued presence and connection with Hong \nKong and the PRC. Accordingly, Mitigating Conditions 8(a) and 8(b) do not apply. On \nthe other hand, given the affirmative steps Applicant has taken by renouncing his Hong \nKong citizenship and surrendering his Hong Kong passport to Hong Kong authorities \neffectively precludes him from inheriting property from his parents. When compared with \nhaving no assets in Hong Kong and having little or no likelihood of acquiring property in \nHong Kong through inheritance and his substantial assets in the U.S., application of \nMitigating Condition 8(f) is appropriate for SOR \u00b6 2.c.. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d5 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \n \n \n The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Hong Kong. Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole \nperson analysis.  First, the PRC is a nuclear power and PRC\u2019s government is a rival of \nthe United States. The PRC is an authoritarian, Communist state. More importantly for \nsecurity purposes, PRC actively seeks classified and industrial/economic information. \nThe PRC may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s parents and sister who live in Hong Kong to \nobtain such information. Also, Applicant spent his formative years in Hong Kong. \nApplicant has visited Hong Kong four times recently, i.e. 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2008. \nHis one-day trip to Macau occurred during his 2007 visit to Hong Kong and can hardly \nbe viewed as significant. Applicant did not rule out visiting Hong Kong in the future. \nApplicant also maintains frequent contact with his parents and sister in Hong Kong. \nThese contacts and visits are manifestations of strong affection and regard Applicant \nhas for family members in Hong Kong.    \n \n \nThere is mitigating evidence that weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant immigrated to the U.S. when he was 20 years old, and received his \ncollege education in the U.S. He has lived in the U.S. for the past 20 years, was married \nin the U.S., and has two U.S. born children in the U.S. His assets in the U.S. are \nsubstantial in contrast to having no assets in Hong Kong. He is a U.S. citizen and U.S. \npassport holder. His wife is a U.S. citizen and his in-laws are U.S. citizens. His ties to \nthe United States are stronger than his ties to his parents and sister in Hong Kong. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has ever taken any action which could cause potential \nharm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and \n \nAdams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd.

Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nhe has worked diligently for a Government contractor since January 2007. The evidence \ncontains no derogatory record evidence about the Applicant. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Hong Kong. Hong Kong is no \nlonger a British colony. Hong Kong remains a free and open society where human rights \nare generally respected. It has some autonomy, but remains connected to the PRC. The \nPRC has an authoritarian government, a less than stellar human rights record, and has \na very aggressive espionage program. The PRC conducts intelligence operations in \nHong Kong and Macau. \n \n \nIn the unlikely event that Applicant\u2019s family in Hong Kong were subjected to \ncoercion or duress from the Hong Kong government in an attempt to obtain sensitive \ninformation, I find that because of his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S., that Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress in favor of the United States. Noteworthy is Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent visit to Hong Kong at his own expense for the sole purpose of renouncing his \nHong Kong citizenship, surrendering his Hong Kong passport, and declaring his \nallegiance to the U.S. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Hong Kong Government or its agents might exploit or \nattempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s family members in such a way that this U.S. citizen would \nhave to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family members. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and preference.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n7See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                  Paragraph 2, Guideline B: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.e.: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",
