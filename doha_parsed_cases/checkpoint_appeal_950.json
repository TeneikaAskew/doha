On March 21, 2025, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Tuider denied Applicant national security \neligibility. The Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant has appeared before DOHA twice. The first appearance was in 2020 and \ninvolved allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).

However, after he was granted eligibility, several of his delinquencies \nwere not resolved. \nOn March 17, 2023, DoD issued a second SOR to Applicant, which contained the \nallegations that led to this appeal.

In Applicant\u2019s appeal, he failed to identify any specific error. Instead, he \nargues for an alternative interpretation of the evidence and claims that he feels \u201cpicked on.\u201d He \nappears to read the Judge\u2019s decision as initiating a third adjudication and threat to revoke his \nsecurity clearance eligibility, rather than a reaching a decision on the second (and current) SOR. \nTo the extent that he provides new details about his financial status in his appeal, the Appeal Board \ndoes not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. The Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the \nappealing party has alleged the judge committed harmful error.

On March 21, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Gatha LaFaye denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his mid-40s. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005.

Under Guideline H, \nthe SOR alleged concerns based on the foregoing history, which Applicant admitted with further \nexplanation. The Judge found against Applicant on all concerns. \nApplicant started smoking marijuana at the age of 12, after experiencing a traumatic event. \nHe occasionally used marijuana with friends until he was discovered with marijuana at his middle \nschool in State 1 (S1). His possession of marijuana led to his suspension from school, a guilty plea \nin juvenile court, and supervised probation with random drug urinalysis tests for two years. \nApplicant did not use marijuana during his two-year probation period. \nApplicant resumed marijuana use during his sophomore year of high school, about a year \nafter the end of his supervised probation. In 1997, his parents transferred him to a small, private \nschool. At the request of his parents, his new school performed random drug urinalysis tests and \nrequired him to participate in drug education classes. Applicant said he stopped using marijuana \nat the new school and became more focused. Because of this period of abstinence, Applicant\u2019s \noverall marijuana use during high school was minimal. \nApplicant deferred entry into college for one year. During his \u201cgap year,\u201d he worked full-\ntime as a kennel manager and surgical assistant for a veterinary clinic. He said he probably used \nmarijuana during the period, but that it was not a significant part of his life at that time. \nApplicant enrolled in college in August 2000. It was in State 2, which decriminalized \nmarijuana use in the 1970s. His use of marijuana varied during college from a few times a week \nto a few times a month from 2000 to about 2005. He said he did not recall using marijuana from \nlate 2004 to about 2009. However, he admitted experimenting with a wide range of drugs, \nincluding psychedelic drugs and cocaine through 2007. \nIn late 2009, Applicant was diagnosed with \u201chyperthyroidism\u201d or Graves\u2019 disease and was \ntreated for the condition using radiation therapy. He said he used marijuana daily during this period \nto help with nausea and to increase his appetite. He disclosed his awareness that using marijuana \nwas illegal at the federal and state levels, but he was more concerned about surviving the disease. \nHe said he stopped using marijuana a few weeks after his treatment ended in 2010. He did not \nenjoy using marijuana anymore because he started to feel paranoid after using it. \nApplicant used marijuana on social occasions between 2010 and 2015. In 2015, he \nincreased his marijuana use after State 3 (S3) passed legislation allowing the recreational use of \nmarijuana. Applicant continued to use marijuana while taking his prescribed opioid medication \nuntil he experienced a heart attack in the spring of 2018 at the age of 37. His heart attack caused \nhim to prioritize his health over his work in the music industry. Applicant decided to stop using \nopioid medications for good in December 2019. He found a new doctor (Dr. H), and she diagnosed \nhim with opioid use disorder from the opioid drugs prescribed to him since 2004 to treat pain \nrelated to a \u201ctarsal condition.\u201d Dr. H prescribed him Suboxone at a dose of 16 milligrams (mg) per \nday, to start the process of tapering his use and dependence on opioids. Over time, she was able to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nreduce his daily Suboxone dosage from 16 mg to about 4 mg. He currently takes about 4 mg per \nday and visits with Dr. H monthly. \nIn January 2020, Applicant resumed using marijuana. He used it daily to manage his pain \nfrom his tarsal condition in lieu of opioids. Before the law changed in S1, he purchased marijuana \nfrom dispensaries in S3, traveled with it to his residence in S1, and used it to self-medicate. He \nsaid he believed that S1 had decriminalized marijuana possession for personal use by limiting \npenalties for possession to a very small citation, if any citation was written at all. \nIn May 2020, Applicant obtained a medical marijuana card issued through a medical \nmarijuana pharmacist and healthcare advisor in S1. He was prescribed 3.5 grams of medical \nmarijuana for daily use. In July 2021, S1 changed its laws to permit the recreational use of \nmarijuana. Applicant said S1 also permitted residents to grow and cultivate marijuana in a personal \ngarden, and that he started his own personal marijuana garden in September 2021. Applicant \ndisclosed his medical marijuana use to the defense contractor before he started working with the \nteam in June 2020. The defense contractor\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO), who also worked as \nthe facility security officer, confirmed his statement. The CEO determined Applicant\u2019s use of \nmedical marijuana did not pose a security risk for the organization because he did not need a \nsecurity clearance to perform the job at that time. Applicant provided a copy of his medical \nmarijuana card to the company and remained subject to the company\u2019s drug urinalysis testing \nprogram. Before completing his March 2022 SCA, Applicant said the defense contractor informed \nhim that his medical marijuana use would not prohibit him from being eligible for a security \nclearance. In his October 2022 response to interrogatories, Applicant said he answered \u201cyes\u201d to \nthe question of whether he intended to continue using medical marijuana in the future because he \ndid not know or appreciate that using medical marijuana was disqualifying for national security \neligibility. \nApplicant said he responded to questions in the SCA and his background interview in an \nopen and honest manner, and that he was surprised to receive the November 18, 2022, SOR for \nusing and cultivating medical marijuana. After receiving the SOR and discussing what it meant \nwith a family member and lawyer, Applicant said he understood for the first time that his use and \ncultivation of medical marijuana was disqualifying for national security eligibility. He decided to \nstop, and said he would have done so earlier had he known that using medical marijuana is \ndisqualifying for national security eligibility. In January 2023, Applicant consulted both Dr. H and \nhis marijuana pharmacist before stopping his medical marijuana use. He was not diagnosed with \nmarijuana use disorder. His medical marijuana pharmacist provided guidance on tapering and \nsafely stopping marijuana use in about a two-week period. He declined his pharmacist\u2019s suggestion \nthat he manage his symptoms by switching to cannabidiol during and after tapering off medical \nmarijuana. About one month after receiving the SOR, he destroyed his marijuana cultivation \ngarden. He allowed his medical marijuana certificate to expire and informed his friends and \nacquaintances that he stopped using medical marijuana and could no longer be around it. He last \nused medical marijuana on February 1, 2023. \nIn March 2023, he signed a statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug involvement \nand substance misuse, with an understanding that any future involvement would be grounds for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrevocation of national security eligibility.

Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. When a \njudge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or \ncapricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; \nit does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an \nimportant aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the \nrecord evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless? (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds? and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to properly apply the Guideline H \nmitigating conditions and the Whole-Person Concept. For the following reasons, we affirm the \nJudge\u2019s decision. \nGuideline H: First Allegation \nApplicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s adverse finding under the first allegation \u2013 that he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from 1993 to at least March 2022 \u2013 was arbitrary and capricious \nfor three reasons. First, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to consider the Security Executive \nAgent\u2019s Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of \nPersons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (Dec. 2021) [hereinafter Clarifying Guidance], which notes, \u201cparticularly in \nresponse to the increase in the number of state and local governments legalizing or decriminalizing \nuses of marijuana,\u201d that \u201cprior recreational marijuana use by an individual may be relevant to \nadjudications but not determinative.\u201d Clarifying Guidance at 1-2.

Applicant\u2019s second argument asserts that the Judge \nfailed to consider the frequency of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and surrounding circumstances to \ninclude long periods of abstinence during his 29 years of marijuana use. \nWhen applying the Whole-Person Concept, the judge should examine the \u201cnature, extent, \nand seriousness\u201d among the factors to weigh in assessing the relevance of any disqualifying and \nmitigating conduct. To that end, the evolving landscape of marijuana law in the United States is \none factor that may be considered by the judge when relevant. Here, the Judge explicitly \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s mistaken \u201cbelief that he could continue using medical marijuana as \nprescribed by his pharmaceutical advisor, consistent with the laws in S1\u201d and that Applicant used \nmarijuana in jurisdictions that decriminalized or legalized it. Decision at 9-10. However, when she \nlooked at the nature of his marijuana use to include recreational use and medicinal use, and the \nextent of his marijuana use \u2013 over 29 years including \u201cperiods of time Applicant used and stopped \nusing marijuana, regardless of its illegality\u201d \u2013 the Judge determined that the disqualifying concerns \nwere of such significance that they were not mitigated. Id. at 10 \u201cUnless a Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nrecord evidence is patently absurd, clearly illogical, or obviously unreasonable, the appealing party \nmust present a cogent reason or argument as to how or why the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record \nevidence is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. \n14, 2005). We conclude that the Judge took into consideration all aspects of the record evidence, \nwhich is what the Whole-Person analysis and Clarifying Guidance require. \nApplicant\u2019s third argument asserts that the Judge\u2019s discussion of Applicant\u2019s prescription \nopioid use was arbitrary and capricious because \u201cit is unclear from the Decision why these facts \nwere relevant beyond general background or whether they were weighed as aggravating or \nmitigating.\u201d Appeal Brief at 17. The Judge\u2019s inclusion of the prescription opioid use in her analysis \nwas relevant to the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. \u201cIt is not arbitrary or \ncapricious for a Judge to consider record evidence to make findings of fact about the circumstances \nsurrounding events that are the focus of SOR allegations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 4 (App. Bd. \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c). In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the following factors should be considered: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the mid-1980s, was \ngranted her first security clearance shortly thereafter, and has been with her current employer since \n2014. The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for tax \nyears (TYs) 2018 through 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that she carried delinquent debt totaling \napproximately $117,000 across 10 credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.k). In her answer to the SOR \n(Answer), Applicant admitted all allegations, with explanations. \nDelinquent Credit Card Debt \nBetween 2014 and 2019, Applicant amassed over $117,000 in delinquent credit card debt. \nThroughout the clearance adjudication process, Applicant attributed this delinquent debt to a failed \n2014 business venture\u2014specifically, a contract that was purportedly awarded to her consulting \nbusiness but then rescinded. Applicant first proffered this explanation in two separate security \nclearance applications and then reiterated the same basic story in her background interview, her \nresponse to Government interrogatories, her Answer, and her initial testimony at hearing. At each \nof those junctures, Applicant asserted or implied that the significant credit card debt resulted \ndirectly from spending money in anticipation of beginning work on the contract (e.g., renting office \nspace and hiring employees). \nUnder examination at hearing, however, Applicant equivocated and wavered. She could \nnot identify what business expenses\u2014if any\u2014she incurred in her failed 2014 venture, and the \nJudge ultimately concluded that \u201cApplicant did not actually incur any additional expenses as a \ndirect result of preparing for an anticipated contract or due to the failure to gain the contract.\u201d \nDecision at 18. After that explanation for her credit card debts failed at hearing, Applicant was \n\u201cunable or unwilling to provide a plausible explanation for how she incurred the debts.\u201d Id. Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted a statement to account for some of the funds, but the Judge concluded \nthat \u201c[e]ven if these previously unmentioned expenses are accurate,\u201d they only accounted for \napproximately $39,000 of the total $117,000 debt, leaving unexplained how she spent the \nremaining $78,000. Id. \nIn reviewing the current status of the ten delinquent accounts, the Judge acknowledged \nthat Applicant had resolved three accounts and had established payment plans for six others. With \nthe exception of an unresolved lien that resulted from the remaining alleged debt, the Judge found \nthat Applicant was current on all her ongoing financial obligations. Id. Nevertheless, the Judge \nconcluded that none of the mitigating conditions applied: \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. She still \nowes $64,897 on the SOR debts. She shifted from making false \nassertions about how she incurred such significant credit-card [] \ndebt [to] being evasive in her responses regarding the debt. She only \naddressed two debts before receiving the SOR and in both cases her \nactions were in response to the creditors\u2019 initiatives.

[Id. at 19.] \nUnalleged Conduct \nAlthough the SOR did not explicitly allege gambling as a financial security concern, the \nrecord reveals that Applicant\u2019s gambling habits were in issue throughout the adjudication of her \nsecurity clearance. During Applicant\u2019s December 2021 background interview, the investigator \nquestioned Applicant about \u201clarge financial transactions\u201d at a local casino. Applicant \nacknowledged that she occasionally went to the casino and stated that her wins and losses did not \naffect her finances or place her under any financial strain. Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 14-15. In \nNovember 2022, the Government pursued the issue with interrogatories, asking Applicant to verify \nwhether on four specific dates in August 2020 she spent $10,955, $14,965, $12,390, and $22,220 \nrespectively and whether on one of those same dates she redeemed $20,525, all at a named local \ncasino. To each of those five questions, Applicant responded: \u201cPer extensive research, these \nnumbers are calculated \u2018estimates\u2019 and not actual amounts.\u201d Id. at 19-20. The interrogatories also \nasked Applicant to estimate both the number of times she had frequented a casino in the preceding \nfive years and her winnings and losses during that time frame. Applicant responded, \u201c40-50 times. \nEstimated Win/Loss +31,000.\u201d Id. at 20. \nAt hearing, Applicant provided narrative testimony to the Judge after submission of her \ndocuments. Transcript (Tr.) at 17-28. Regarding the four dates in August 2020 detailed in the \ninterrogatories, Applicant disputed that she spent the amounts referenced, which totaled about \n$60,500, and testified that her own records reflected that she spent $800. Id. at 19-21. In support \nof this assertion, Applicant submitted a heavily-redacted August 2020 bank statement showing \nATM withdrawals at the local casino totaling about $800 on the dates in issue. Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) L. Under cross-examination, Applicant reiterated her interrogatory response that she visited \ncasinos approximately 40 to 50 times during the 2015 to 2019 timeframe and that her winning and \nlosses were \u201cplus $31,000.\u201d Tr. at 99. \nIn a statement submitted after the hearing, Applicant asserted that she has \u201cno gambling \ndebts, loans or problem\u201d and again challenged the Government\u2019s questions regarding her gambling \nin August 2020, stating that the amounts referenced were inaccurate because \u201ca person\u2019s invested \namount cannot be determined and there is no assurance/proof this activity was accumulated by the \nactual person reported.\u201d AE W. \nPost-hearing, the Government submitted records from the local casino\u2019s parent company. \nThe detailed records covered the period from 2015 to 2022 and reflected Applicant\u2019s gambling \nactivity both at the local casino and at two out-of-state casinos owned by the same company. A \nsummary of the most pertinent data includes: \n\u2022 Between August 2015 and August 2022, Applicant inserted $244,416 into \ngaming devices at three separate casinos owned by the same parent company \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand cashed out $28,225, for apparent losses of $216,161. GE 10-13. \n\u2022 Looking specifically at the five-year period queried in the Government\u2019s \ninterrogatories, Applicant gambled at the casinos on 154 occasions, during \nwhich she inserted $196,561 into gaming devices and cashed out $26,925, for \napparent losses of $169,636. Id. \n\u2022 Looking specifically at the days in August 2020 that were at issue in her \ninterview, the interrogatories, and at hearing, Applicant gambled daily from \nAugust 19 through August 25, 2020, with the exception of August 22,2020. \nContrary to her testimony that she played a total of $800 during those dates, \nApplicant inserted a total of $76,775 into gaming devices and cashed out \n$20,525. GE 10. \nThe Judge noted that the gambling conduct was not alleged and that she would consider this non-\nalleged conduct only for the limited purposes permitted under Appeal Board precedent. Decision \nat 19 (citing ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). \nDiscussion \nErrors in Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s counsel asserts that the Judge erred both in her findings of fact, \nmaking \u201cfactual determinations which were wholly inaccurate and are not supported by the \nrecord,\u201d and in her conclusions of law. Appeal Brief at 9. For both assertions, Counsel states that \n\u201c[t]hese errors are delineated at [D], infra.\u201d Id. They are not. Paragraph [D] concerns a different \ntopic altogether and contains no arguments about either findings of fact or conclusions of law. Our \nreview of the 56-page brief reveals no discussion elsewhere of erroneous findings or conclusions. \nA fundamental requirement of the Directive is that the \u201cappeal brief must state the specific issue \nor issues being raised and cite specific portions of the case record supporting any alleged error.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.30. These first two assignments of error fail to meet the minimum requirement \nfor our review, and we decline to consider them further. \nGovernment\u2019s Failure to Meet Burden of Proof \nNext, Applicant\u2019s counsel challenges whether the Government met its burden of proof. In \nmaking this argument, counsel focuses on the fact that Applicant was asked questions in \nGovernment interrogatories and at hearing regarding her gambling activities of August 2020 \nwithout being provided any records detailing those transactions. Counsel characterizes these \nrecords as \u201cthe evidence constituting the Government case.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. This argument is \nfallacious in at least three regards. First, gambling was not alleged, and the Government met its \nburden of proof on the ten alleged delinquent debts and the alleged failure to file income tax returns \nwhen Applicant admitted to all allegations in her Answer. Those admissions are buttressed, as the \nJudge noted, by the five credit reports submitted by the Government. Decision at 2; GE 3-6, 8. \nSecond, and as the Judge explained at hearing, the Government was required only to have a good-\nfaith basis for its questions about Applicant\u2019s gambling activities and was not required to produce \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe underlying documents. Tr. at 78-79. Third, the Government obtained casino records post-\nhearing that detailed Applicant\u2019s gambling history, and those documents were admitted without \nobjection from Applicant. GE 10-13; Decision at 2. To the extent that counsel is complaining that \nproof of the gambling activity was not introduced into evidence, that complaint was certainly \naddressed by the Government\u2019s post-hearing submission. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that the Government carried its burden of proof is well-supported by the record. \nDue Process and Credibility Assessment \nFinally, counsel argues that the Judge failed to advise Applicant properly on her \u201crole\u201d as \na pro se applicant and that the Judge\u2019s credibility determination was flawed as a consequence \nbecause \u201cthe necessary questions were not asked.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. We turn first to counsel\u2019s \nargument that the Judge failed to properly advise Applicant on the hearing process, which is \nfundamentally a due process claim. Counsel argues repeatedly that the Judge\u2019s \u201cread-in\u201d was \ninadequate and that Applicant did not understand that \u201cshe had to present questions on her own \nbehalf, rather than rely simply on what Department Counsel or the Judge asked.\u201d Id. The record, \nhowever, confirms that Applicant received repeated notice of her rights and responsibilities at the \nhearing, that she had ample opportunity to seek clarification of any concerns she might have had, \nand that she availed herself of her rights at the hearing. \nFirst, Applicant received a copy of the Directive along with the SOR and was therein \ninformed of the \u201copportunity to present evidence on his or her own behalf, or to be represented by \ncounsel or personal representative.\u201d Directive \u00b6 4.3.4. Second, when the Government provided \nApplicant with copies of its proposed hearing exhibits, Applicant was also provided with \nconsiderable information about the hearing, directed to the Additional Procedural Guidance for \nfurther information, and specifically informed, inter alia, of her opportunity to make opening and \nclosing statements and to present documentary evidence or witness testimony. Finally, at the \nbeginning of the hearing, the Judge addressed many of the hearing\u2019s procedural aspects. Tr. at 7\u00ad\n11. \nCounsel\u2019s brief ignores these multiple instances of notice, as well as the continuing \ndialogue throughout the hearing in which the Judge explained various aspects of the process. Id. \nat 15-16 (confirming Applicant\u2019s receipt of Government Exhibits and inquiring into any \nobjections); id. at 16-17 (explaining options regarding presenting testimony and documentary \nevidence); id. at 23 (explaining that she will keep the record open for submission of additional \ndocuments and offering opportunity to continue narrative testimony); id. at 77-79 (answering \nApplicant\u2019s question about gambling records that had not been introduced into evidence); id. at \n120-121 (explaining closing statement); id. at 131-132 (explaining final opportunity to augment \nher case and leaving record open for a month). \nAlthough applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take \ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights and interests under the Directive. E.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 00-0593 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001). There is a rebuttable presumption that applicants, as \nadults, are legally competent and capable of making rational decisions concerning their hearings. \nISCR Case No. 01-20579 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004). This would include, at a minimum, the \ncapacity to inform the Judge of any concerns or confusion.

Nor was there anything in Applicant\u2019s conduct during the \nhearing that would give rise to an inference that she was confused about her \u201crole.\u201d Rather, she \nactively participated in the hearing, submitting 16 exhibits (AEs A-P), testifying on her own behalf, \nmaking an opening statement and a closing argument, and presenting substantial post-hearing \ndocumentary evidence (AEs Q-DD). In summary, the record confirms that Applicant received all \nprocess due under the Directive and that counsel\u2019s argument to the contrary is baseless. \nIn a related argument, counsel avers that the Judge could not properly assess Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility because Applicant was not adequately on notice that she needed to present her own case \nrather than simply respond to questions by the Judge and the Government and therefore did not \npresent all necessary testimony. As detailed above, we conclude that Applicant was properly \nadvised of her rights and responsibilities at the hearing. Moreover, based on our review of the \nrecord and decision, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility assessment. \nThe Directive requires the Appeal Board to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Upon her review of the evidence in this case\u2014to include \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing\u2014the Judge made several conclusions that reflected adversely \non Applicant\u2019s credibility. Regarding the delinquent credit card debt, the Judge concluded that \nApplicant \u201chas lied, misled, and equivocated about how she incurred the SOR debts from her 2020 \n[SCA] through her post-hearing submissions.\u201d Decision at 20. Additionally, the Judge noted that \nshe was considering Applicant\u2019s lack of candor on her gambling habits in assessing her credibility, \nwhich is a permissible use of non-alleged conduct. The Judge highlighted that Applicant was put \non notice of security concerns raised by her gambling in the December 2021 background interview \nand again in the November 2022 interrogatories, that \u201c[h]er position in her responses to the \ninterrogatories, her testimony, and her post-hearing statement was to deny conduct that the \nGovernment had not proved,\u201d and that the Government\u2019s post-hearing submission made clear that \nApplicant \u201cwas not being candid and forthcoming about her gambling practices.\u201d Id. at 19-20. \nThose credibility determinations are well within the Judge\u2019s authority and well supported by the \nevidence of record.1 On appeal, a party challenging the resulting credibility determination has a \nheavy burden of persuasion, and Applicant\u2019s challenge to the Judge\u2019s negative assessment of her \ncredibility is not sufficient to meet her heavy burden. E.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jul. 14, 2005). \n1 The Judge erred, however, in concluding that Applicant lied in her response to interrogatories and her Answer \nregarding the filing dates for the delinquent federal income tax returns alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s \nfinding, the tax account transcripts confirm that Applicant responded truthfully in both documents in stating that her \ndelinquent tax returns had been filed. We conclude, however, that the error is harmless, in that it did not likely affect \nthe outcome of the case. E.g., ISCR Case No. 03-23829 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2007). In arriving at her adverse \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility, the Judge relied primarily on Applicant\u2019s lack of candor throughout the security \nclearance process about both her debts\u2014the gravamen of the case\u2014and her gambling. We conclude, therefore, that \nthe Judge\u2019s error about the filing date of delinquent tax returns did not likely affect her ultimate adverse determination. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHearing Office Cases \nIn his brief, Applicant\u2019s counsel cites to and summarizes 62 hearing-level decisions in prior \nGuideline F cases. Appeal Brief at 18-51. Counsel\u2019s reliance on hearing-level decisions is \nmisplaced because each case must be judged on its own merits. AG \u00b6 2(b). As the Board has \nfrequently stated, how particular facts scenarios were decided at the hearing level in other cases is \ngenerally not a relevant consideration in our review of a case. Only in rare situations - such as \nseparate cases involving spouses, cohabitants, or partners in which the debts and the financial \ncircumstances surrounding them are the same - would the adjudication outcome in another case \nhave any meaningful relevance in our review of a case. The 62 Hearing Office decisions that \nApplicant\u2019s counsel recites have no direct relationship or unique link to Applicant\u2019s case that \nwould make them relevant here. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has failed to identify any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of \nthis case or in her decision. The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant \ndata and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant received citations related to operating \na vehicle with an expired registration in 2012 and speeding in 2018, and that he was arrested for a \nvariety of other offenses, including theft by check in 2003, felony unauthorized use of a vehicle in \n2008, assault of a family member in 2013, and driving while intoxicated or impaired (DWI) in \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2005, 2012, and 2021. All criminal concerns were cross-alleged under Guideline E and the alcohol-\nrelated charges were also cross-alleged under Guideline G. Finally, under Guideline F, the SOR \nalleged that Applicant carried delinquent consumer and mortgage debt totaling approximately \n$44,000. In response to the SOR, Applicant denied the 2005 and 2021 DWIs and the 2013 assault \ncharge as alleged under Guideline J. He admitted all other allegations.  \nThe Judge favorably resolved the Guideline E and Guideline G cases, but he ruled \nadversely on all Guideline J and Guideline F allegations. Citing Applicant\u2019s \u201cextensive history of \ncriminal violations\u201d and that he was awaiting a court date for driving a vehicle without insurance \nin December 2024, the Judge opined that the more recent infraction \u201ctends to show that [Applicant] \nstill does not comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d and found insufficient evidence that \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior is unlikely to recur or has been successfully rehabilitated. Decision \nat 7. Regarding the financial concerns, the Judge acknowledged that Applicant had resolved his \nmortgage debt, was working to resolve three SOR debts and two additional debts not alleged in \nthe SOR, and commended Applicant\u2019s hiring of a debt consolidation company to assist in those \nefforts. The Judge went on, however, to find that the resolution efforts began after the SOR was \nissued, which \u201cdetracts from his ability to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances \nor in good faith,\u201d and that at least three SOR debts remained unaddressed. Id. at 10. \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nclaims of error with specificity. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30. On appeal, Applicant raises no claim of \nharmful error by the Judge. Instead, he seeks reconsideration of his case, reiterating his \nexplanations for his criminal conduct and delinquent debts, and stating his intentions for \naddressing and avoiding both in the future. He also provides new evidence regarding the outcomes \nof several of the criminal charges, the status of his mortgage account and other debts, and his \ncompletion of an outpatient substance abuse treatment program. The Appeal Board does not \nreview cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.29. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal also requests conditional security eligibility. Appendix C of SEAD 4 \nprovides authority to grant conditional security eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue \ninformation that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d Applicant did not request conditional \neligibility at hearing and nothing in the record supports a conclusion that the Judge erred in not \ngranting it. Moreover, although Appendix C provides authority to grant conditional security \neligibility,1 our review of this case reflects no evidence of proposed additional security measures \nor the efficacy thereof in the record below. Accordingly, Applicant has not established that the \ngranting of an exception under Appendix C is merited. \n1 DIR. FOR DEF. INT.

For the reasons detailed below, we conclude that the Judge erred in adopting Applicant\u2019s narrative, rendering her decision arbitrary and capricious and mandating reversal. While the Board is required to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determination, that deference has its limits. The Board must consider whether a judge\u2019s acceptance of an applicant\u2019s explanation for his conduct is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. As we have previously held, when the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility (e.g., contradictory evidence, inconsistent statements), the judge should address that 7 aspect of the record explicitly, explaining why she found the applicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief. Failure to do so suggests that the judge simply substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence. E.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01450 at 9 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2022).

Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged five \nconcerns: that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2006 to September \n2011; that he used marijuana after being granted access to classified information in 2007; that \nmarijuana was found in his vehicle during the 2011 DWI arrest; that Applicant tested positive for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana on a urinalysis test administered in August 2011; and that cocaine was found in \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle during the 2020 arrest. The alcohol and drug allegations were cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E. Under Guideline E, the SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified material facts \non five security clearance applications (SCAs) and during two personal subject interviews (PSIs), \nfor a total of 13 falsification allegations. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on all \nallegations, concluding that Applicant mitigated the Guideline G and H security concerns (as well \nas the cross-alleged Guideline E concerns), and that the Government failed to establish a prima \nfacie case for the 13 falsification allegations. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nThe allegations under Guideline G and H arise from three DWI arrests over the course of \n18 years and events that flowed from those arrests, as described in pertinent part below. \nGuidelines G and H \nIn September 2002, on the night of the first incident, Applicant was pulled over for speeding \nafter drinking at a bar. A breathalyzer test indicated a blood alcohol content (BAC) level of 0.10, \nand Applicant was arrested and charged. On the advice of his attorney, Applicant voluntarily \nenrolled in two alcohol-related education programs, one of which was the Virginia Alcohol Safety \nAction Program (ASAP). Under a plea agreement, Applicant was found guilty of Petty Driving \nUnder the Influence (DUI) and sentenced to one year of probation and one year of restricted \nlicense. During his first background investigation in 2006, Applicant was asked about the incident and \nrepresented that he no longer drove after drinking. \nIn August 2011, Applicant had a second traffic incident, which led to several of the \nallegations in issue. By this time, Applicant had held a security clearance for about four years \nwhile working as a federal contractor. On the night in issue, Applicant attended his own bachelor \nparty, at which he admittedly drank alcohol and smoked marijuana before driving home. Pulled over \nfor speeding, Applicant failed a field sobriety test, and a breathalyzer test indicated a BAC of 0.10. \nWhile searching Applicant\u2019s car, police found a small bag of marijuana on the passenger side. \nApplicant told the officer that he had people in his car earlier that night and contended that they \nmust have left the baggie. At hearing, Applicant admitted that he was uncertain whether anyone \nelse was in his car that evening but remained adamant that someone else left the bag in the car. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DWI and Possession of Marijuana. As part of his \nplea negotiations, Applicant was given a choice to be charged with possession of marijuana or to \nhave an interlock system installed in his car. Applicant chose to have the interlock system installed, \nand the drug charge was dropped. After pleading guilty to DWI, Applicant was sentenced to a year \nof probation and a year of driving with an interlock system. \nApplicant enrolled in Virginia ASAP in August 2011, shortly after his arrest. During the \nbackground investigation for Applicant\u2019s 2018 SCA, the investigator obtained Applicant\u2019s ASAP \nrecords, which revealed that Applicant tested positive for marijuana on an intake urinalysis and self\u00ad\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreported marijuana use from 2006 through September 2011. When confronted with this unreported \ninformation during 2019 background interviews, Applicant admitted that he tested positive during \nhis intake urinalysis but claimed he did not recall using marijuana from 2006 forward. Although \nApplicant initially asserted that he only entered ASAP for alcohol use, he later admitted that he \nwas required to attend the drug programming within ASAP as well because of his positive \nurinalysis upon intake. Government Exhibit (GE) 6 at 42\u201343, 45. At hearing, Applicant testified \nthat the ASAP records were \u201chearsay\u201d and incorrect, that he never self-reported using marijuana from \n2006 to 2011, and that his use at his bachelor party \u201cwas [his] first time ever smoking it\u201d as an adult. \nTranscript (Tr.) at 41. \nIn November 2020, Applicant had a third traffic incident, which again led to alcohol and drug \ncharges. According to Applicant, a friend visited him and brought him one high-alcohol-content \nbeer. When Applicant subsequently attempted to drive to the gas station, police pulled him over \nfor speeding or swerving. During a search of Applicant\u2019s car, police found empty alcoholic seltzer \nand beer cans in either the trunk or backseat, a small baggie with a white powder residue on the \ndriver\u2019s side door, and a marijuana grinder in the back seat. The police also found a straw with powder \nresidue on Applicant\u2019s person. Applicant told the officer that the cans were left by friends he had in \nhis car a few weeks prior and that the baggie did not belong to him. He initially stated that he did \nnot know the baggie was there but subsequently acknowledged he saw it in the car a few days \nearlier. He asserted that he thought the baggie contained screws and had no idea it contained drugs. \nApplicant submitted to a breathalyzer test, which indicated a BAC of 0.15, and a second \ntest at the police station showed a BAC of 0.12. Applicant was arrested and charged with \nmisdemeanor DWI, 2nd offense within 5-10 years, and Possession of Schedule I or Schedule II \ncontrolled substance. Applicant pleaded guilty to DWI and was sentenced to 90 days in jail (85 \ndays suspended), ASAP attendance, unsupervised probation until March 2024, a restricted license \nuntil March 2024, and installation of an interlock system. The charge for possession of a Schedule \nI or II controlled substance was disposed of by nolle prosequi. Applicant served his five-day jail \nsentence in March 2021 and attended Virginia ASAP from June 2021 to August 2021. \nAt the hearing, Applicant reaffirmed his earlier claim that he did not know the baggie was \nin the car prior to being stopped for drunk driving. He asserted that friends must have dropped the \nbaggie at some point in the past. Applicant claimed that he did not know his friends used illegal \ndrugs until this 2020 DWI arrest and that, although his friends never confessed to using drugs, he \nis now confident that two of his friends used them. \nOver the years, Applicant has made various vows to stop drinking or to stop drinking and \ndriving. In August 2006, Applicant told a background investigator that there was no likelihood of \na second DUI because he had stopped driving after drinking alcohol. After his second DUI, \nApplicant asserted in his 2012 SCA that he was abstained from alcohol indefinitely. He reiterated \nthis resolve during his subsequent background interview in July 2012, stating that he had not \nconsumed any alcohol since August 2011 because he had \u201ctoo much to lose.\u201d GE 6 at 51, 52. Since \nhis third and most recent DWI, Applicant has made vague and arguably inconsistent statements \nregarding his current alcohol habits. In a May 2022 counseling session, Applicant reported that he \ndrinks socially on rare occasions but has had no alcohol since his November 2020 DWI arrest. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) F at Enclosure 4a. In his response to interrogatories in February 2023, \nApplicant reported that his five-day jail sentence in March 2021 was a life-changing event, after \nwhich he stopped drinking alcohol. GE 6 at 5. At hearing, Applicant testified both that he stopped \ndrinking the night of his November 2020 DUI and that he had not \u201ctouched a drop of alcohol\u201d \nsince he got his current job, which was in April 2021. Tr. 79, 80. The Judge found as fact that \nApplicant \u201chas not consumed any alcohol since November 2020.\u201d Decision at 5. \nIn her Guideline G analysis, the Judge adopted Applicant\u2019s representations that he \nreduced or ceased his alcohol consumption after each DWI, that he did not regularly consume \nany alcohol between his mother\u2019s death in November 2018 and his DWI arrest in November \n2020, and \u2014 as discussed above \u2014 that he has not consumed any alcohol since that arrest. The \nJudge relied on the passage of time since the last DWI in November 2020 and Applicant\u2019s stated \nabstinence in concluding that \u201cApplicant\u2019s past alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur.\u201d Id. at 13. \nIn her Guideline H analysis, the Judge again accepted Applicant\u2019s version of events \u2014 that \nhe first tried marijuana experimentally while in high school; that he used marijuana twice in \ncollege with his last use in 2003; that his only use of an illegal substance as an adult was a single \npuff on a marijuana joint at his bachelor party in 2011; and that this single puff apparently resulted \nin his positive intake urinalysis at ASAP. Acknowledging that his use of marijuana while holding \na security clearance \u201cplaces a heavy burden on Applicant,\u201d the Judge nevertheless found that \nApplicant had mitigated the alleged concerns, highlighting \u201cthe circumstances surrounding his \none-time use of marijuana, the length of time that has passed since that single use, and his remorse \nfor his actions.\u201d Id. at 15 (emphasis added). In concluding that there was insufficient evidence of \ncocaine possession, the Judge relied on Applicant\u2019s denials and the fact that the 2020 possession \ncharge was nolle prossed. \nGuideline E \nApplicant completed five SCAs: in 2006, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2022. The SOR alleged \nthat Applicant falsified those five SCAs and two related PSIs by omitting material facts about \nthe alcohol and drug incidents described above, for a total of 13 falsifications.1 We have listed \nbelow the pertinent SCAs and PSIs, what Applicant disclosed about his alcohol and drug \nincidents, and what he failed to disclose as alleged in the SOR. \nFebruary 2006 SCA \nFailed to disclose September 2002 DUI arrest and conviction (SOR \u00b6 3.o). \nJune 2012 SCA \nDisclosed 2002 and 2011 DUI arrests and convictions and referenced marijuana in car at \n1 The alcohol and drug concerns described above were cross-alleged under Guideline E, and the Judge found them \nmitigated for the same reasons that she applied under Guideline G and H. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntime of 2011 arrest; \nFailed to disclose marijuana use from about 2006 to September 2011 (SOR \u00b6 3.m); and \nFailed to disclose marijuana use after being granted access to classified information in \nSeptember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.n). \nSeptember 2015 SCA \nDisclosed 2011 DUI and ASAP; \nFailed to disclose marijuana use from about 2006 to September 2011 (SOR \u00b6 3. k); and \nFailed to disclose that he used marijuana after being granted access to classified \ninformation in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.l). \nMarch 2018 SCA \nIn Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs), referenced 2011 arrest for DUI and marijuana and \n2011 voluntary enrollment in drug counseling; \nIn Section 22 (Police Record), failed to disclose 2002 and 2011 arrests and convictions for \nDUI/DWI (SOR \u00b6 3.g); \nFailed to disclose marijuana use from about 2006 to September 2011 (SOR \u00b6 3. h); and \nFailed to disclose marijuana use after being granted access to classified information in \nSeptember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.i). \nSeptember 2018 PSI \nDenied having used illegal drugs in the last seven years, including while having access to \nclassified information (SOR \u00b6 3.j). \nJuly 2022 SCA \n\u201c2nd\nDisclosed 2020 arrest for \nDUI within 10 years\u201d and possession of controlled \nsubstance; \nFailed to disclose 2002 and 2011 arrests and convictions for DUI/DWI (SOR \u00b6 3.c); and \nFailed to disclose marijuana use from 2006 through 2011, including after being granted \naccess to classified information in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 3.d). \nSeptember 2022 PSI \nDenied having ever tested positive on a drug test, failing to disclose that he tested positive \nfor marijuana on the ASAP urinalysis in about August 2011 (SOR \u00b6 3.e); and \nDenied any use of illegal drugs in last seven years, failing to disclose use of cocaine around \nthe time of November 2020 arrest (SOR \u00b6 3.f). \nIn the Judge\u2019s analysis, she highlighted that Applicant\u2019s primary explanation for his failure \nto disclose his reportable incidents was that \u201che believed that once he disclosed the information, it \nwas known to the Government and it was not necessary to disclose the information again.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecision at 17. She noted that this explanation was buttressed by the fact that Applicant failed in \nsome instances to disclose information that he had disclosed on earlier SCAs. The Judge also noted \nthat Applicant was confused by the wording of the SCAs. Specifically, she noted, Applicant \nunderstood the use of the term \u201cother than previously listed\u201d as used in Sections 22 and 23 to mean \nthat if the requested information at been previously listed on any SCA, he did not have to list it \nagain. Additionally, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s assertions that he rushed through the forms \nand did not pay enough attention was supported by the record, as the SCAs contained errors: \u201cHe \ndisclosed reportable information in the wrong sections and omitted information where he should \nhave included it on his 2012 and 2018 [SCAs].\u201d Id. at 18. \nThe Judge acknowledged that this explanation of confusion and carelessness did not \naddress all the alleged Guideline E concerns. She noted that Applicant intentionally failed to \ndisclose his 2002 DWI on his 2006 SCA but highlighted that he did so on the advice of his attorney \nand because he was not convicted of a DWI. (Applicant was instead convicted of \u201cPetty DUI.\u201d) \nThe Judge also acknowledged Applicant\u2019s failure at several junctures to disclose his marijuana \nuse: \nApplicant did not disclose his 2011 one-time marijuana use as required on \nhis June 2012, September 2015, or March 2018 [SCAs], or during his September \n2018 PSI as required. He did not disclose this information until March 2019 in a \nfollow-up PSI when he was confronted by the investigator about testing positive \nfor marijuana one time in 2011. Applicant described the circumstances of his use, \nincluding the stupidity of his conduct, and stated that his failure to disclose it was \nan oversight and that the incident had slipped his mind. He has consistently denied \nthat he has ever intentionally falsified information during any of his background \ninvestigations. \nId. In the quoted paragraph, the Judge neglected to include that Applicant also omitted the \nmarijuana use and positive urinalysis on his most recent SCA in July 2022. She did, however, \naddress Applicant\u2019s denial of marijuana use and any positive urinalysis during his subsequent \nSeptember 2022 PSI, finding that \u201che thought given the context of the investigator\u2019s questions that \nthe investigator asked him if he had failed any drug tests in the last seven years, not if he had ever \n[failed] a drug test.\u201d Id. at 17. In summary, the Judge concluded her Guideline E analysis as \nfollows: \nGiven the record evidence as a whole, particularly the consistent difficulties \nthat Applicant has had in properly disclosing information during his background \ninvestigations, I find that Applicant\u2019s omissions during his background \ninvestigations were unintentional. There is nothing in the record that suggests he \nhas not disclosed all of the information that the Government has sought from him \nsince 2019. He just did not disclose it correctly. Since I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nalleged falsifications were not deliberate, either on any of his [SCAs] or during his \nbackground interviews, neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) or 16(b) applies to any of the \nfalsification allegations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nId. at 18. Although she concluded that the Government did not establish a prima facie case, the Judge \nalternatively found the Guideline E concerns mitigated after a brief paragraph in which she cited to \n\u201csteps to rectify his lack of understanding of how to properly complete an [SCA] and respond to \nquestions during a PSI,\u201d his abstinence, and his disassociation from the people he previously used \nmarijuana with. Id. at 18\u201319. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOn appeal, the Government challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Government failed \nto establish a prima facie case under Guideline E, her mitigation analyses under Guidelines G, H, \nand E, and her application of the Whole-Person Concept. When a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions \nare challenged, we must determine whether they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or capricious if: it does not examine \nrelevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant \nfactors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it \noffers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so \nimplausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, \n1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nThe Judge\u2019s Credibility Determination \nAlthough the Government challenges many aspects of the Judge\u2019s decision, the central \nissue raised by the appeal is the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination of Applicant \u2014 that \nthe Judge believed and relied upon Applicant\u2019s version of events about his DUIs, his drug history, \nand his omissions on SCAs and during PSIs. That favorable determination pervaded the Judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact as well as her analyses under Guidelines G, H, and E. For the reasons detailed \nbelow, we conclude that the Judge erred in adopting Applicant\u2019s narrative, rendering her decision \narbitrary and capricious and mandating reversal. \nWhile the Board is required to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determination, that \ndeference has its limits. The Board must consider whether a judge\u2019s acceptance of an applicant\u2019s \nexplanation for his conduct is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as \na whole. As we have previously held, when the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility (e.g., contradictory evidence, inconsistent statements), the judge should address that \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naspect of the record explicitly, explaining why she found the applicant\u2019s version of events to be \nworthy of belief. Failure to do so suggests that the judge simply substituted a favorable impression \nof an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence. E.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01450 at 9 (App. Bd. Jun. \n9, 2022). A credibility determination may be set aside or reversed if it is unreasonable, contradicts \nother findings, is based on an inadequate reason, is patently without basis in the record, or is \ninherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact. \u201cWhen a witness\u2019s story is contradicted \nby other evidence or is so internally inconsistent or implausible that a reasonable fact finder would \nnot credit it, we can find error despite the deference owed a Judge\u2019s credibility determination.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2012), (citing Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 \nU.S. 564 at 575 (1985)). \nIn accepting Applicant\u2019s version of events, the Judge failed to consider the inherent \nimplausibility of Applicant\u2019s narrative and the significant evidence that contradicted his version. \nLooking first at the Guideline G case, the Judge unquestioningly accepted Applicant\u2019s assertions, \nto include: that he seldom drank alcohol after his 2002 DUI; that he \u201cdid not regularly consume \nalcohol\u201d between 2009 and 2017, although he was arrested and convicted of his second DUI in \n2011; that he drank no alcohol between November 2018 and November 2020; that he was pulled \nover for DUI on the first occasion that he drank alcohol; and that he has consumed no alcohol since \nthat November 2020 arrest for DUI. Decision at 3, 4. \nTo highlight just a few aspects of this improbable narrative, the Judge chose to believe that \nApplicant consumed no alcohol beginning in November 2018, drank one 16-ounce high-alcohol \nbeer in November 2020, promptly got pulled over for a third DUI, registering a BAC of .15, and \nhas consumed no alcohol since. The Judge never mentioned \u2014 much less weighed \u2014 the sheer \nimprobability, bad luck, and implausibility of this story. The evidence that the Judge failed to \nconsider includes: the fact Applicant had empty cans of beer and hard seltzer in his car at the time \nof his 2020 arrest, refuting his assertion that he had not consumed alcohol since 2018; the \nimprobability that Applicant, weighing about 280 lbs., would register a BAC of .15 after one high-\nalcohol-content beer; and Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements about his drinking habits since the \nlast DWI. As to the last factor, the Government highlights that \u201cthe only thing consistent is \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistency\u2015among other things, he has been unable to consistently identify (1) his \ndate of last alcohol usage, (2) the period of time he was abstinent from alcohol following his 2011 \nDUI, or (3) his general history of alcohol use.\u201d Appeal Brief at 26. \nWhen faced with conflicting evidence, a judge is required to assess and resolve the conflicts \nbased upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative reliability, plausibility, and \nultimate truthfulness. See ISCR 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). In her Guideline G \nanalysis, the Judge failed to address and reconcile the significant evidence that contradicted \nApplicant\u2019s narrative. Moreover, in accepting Applicant\u2019s improbable explanation of a limited \ndrinking history punctuated by three DWIs, the Judge treated each DWI as an isolated event and \nfailed to address the obvious pattern of recurring alcohol incidents despite prior avowals not to \ndrink or not to drink and drive. As a related issue, the Judge failed to consider whether a purported \nfour-year period of sobriety was sufficiently mitigating in light of that pattern. The Judge\u2019s \nuncritical acceptance of Applicant\u2019s narrative regarding the Guideline G allegations constituted \nerror. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nTurning to the Guideline H case, the Judge appears to have again adopted unquestioningly \nApplicant\u2019s version of events, to include: that he used marijuana just twice in college with his last \nuse in 2003; that he \u201ctook one hit off a joint\u201d at his bachelor party in August 2011;2 that the \u201cone \nhit\u201d resulted in a positive urinalysis upon his later enrollment in ASAP; that the marijuana found \nin his car in August 2011 during the DUI stop was not his but instead left by friends; that the \nmarijuana grinder found in his car during the 2020 DUI stop was not his but instead left by friends; \nand that the cocaine found in his car during the 2020 DUI stop was also left by friends. \nAgain, to highlight just a few aspects of this improbable narrative, the Judge chose to \nbelieve that Applicant has used marijuana only once in the past 20 years; that he took only \u201cone \npuff\u201d;3 and that this one-time de minimis use resulted in a positive urinalysis upon his subsequent \nenrollment at ASAP. As in her Guideline G analysis, the Judge never considered the utter \nimplausibility of this chain of events. Nor did she explicitly address \u2014 as required \u2014 the \nsignificant evidence to the contrary, to include Applicant\u2019s disclosure to ASAP counselors that he \nused marijuana from 2006 to 2011 and the drugs and paraphernalia found in Applicant\u2019s car during \npolice stops in 2011 and 2020 when he was the sole occupant of the vehicle. \u201cWhen the record \ncontains conflicting evidence, the judge must carefully weigh the evidence in a reasonable, \ncommon sense manner and make findings that reflect a reasonable interpretation of the evidence \nthat takes into account all the record evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0435 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2000). Here, the Judge failed to acknowledge the conflicts, failed to weigh the evidence, and failed \nto make findings that took into account any evidence beyond Applicant\u2019s testimony. In sum, our \nreview of the record convinces us that the Judge unreasonably substituted a favorable impression \nof Applicant for record evidence and failed to examine and consider relevant evidence.  \nGuideline E Allegations and Findings \nHaving determined that the Judge fundamentally erred in her credibility determination, we \nneed not analyze in exhaustive detail the 13 Guideline E allegations, the Judge\u2019s analysis, and the \nGovernment\u2019s challenges on appeal. Regarding the allegations of Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose \nhis DWIs consistently and completely, it bears noting that Applicant filled out five SCAs over a \n16-year period and that he disclosed all of his DWIs (at the time) on one application and some of \nhis DWIs on two other applications. The Judge\u2019s findings about Applicant\u2019s lack of intent are \narguably sustainable on some of the DWI-related allegations. \nThe allegations concerning Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose marijuana use are another matter \nentirely. Applicant tested positive for marijuana in August 2011 while holding a security clearance. \nEven accepting Applicant\u2019s improbable story that he only used marijuana on a single occasion, he \nwas required to disclose the use but never did so \u2014 not on his 2012 SCA, not on his 2015 SCA, \nand not on his 2018 SCA. Confronted by the background investigator after his 2018 SCA \nsubmission, Applicant admitted the positive urinalysis. On his 2022 application, however, \nApplicant again failed to disclose marijuana use while holding a clearance, and, during his \n2 Decision at 3. \n3 GE 6 at 43. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubsequent PSI, Applicant denied ever having failed a urinalysis test. In the face of this record \nevidence, the Judge inexplicably concluded that \u201cApplicant\u2019s omissions during his background \ninvestigations were unintentional\u201d and that the Government had not met its burden, or conversely \nthat the concern was mitigated. Those conclusions ignore important aspects of the case and are not \nsustainable. \nIn August 2011, the following events occurred: Applicant was arrested for DWI and \nmarijuana possession; he entered ASAP for alcohol; he tested positive for marijuana; and he was \nsubsequently required to attend the ASAP drug program as well. Those are memorable events. \nWhen Applicant filled out his June 2012 SCA, the events were recent and fresh in his memory. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation that he forgot the marijuana use when filling out the SCA defies logic and \ncommon sense, as does the Judge\u2019s acceptance of that excuse. His repeated omission of the \nmarijuana use over three subsequent SCAs and his denial of a positive urinalysis during his 2022 \ninterview further support a conclusion that Applicant made the purposeful, intentional decision not \nto disclose that he used marijuana while holding a clearance. The Judge erred in her conclusion \nthat the Government failed to establish its prima facie case for the related SOR allegations (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.d, 3e, 3.h, 3.i, 3.k, 3.l, 3.m, and 3.n) and in her alternative conclusion that Applicant mitigated \nthe concerns. \nConclusion \nThe Judge\u2019s decision in this matter was arbitrary and capricious in that it substituted a \nfavorable credibility determination for record evidence, failed to consider relevant evidence, failed \nto consider important aspects of the case, and offered an explanation for the decision that runs \ncontrary to the record evidence. The Judge\u2019s decision is not sustainable under the Egan standard \nand must be reversed. See ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024) (Reversal is \nappropriate when the Board concludes from the record that a contrary formal finding or overall \ngrant or denial of security clearance eligibility is the clear outcome.). \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe favorable decision in ISCR Case No. 23-00101 is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

On June 30, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of \nthe basis of that decision \u2013 trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective \nJune 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On January 10, \n2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge David M. White denied \nApplicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nApplicant is in his early 40s. Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, \nthat he used hallucinogenic mushrooms from 2008 to at least June 2020, that he had used marijuana \nsince October 2020, and that he intended to continue to use both drugs in the future. The Judge \nfound that Applicant uses marijuana on a weekly basis and intends to continue such use in the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfuture because it helps him relax and sleep. Applicant acknowledged his understanding that, \ndespite recreational marijuana\u2019s legality under his residential state law, it remains illegal under \nfederal law. Regarding his hallucinogenic mushroom use, Applicant submitted a statement of \nintent declaring that he would stop using hallucinogens in the United States but intended to use \nthem during future overseas trips. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged one delinquent lease account, placed for collection for \nabout $25,000. Applicant acknowledged that he cosigned the lease with a friend and that they both \nstopped paying the rent after the friend relocated in 2019, but he denied the allegation on the basis \nthat the debt might be charged off. He has decided to make no effort to resolve the debt, despite \nhaving funds available after his monthly expenses are paid. \nBased on the foregoing, the Judge found that the evidence creates substantial doubt about \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility and held adversely on all allegations. \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nclaims of error with specificity.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 30, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline M \n(Use of Information Technology) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On January 30, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nJudge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 50s and has two adult children. He has worked for various defense \ncontractors during his career as a network engineer, for which his duties include protecting data \nsecurity. Applicant has held a security clearance since 2001 and is currently employed as a senior \nnetwork engineer and information security systems officer. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2018, Applicant\u2019s then-contract employer was replaced by another contract employer, \nand he remained working at the same facility and continued to use the same computer after the \nchange. During a network migration pursuant to the change in contractors, Applicant was notified \nthat content was being diverted from his computer to servers in the People\u2019s Republic of China \nthrough a web browser developed by a Chinese company, which Applicant had installed on his \nwork computer without authorization. Following an investigation into the matter, Applicant was \nterminated from the employment in June 2018. Under Guideline M, the SOR alleged the foregoing \nconduct and termination. \nApplicant admitted installing the browser on his computer while working with his previous \ncontract employer and explained that nothing derogatory was ever flagged. At hearing, in response \nto why he used this relatively obscure unauthorized browser owned by a Chinese company instead \nof an employer-approved mainstream browser, Applicant pointed to personal preferences that \nprovided minor convenience. He provided no other reason for using the unauthorized browser. In \n2022, Applicant was re-hired by the company that terminated him in 2018. \nIn his mitigation analysis, the Judge considered the applicability of AG \u00b6 41(a)1, noting \nfavorably the lack of evidence that Applicant had ever misused information technology before the \nSOR-alleged conduct or since, that the employer that fired him in 2018 rehired him in 2022, and \nthat he is highly respected at his current job. The Judge concluded, however, that \u201c[t]he nature and \nseriousness of Applicant\u2019s misuse of information technology was amplified by the fact that his job \ninvolved data security protection,\u201d which ultimately outweighed the conduct\u2019s \u201cisolated nature and \nthe passage of time that has elapsed since the misuse of information technology.\u201d Decision at 6.2 \nDiscussion \nA judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or capricious if: \u201cit does not examine relevant evidence; \nit fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection \nbetween the facts and the choice made; [it] does not consider relevant factors; [it] reflects a clear \nerror of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for \nthe decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or [it] is so implausible that it cannot be \nascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 95-0600 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) \n(citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that he \u201cprovided evidence to support a favorable ruling to \nkeep [his] clearance\u201d at hearing, but also expresses regret for not having explained his continuous \ntraining and current responsibilities in more detail. Appeal Brief at 1. To the extent that Applicant \nis arguing that his evidence was sufficient to support mitigation and granting his eligibility, he is \nessentially disagreeing with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \n1 AG \u00b6 41(a): so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n2 Under Guideline F, the SOR also alleged various delinquent federal and state tax obligations and a delinquent \nconsumer account. The Judge found favorably on all Guideline F allegations, which are not subject to this appeal. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is no bright-line rule for what constitutes a sufficient period of without recurrence of \npast misconduct to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, and such a determination requires \nreasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant\u2019s case based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record. See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nWhen the record reflects a significant period without subsequent misconduct, the judge must \narticulate a rational basis for concluding why that period is insufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. Id. \nDuring the hearing, the Judge distinguished between unauthorized installation and use by \nsomeone with minimal IT experience and a seasoned IT professional with at least 18 years of \nexperience, such as Applicant. This distinction is reflected in the Judge\u2019s analysis and weighed in \nthe severity ultimately assigned to Applicant\u2019s conduct, as was the fact that Applicant\u2019s conduct \nnot only could have resulted in a security breach, but actually did. Considering those factors \ntogether, the Judge concluded that the intervening six and a half years without similar incident was \ninsufficient to find reform or rehabilitation. We find that this analysis reflects a rational basis for \nconcluding that the passage of time was insufficient to mitigate the security concern and that the \nJudge\u2019s determination that AG \u00b6 41(a) did not apply is sustainable. \nTo the extent that Applicant is suggesting that he was unaware of his responsibility to \npresent mitigating evidence regarding the Guideline M concern, this also does not establish error. \nIn DOHA proceedings, it is the applicant\u2019s duty to present evidence sufficient to mitigate the \nconcerns established by the Government, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion \nfor obtaining a favorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. It is neither the judge\u2019s nor the \nGovernment\u2019s duty to seek additional mitigating evidence or to undertake further investigation of \nthe concerns raised in an SOR. See ISCR Case No. 15-08885 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2017). All \napplicants, including those that are pro se, are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to \nprotect their rights under the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 00-0086 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2000). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal reiterates his explanation for the 2018 incident and \nrequests reconsideration of the decision. Applicant also provides new evidence in the form of two \nprofessional certificates of appreciation and two letters of recommendation. The Appeal Board \ndoes not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the disqualifying and \nmitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is \nsufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n3 \n\nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-00525 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: James B.

The allegations in the SOR \u2013 \nthat he was charged with two counts of Felony Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon \u2013 stem \nfrom what police, the Government, and Applicant described as a road rage incident that escalated \nto the point that Applicant confronted the driver and occupant of another car and drew a weapon. \nAccording to Applicant, the incident began when he was driving his pickup truck in the \nleft lane in heavy traffic behind an SUV that was being driven below the speed limit. Applicant \nmaintained that he was not tailgating the SUV but that the driver of that vehicle, nonetheless, was \n\u201cbrake-checking\u201d him.1 Believing that he could not merge into the adjacent right-hand lane and \npass the SUV, Applicant elected to get around the vehicle by driving down the unpaved median \nstrip and pulling directly in front of it. His rationale for doing so was that he believed \u201cthere\u2019s \nsomething going on.\u201d Transcript (Tr.) at 27. Applicant maintained that his effort to pass the SUV \nby driving down the median was initially thwarted by the driver of that vehicle who attempted to \nprevent him from merging back into the actual driving lane. However, Applicant sped up enough \nto make the merge. \nHaving successfully passed the SUV, Applicant nonetheless stopped his truck and exited \nit to confront the driver rather than continue driving with the flow of slow-moving traffic or \nchanging lanes. Applicant\u2019s explanation for doing this was that he believed he would be shot \nthrough the window of his truck had he stayed in it. Tr. at 24, 52. Applicant further explained that \nhe stopped his truck and got out because the occupants might \u201cthink I\u2019m somebody I\u2019m not because \nI didn\u2019t do anything to them\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve got to figure this out.\u201d Tr. at 28, 48. \nAfter Applicant exited his truck, the female driver of the SUV and her male passenger \nexited their vehicle. Applicant approached them yelling, \u201cWhat in the living F. What are you \ndoing?\u201d or something along those lines. Tr. at 55; Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 3. Applicant then \nbecame involved in an altercation with the male passenger and was punched in the face. He claims \nthis was unprovoked although the passenger, driver, and an eye-witness claim that Applicant threw \nthe first punch but missed. Applicant returned to his truck, retrieved a handgun that was on the \nconsole and brandished it in the direction of the occupants of the SUV with his finger on the trigger. \nAt that point, the SUV left the scene and the police were notified. \nAfter police responded, Applicant, the occupants of the SUV, and other individuals who \nhad witnessed the events were stopped and interviewed. Although Applicant claimed to have been \nonly briefly interviewed, he was questioned at the scene repeatedly before asserting his 5th \nAmendment rights. When first interviewed by a police lieutenant and a deputy sheriff, Applicant \nclaimed to have been struck by an unknown vehicle. The officers, however, concluded he had been \ninvolved in a road-rage incident. In a subsequent interview with the lieutenant, Applicant stated \nthat he and the driver of the SUV were driving aggressively and that he eventually ended up in \nfront of the SUV. He further stated that he got out of his truck, confronted the occupants of the \nSUV, and was \u201cclocked\u201d from behind. In a final interview conducted by the lieutenant and two \n1 Applicant refers to brake-checking as the act of a vehicle applying brakes when not necessary. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeputy sheriffs, Applicant was confronted by what the witnesses told the officers and he admitted \nto retrieving his weapon from his truck but denied that he pointed it at the occupants of the SUV. \nHe gave the officers permission to retrieve the gun from his truck and, after a loaded 9mm handgun \nwas removed from Applicant\u2019s vehicle, he was placed under arrest. GE 3 at 4-7. During \nquestioning, Applicant did not raise self-defense as an explanation for his role in this incident. \nThe occupants of the SUV and four other eyewitnesses also provided statements to the \npolice. Although at hearing Applicant disputed some of the details of their statements, their \nrenditions of events are essentially consistent with Applicant\u2019s version: that Applicant passed the \nSUV by driving down the median, that both cars engaged in aggressive driving, that Applicant \nstopped his truck once he was in front of the SUV, that he exited his vehicle and confronted the \noccupants of the SUV, that there was a physical altercation during which Applicant was punched, \nthat Applicant returned to his truck and retrieved a handgun, and that Applicant held the weapon \nin the direction of the occupants of the SUV. While there are differences in some details (e.g., who \nstarted the physical altercation, whether Applicant was initially tailgating the SUV or was brake-\nchecked, and whether Applicant pointed the weapon at the occupants of the SUV or had it in the \n\u201ctactical carry\u201d position2), the pertinent facts are consistent. \nApplicant was charged with two counts of Felony Aggravated Assault with a Deadly \nWeapon. He was allowed to enter a pre-trial diversion program and, after meeting the requirements \nof the program, the case was dismissed. Neither the driver nor passenger of the SUV was charged \nwith any offense. \nThe Judge concluded that, although Criminal Conduct disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(b) \napplied, the concern was mitigated under AG \u00b6 32(a) because Applicant\u2019s conduct \u201cwas sensible \nand consistent with logical self-defense principles\u201d and \u201cit was reasonable for Applicant to believe \nthe driver wanted to cause him harm.\u201d Decision at 6. He also found that AG \u00b6 32(d) applied and \nconcluded that \u201c[t]here is ample evidence to find there has been successful rehabilitation.\u201d Id. The \nJudge did not make a specific finding that any disqualifying condition applied under Guideline E \nbut noted that \u201cDepartment Counsel argued that \u00b6 16(c) applies.\u201d Id. Despite that ambiguity, he \nfound that AG \u00b6 17(c) applied for the same reasons he found in Applicant\u2019s favor under Guideline \nJ. Id. at 6. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government challenges several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings and argues \nthat his applications of the mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept were arbitrary, \ncapricious, and contrary to the weight of the record evidence. Underlying the Government\u2019s \nallegations of error is an assertion that the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s conduct was \njustified because he was in fear of his life. This argument has merit. \n2 Applicant described the \u201ctactical carry\u201d position as one in \u201cwhich the gun is out in front of you, but it\u2019s pointing \ndown.\u201d Tr. at 30, 41-42. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.

After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that \u201ca clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Dept. of the Navy v.

May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). As detailed below, the Judge\u2019s findings do not reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence. \nReduced to its simplest component, the essence of the security concern in this case is the \nmanner in which Applicant conducted himself under the circumstances. The Judge\u2019s mitigation \nanalyses under Guidelines E and J and his whole-person analysis are based upon his acceptance of \nApplicant\u2019s claim that the actions he took were justified because he was in fear for his life. The \nJudge found as fact that: \n[Applicant] got out of his vehicle for two reasons, first, he thought \nif the driver mistook him for someone else, seeing that he was not \nthat person would deescalate the situation. Second, Applicant feared \nfor his personal safety. He was worried because the other driver was \nacting so aggressively, they could get out of their car with a gun and \nshoot him from behind. [Decision at 2.] \nIn his mitigation analysis, the Judge concluded: \nApplicant\u2019s decision to get out of his vehicle, so that he would not \nget shot from behind, was sensible and consistent with logical self-\ndefense principles. Given his interaction on the road with the other \ndriver, it was reasonable for Applicant to believe the driver wanted \nto cause him harm. Applicant was legally carrying his firearm. \nDespite being physically attacked, Applicant used the proper \namount of force, brandishing his pistol to prevent further assault. \n[Decision at 6.] \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese findings and conclusions fail for several reasons. \nAs noted above, Applicant never claimed self-defense in his multiple interviews with law \nenforcement at the scene. Moreover, there is no factual basis in the record to support his contention \nthat he was in any serious danger or that \u201cwhatever was inside this vehicle, human-wise, they were \nextremely violent.\u201d Tr. at 24-25. No witness accounts corroborate Applicant\u2019s claim that the \nsituation began when the driver of the SUV brake-checked him without provocation or otherwise \nthreatened him. But, even accepting at face value that the brake-checking occurred, the evidence \ndoes not support a conclusion that it was an act of aggression such that it would reasonably put \nApplicant in fear for his life. Furthermore, if Applicant perceived a sense of danger that could \nsomehow justify driving on the median rather than calling 911 or simply increasing the distance \nbetween the vehicles or merging into the other lane,3 his actions after that were reckless and \ninconsistent with his claims of fear of bodily harm. He was the aggressor, not a victim, when he \nexited his truck, confronted the occupants of the SUV, and brandished a weapon. Applicant\u2019s \nattempt at an ex post facto justification of his actions by asserting that he was in danger because \nan occupant of the SUV had a criminal history is irrelevant because that fact was unknown to him \nat the time of incident and could not possibly have influenced his state of mind or his conduct. As \nsuch, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe evidence that the other driver was a habitual felony offender \ngives further credibility to Applicant\u2019s version of events and actions that day\u201d4 has no basis in the \nrecord evidence. \nThe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant feared for his life yet chose to confront the occupants \nof the SUV to \u201cdeescalate the situation\u201d is illogical and wholly inconsistent with the record \nevidence, let alone common sense. Decision at 2. Nothing in the evidence supports Applicant\u2019s \nprofessed belief that the occupants of the SUV were armed and might shoot him as he claimed as \njustification for his actions. There also is no evidence explaining why, if Applicant was in fear of \nhis life, he would exit his truck and confront a presumptively-armed individual whom he believed \nwas intent on shooting him. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding, the record evidence reflects that \nApplicant\u2019s conduct escalated, not de-escalated, the situation. Even if Applicant felt threatened \nafter having been punched \u2013 which he provoked by confronting the SUV\u2019s passenger \u2013 it does not \nfollow that re-engaging the passenger with a handgun was a warranted or necessary defensive \nresponse. \nWhile the Board gives deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determinations (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1), our deference is not unfettered. As we have previously held, when the record \u201ccontains \na basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility,\u201d the judge \u201cshould address that aspect of the record \nexplicitly.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-10158 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2008). A judge is expected to explain \nwhy an applicant\u2019s version of an event is worthy of belief when it is contradicted by other evidence \nor common sense. Failure to do so suggests that a judge \u201chas merely substituted a favorable \nimpression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.\u201d Id. \n3 Applicant\u2019s claim that it was not possible to merge into the right-hand lane is implausible. He testified that the right \nlane was bumper to bumper, so a car could not merge into that lane \u201cunless they forced themselves over and, like, \nmade a car stop to let them over.\u201d Tr. at 44-45, 47. However, rather than attempt this standard merge tactic, he elected \nto drive down the off-road median. \n4 Decision at 6. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn this instance, the Judge does not explain why he discounts evidence which, on its face, \nwould suggest that Applicant\u2019s presentation at the hearing was self-serving. In cases that do not \nproceed to trial\u2013such as this one\u2013the police report typically provides critical information about the \ncircumstances surrounding the arrest, both from the standpoint of complainants and from the \nneutral observations of law enforcement officers or witnesses. Here, the Judge failed to address \nsignificant contradictory evidence and internal inconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s state of mind \nas claimed at his security clearance hearing and the facts as he and others presented them as \nrecorded in police reports. Our review of the record convinces us that Applicant\u2019s story is \ncontradicted by other evidence and is so internally inconsistent or implausible that a reasonable \nfact finder would not accept it, undermining the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination. \nIn his mitigation analysis, the Judge considered, among other things, Applicant\u2019s lack of a \nprior criminal record, his successful completion of probation, his honorable military service, and \nthe amount of time that had elapsed since the events in question. This led him to conclude that \nApplicant had been successfully rehabilitated. However, while those facts provide a degree of \nmitigation, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not require the Judge to make an overall \nfavorable determination in the face of disqualifying conduct such as Applicant\u2019s. See ISCR Case \nNo. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). This is especially true in an instance such as this in \nwhich Applicant claims no wrongdoing in the face of significant evidence to the contrary. \nIn a security clearance adjudication, an applicant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility is an \nindication of whether he has reformed and rehabilitated himself, which is then used in concluding \nif that individual has demonstrated the high degree of reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment required of persons granted access to classified information. When an applicant is \nunwilling to accept responsibility for his own actions, \u201csuch a failure is evidence that detracts from \na finding of reform and rehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 96-0360 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). \nApplicant\u2019s adherence to an implausible explanation for his conduct seriously undercuts the \nJudge\u2019s finding that he has mitigated his misconduct. E.g., ISCR Case No. 03-01009 at n.7 (App. \nBd. Mar. 29, 2005). \nIn summary, Applicant\u2019s self-serving version of events is implausible and controverted by \nneutral witnesses and logic. The Judge failed to adequately address contradictory evidence. In \nconcluding that Applicant acted in self-defense and that his conduct was justified, the Judge \nsubstituted a favorable credibility determination that is inconsistent with the record evidence. This \nflawed credibility determination distorted his findings of fact and his analysis regarding \nApplicant\u2019s state of mind, and rendered his decision arbitrary and capricious. \nConclusion \nThe Government has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating reversible error. When the \nBoard finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the appropriate remedy \nis remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be corrected through \nremand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon correction, such as \nwhen a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified errors cannot be \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nremedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. See ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSep. 26, 2024) (citation omitted). \nConsidering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s findings are arbitrary and capricious as they \nfail to consider important aspects of the case, reflect a clear error of judgment, and run contrary to \nthe weight of the record evidence. Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable \nunder Egan. After addressing the identified errors, the Board concludes that a denial of security \nclearance eligibility is the clear outcome based on the record and the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is \nreversed. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-00583 is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: James B.

Appeal \nBrief at 1. The record indicates that the Government submitted all proposed exhibits to Applicant \non April 17, 2024, via DoD SAFE, a file transfer program. At hearing a year later, in April 2025, \nApplicant did not object to the admission of the eight exhibits but informed the Judge that he had \nbeen unable to access the documents with the password provided. Transcript at 14-16, 18-20. The \nexhibits included: Applicant\u2019s security clearance application; his response to Government \ninterrogatories in which he adopted a summary of his subject interview and provided his tax \naccount transcripts; a copy of the judgement against him; and four credit bureau reports. \nTo the extent that Applicant may be asserting a lack of due process, we find that he has \nfailed to establish a prima facie case. First, we note that Applicant had independent access to the \nsecurity clearance application and all the documents in the Government interrogatories, to include \nhis subject interview and the tax account transcripts, as he submitted the entire package again with \nhis Answer to the SOR. Second, Applicant failed at any point to ask for a continuance or to indicate \nin any way that he was unprepared to go forward at the hearing. Although pro se applicants are \nnot held to the standards of attorneys, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to \nprotect their rights. E.g., ISCR Case No. 10-03743 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2011). The record does \nnot support a conclusion that Applicant was denied the due process afforded by the Directive. \nApplicant also asserts that the unfavorable trustworthiness decision will effectively result \nin the termination of his employment. Appeal Brief at 1. The adverse impact of an unfavorable \neligibility determination on an applicant\u2019s career is not an appropriate factor for us to consider in \nevaluating national security eligibility.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 22, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On November 14, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBackground \nThe SOR alleged 15 financial concerns\u2014a mix of delinquent student loan accounts, \ndelinquent federal and state taxes, and delinquent consumer accounts. The Judge found favorably \nfor Applicant on 13 of the alleged concerns and adversely on 2 consumer accounts that totaled \napproximately $10,700. In his decision, the Judge made the following finding regarding those two \naccounts: \u201c1.g. and 1.h. Applicant admits that he has past-due debts to Creditor G totaling about \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n$10,796. Despite having two post-hearing months to submit additional evidence, Applicant has \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard.\u201d Decision at 2 (internal citations omitted). \nThe Judge\u2019s decision states that Applicant submitted \u201ctwo packets of documents\u201d post-\nhearing, which the Judge marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. \nId. at 1\u20132. Our review of the record confirms that\u2014contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding\u2014AE A contains \ndocuments regarding the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. Specifically, Applicant submitted proof of a \npayment plan and an initial payment under that plan. AE A at 13\u201314. The Judge apparently \noverlooked these documents. \nBecause the Judge found adversely on only two allegations totaling $10,700, we cannot \nassume that his error regarding one of those debts, of approximately $5,100, is harmless, as it may \nhave been outcome determinative.

On April 17, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about March 2022 \nto about October 2022 while possessing a security clearance and that, in his January 2023 security \nclearance application (SCA), he expressed an intent to continue using marijuana. In response to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations.

After graduating from college in 2021, Applicant initially \nworked as a civilian for the U.S. military and obtained a Secret security clearance for that \nemployment in July 2021. In early 2023, Applicant was hired by his current employer, a federal \ncontractor, and he completed a new SCA in January 2023 in order to obtain a Top Secret clearance. \nOn his January 2023 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had taken marijuana edibles about \nfour times between March 2022 and October 2022. In response to specific questions on the SCA, \nApplicant acknowledged that he used while holding a security clearance and indicated that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future. Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 44. In explanation of his \nintent, Applicant noted, \u201cI intend to move to an area where edibles are legal, so I may intend to \ncontinue taking them in the future.\u201d Id. Applicant\u2019s use was illegal in his state of residence. \nIn his subject interview of March 2023, Applicant stated his regret that he used marijuana, \nasserted that he had not used more recently, and vowed not to use in the future. Answer to SOR \n(Answer) at 4. In his November 2023 Answer, Applicant highlighted that he had not used \nmarijuana for over a year and attached a statement of intent to abstain from all substance abuse. \nId.; Answer, Exhibit C. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he ingested marijuana edibles while at social gatherings \nwith friends, that he did not understand the consequences at the time, and that he was not an avid \nor habitual user. Applicant explained that he did not understand the difference between state and \nfederal law either when he was using marijuana in 2022 or when he completed the SCA in January \n2023. Now aware of the illegality and the security concerns, Applicant stated his intent to never \nuse marijuana in the future. \nDuring cross-examination, the Government asked Applicant about his use since October \n2022, the date of his last disclosed incident: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So you haven\u2019t used marijuana since October of 2022. \nIs that correct? \nAPPLICANT: I decline to answer that question. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Okay. Have you used any other illegal drugs, aside \nfrom marijuana, since October of 2022? \nAPPLICANT: I also decline to answer that question. \nTranscript (Tr.) at 27. Following closing arguments in which the Government referenced \nApplicant\u2019s refusal to answer questions, the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s attorney and highlighted \nthat \u201cthroughout the investigation and even during the hearing, the Government expects that \napplicants will provide full disclosure and truthful answers to their questions.\u201d Id. at 65.

Similarly, in her Whole-\nPerson analysis, the Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s accomplishments and favorable character \nreferences but ultimately concluded that she could not ignore Applicant\u2019s refusal to answer \nquestions about more recent drug use, as that refusal raised doubts about his trustworthiness and \nreliability. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge \u201ccommitted harmful error, violated the law, \nand violated his constitutional rights in compelling his testimony and using his refusal to \nincriminate himself, without immunity, to revoke his clearance, thus impacting his employment and \nlivelihood.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. Relying primarily on National Federation of Federal Employees v. \nGreenberg, 983 F.2d 286 (D.C. Cir. 1993), Applicant argues that he satisfied the multi-pronged \ntest established therein in that: 1) he invoked the privilege against self-incrimination; 2) he did so \nin the face of \u201creal and appreciable\u201d risk of criminal self-incrimination; and 3) he was \u201ccompelled\u201d \nto testify against himself. We are not persuaded. \nWe must first address the context and history of the case relied upon, as even a cursory \nexamination confirms that the case provides no foundation for Applicant\u2019s argument. Greenberg \narose in the early 1990s when DoD began reinvestigating civilian employees who held security \nclearances at the Secret level and requested the employees complete DD Forms 398 or 398-2 (DD \nForms), personnel security questionnaires. The DD Forms informed each employee that \u201cfailure \nto furnish the requested information may result in our being unable to complete your investigation, \nwhich could result in your not being considered for clearance, access, or assignment to sensitive \nduties.\u201d Individual DoD employees and unions representing federal workers brought suit \nchallenging, on various grounds, those portions of the DD Forms that inquired into employees\u2019 \nfinancial, criminal, mental health, alcohol, and drug histories. The plaintiffs challenged the drug \nuse question \u2014 which asked for their lifetime drug history \u2014 on the ground that it violated the \nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The district court granted a preliminary \ninjunction against the administration of the questionnaire, based in part on the possibly \nincriminating nature of responses to the drug question and the DD Forms\u2019 general warning that \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26: (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) \nthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation employees provided may be turned over to federal, state, or local law enforcement \nauthorities if it indicated a violation of law. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit reversed, highlighting in \npertinent part that none of the plaintiffs had invoked the privilege and that the plaintiffs were \nunlikely to succeed in their facial attack, as multiple scenarios were possible in which no self-\nincrimination risks would arise (e.g., cases in which drug use was outside the statute of limitations, \nor the risk of self-incrimination was improbable, or DoD responded to an employee\u2019s assertion of \nthe privilege by offering use immunity). \nFollowing reversal, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, again challenging the same \nquestions on various constitutional grounds, and both parties moved for summary judgment. While \nthe action was pending, the DD Forms were superseded by Standard Form (SF) 86 effective \nJanuary 1, 1996. Notably, the SF 86 provided that answers to the drug use question would not be \nused in subsequent criminal proceedings, and it limited inquiries regarding financial history, drug \nuse, and mental health to the most recent seven years. In granting summary judgment for the \nplaintiffs, the district court held, in pertinent part, the illegal drug use question on the SF 86 would \nnot violate the Fifth Amendment because it contained the equivalent of a use immunity statement. \nBecause the DD Forms did not contain such a statement, the district court held that their use was \nunconstitutional. The Government appealed, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated the DoD plaintiffs\u2019 \ncase with a challenge brought by HUD employees as the two cases presented the same issues of \nconstitutional law. \nIn reversing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs, the Court held \nthat the DD FORMs did not violate the employees\u2019 Fifth Amendment right against self-\nincrimination, explaining\u2014 \nThe district court held that because the DD Forms do not guarantee that answers to \nthe substance abuse question would not be used against the employee in subsequent \ncriminal proceedings, the questions were unconstitutional under the Fifth \nAmendment. We disagree. As we held in Greenberg, the privilege against self-\nincrimination must be invoked. 983 F.2d at 291. \u201cThe Fifth Amendment does not \nforbid the government from asking questions and it does not forbid the government \nfrom taking answers.\u201d Id. Instead, the Fifth Amendment prohibits use of that \ninformation in a subsequent criminal proceeding. There is no indication in the \nrecord that the employees have a reasonable basis for a fear of criminal prosecution \nbased on their answers to the DD Forms. \nAm. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. v. HUD, 118 F.3d 786, 794-95 (D.C. Cir. 1997). To summarize, in the \ncase relied upon by Applicant, the Court ultimately found that the drug use questions at issue\u2014 \nwhich asked about lifetime drug use and offered no use immunity\u2014did not implicate the Fifth \nAmendment because 1) the employees did not invoke; and 2) they had no reasonable basis for a \nfear of criminal prosecution based on their answers. \nIn light of that history, we turn to Applicant\u2019s case and some of the many reasons why his \nFifth Amendment challenge fails. First, and most importantly, Section 23 of his SCA (an SF 86), \nwhich inquires into illegal drug use, clearly advises that \u201cneither your truthful responses nor \ninformation derived from your responses to this section will be used as evidence against you in a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubsequent criminal proceeding.\u201d GE 1 at 44. That same assurance regarding the drug use section \nis repeated in the general instructions for completing the SCA. Id. at 2. That language, which \nApplicant\u2019s counsel fails to acknowledge or address in her brief, serves as a pre-emptive grant of \nuse immunity on Applicant\u2019s derivative drug use disclosures during the adjudication of his \nnational security eligibility. The Court in Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps. found no Fifth Amendment \nviolation even absent use immunity language. Where such language has been added, as here, \nclearly no risk of criminal prosecution arises from questions about drug use or truthful answers \nthereto. \nSecond, Applicant did not invoke the privilege as required. Represented by counsel at \nhearing, Applicant apparently made the purposeful decision not to assert the privilege but instead \nto respond to the Government\u2019s question by stating \u201cI decline to answer that question.\u201d Tr. at 27. \nThat does not suffice. As the Government highlights in its Reply Brief, the requirement to \nexpressly invoke serves multiple judicial purposes. Reply Brief at 10 (citing Salinas vs. Texas, 570 \nU.S. 178, 183-84 (2013)). Among them, Applicant\u2019s failure to invoke denied the Government clear \nnotice of his claim of privilege, which they would have opposed at the hearing itself. As a general \nproposition, the rule also ensures a contemporaneous record of a party\u2019s refusal to answer upon \nwhich a judge can rule. In the context of this case, had Applicant forthrightly invoked the Fifth \nAmendment, the Judge would have had the opportunity to remind him of the language in Section \n23 and to assure him that he had no valid self-incrimination concerns. \nApplicant cites to Salinas for the proposition that he was not required to invoke the Fifth \nAmendment to now enjoy its protection. His reliance on Salinas is as misplaced as his reliance on \nGreenberg. In Salinas, the Court highlighted various scenarios in which an individual need not \nexpressly invoke the privilege because some form of official compulsion denies him a free choice \nto admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer. The Court went on to find, however, that \u201c[p]etitioner \ncannot benefit from that principle because it is undisputed that his interview with police was \nvoluntary,\u201d which \u201cplaces petitioner\u2019s situation outside the scope of . . . cases in which we have \nheld that various forms of governmental coercion prevented defendants from voluntarily invoking \nthe privilege.\u201d Salinas, 570 U.S. at 185 (emphasis added). This brings us to the third reason why \nApplicant\u2019s challenge fails\u2014Applicant requested this hearing, rather than electing a resolution on \nthe written record, and his attendance was indisputably voluntary. As the Court found in Salinas, \nit would have been \u201ca simple matter\u201d for Applicant to say that he was not answering the \nGovernment\u2019s question on Fifth Amendment grounds. Id. at 186. Applicant\u2019s failure to invoke the \nprivilege in this voluntary setting is fatal to his claim.2 \nFinally, despite Applicant\u2019s claims of a fear of prosecution, there is nothing in this record \nthat indicates he had a reasonable basis for such a fear. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed four uses \nof marijuana edibles between March and October 2022. In his November 2023 Answer, Applicant \nasserted that he had not used marijuana for over a year and attached a statement of intent to abstain. \nAt hearing, he testified that he ingested the edibles while at social gatherings with friends and that \nhe was not an avid or habitual user. In the context of this record, the risk of self-incrimination is \nnot \u201creal and appreciable\u201d but is instead \u201cso improbable that no reasonable man would suffer it to \n2 As a separate and fundamental issue, Applicant was clearly not entitled to take the stand and testify on the issue of \nhis drug use and then refuse to answer questions on cross-examination directly related to his testimony. Brown v. \nUnited States, 356 U.S. 148, 155-156 (1958). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninfluence his conduct.\u201d Greenberg, 983 F.2d at 293 (citation omitted.). Neither the Government\u2019s \nnor the Judge\u2019s questions to Applicant about his drug use can possibly be considered \nunconstitutional when Applicant did not reasonably believe that his answer would subject him to \ncriminal liability. \nOne last note. In Applicant\u2019s brief, he cites briefly3 to the Procedures provision of the \nDirective, which reads in pertinent part: \nThe applicant may elect on constitutional or other grounds not to comply; but \nrefusal or failure to furnish or authorize the providing of relevant and material \ninformation or otherwise cooperate at, any stage in the investigation or adjudicative \nprocess may prevent the DOHA from making a clearance decision. If an applicant \nfails or refuses to: \n. \n. \n. \nFollow directions of an Administrative Judge or the Appeal Board; then the Director, \nDOHA, or designee, may revoke any security clearance held by the applicant and \ndiscontinue case processing. Requests for resumption of case processing and \nreinstatement of a security clearance may be approved by the Director, DOHA, only \nupon a showing of good cause. \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 6.2, 6.2.3. From his brief, we are unclear whether Applicant is challenging the \nconstitutionality of this portion of the Directive in addition to challenging the Judge\u2019s disposition \nof his case. Assuming arguendo that is his purpose, it is well-established that the Appeal Board \nhas no jurisdiction over claims regarding the legality or constitutionality of the Directive,4 and we \ndecline to entertain this ambiguous challenge as well outside our lane of authority. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. Our review of the record confirms that the Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this \nrecord. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with \nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of Navy v.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nAndrea M. Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 22, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, \n1992, as amended) (Directive). On April 3, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson granted Applicant national security eligibility. \nThe Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges that Applicant has a long-term girlfriend who is a \ncitizen and resident of Thailand and that he provides her approximately $700 per month in financial \nsupport. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s access to classified information was \nsuspended in August 2020; that he was terminated or resigned under threat of termination in April \n2016; and that, while employed by his current employer, Applicant\u2019s supervisors were forced to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nbecome involved after coworkers complained about Applicant\u2019s conduct. For the below reasons, \nwe reverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nBackground \nApplicant is 59, unmarried, and has no children. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautics. \nHe served in the U.S. military from November 1991 until his retirement in September 2011. After \nretirement, Applicant accepted a job with a federal contractor. He worked for that first contractor \nfrom November 2012 through August 2015, when a new company took over the contract. He \nworked in the same position for the second contractor from August 2015 to April 2016, when he \nwas terminated as discussed below. Applicant has worked as a contractor for his present employer \nsince July 2016. From July 2016 to September 2020, Applicant worked for his current employer \nin South Korea. He held national security eligibility throughout the course of his military career \nand employment as a contractor, until it was suspended by the Director of the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency in September 2020. When his national security eligibility \nwas suspended, Applicant returned to the United States but continued to work for his current \nemployer. \nGuideline B \nIn late 2010, while visiting Thailand as a tourist, Applicant met an 18-year-old citizen and \nresident of Thailand (NF), who became his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d1 NF was working as a bar girl or hostess \nwhen Applicant met her, and they began a romantic relationship. After about a year, NF stopped \nworking, and Applicant began financially supporting her. From late 2010 to September 2016, \nApplicant would contact her every couple of days or so.2 He was living in the United States during \nthis timeframe. Their in-person contact increased when Applicant moved to South Korea in 2016 \nand decreased again when he returned to the United States in 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend is now 33. She has a 9-year-old son with a different man. Applicant \nmaintains daily contact with her and sends her money through Western Union frequently. \nApplicant\u2019s estimates of how much money he sends her fluctuate. His Answer to the SOR reflected \nthat in 2024 he only sent her $1,000 to $1,200, but his March 2023 SCAs indicated he sends about \n$325 every two weeks. He reported that he gave NF $10,000 for an anniversary gift about seven \nyears ago, and coworkers report that Applicant sent her $10,000 at the time that his clearance was \nsuspended in 2020. Applicant believes that NF saved around $35,000 of his money in a Thai bank \naccount for the purchase of their retirement home. In Applicant\u2019s answer to Interrogatories, he \nexplained that she has since spent that money to build a house on her family\u2019s property in Thailand. \nNF is listed as the owner of the home. He continues to send her money to pay her living expenses \nas needed. They communicate by messenger frequently, though his estimates on their contact vary. \n1 Applicant has been inconsistent in his statements about when the relationship began. In an October 2020 background \ninterview, Applicant reported that the relationship began in late 2010, and he affirmed that date in interrogatories and \ntestimony. In completing his 2019 and 2023 security clearance applications (SCAs), however, Applicant listed the \ndate they met as October 2012. \n2 The Judge found Applicant would \u201csee\u201d her every couple of days or so, but in-person contact is not supported by the \nrecord, except during the time he lived in South Korea or was traveling to Thailand.

On \nit, he disclosed his travel to Thailand from September 2010 to October 2010 and from December \n2010 to January 2011, but he failed to report any foreign contacts, to include NF. \nIn his 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed his two previously-reported trips to Thailand along \nwith five other trips there including: April 2017, December 2017 to January 2018, June 2018, \nJanuary 2019, and April 2019. He also disclosed that he cohabitated with NF since September 15, \n2016. In his subsequent 2020 background interview, Applicant clarified that it was at this time that \nNF became his \u201cserious girlfriend.\u201d Government Exhibit (GE) 7 at 8. Several times a year, she \nwould fly from Thailand to visit him in South Korea and stay around one to three months at a time, \nand Applicant would visit Thailand to see her a couple times a year. \nApplicant\u2019s March 30, 2023, SCA lists travel to Thailand in May to June 2022. \nAdditionally, Applicant testified he last traveled to Thailand in December 2024. Since his return \nto the United States in late 2020, Applicant currently only travels to see NF once per year. He \nplans to move to Thailand after he retires. Applicant claims his girlfriend has no affiliation with \nthe government of Thailand. Applicant also asserted that he reported his relationship with NF to \nhis current employer\u2019s security office, via his supervisor, in compliance with security rules and \nregulations.3 \nDuring the course of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, several coworkers referenced \nApplicant\u2019s financial support of other female foreign nationals in Thailand and/or South Korea \nwhom he met in bars. One coworker told the investigator that Applicant had \u201cside girls,\u201d with \nwhom he would occasionally go on dates and have sex without his girlfriend\u2019s knowledge. \nTestifying for Applicant at the hearing, the coworker confirmed this information. Applicant denies \nsexual relations with any of these women. Instead, he testified that he sent money to the two other \nfemale foreign nationals to help during COVID-19, when they lost their jobs. These relationships \nare not alleged in the SOR. \nIn assessing the heightened risk of Applicant holding a security clearance, an applicant\u2019s \nties to a hostile country are important. However, even countries friendly to the United States have \nattempted to gain unauthorized access to classified information. The Judge took administrative \nnotice of information provided by both the Government and Applicant concerning Thailand, which \nincluded the following: \nIn a 2023 Report to Congress, the US-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission reported that Thailand is a member of the China-led Asia Pacific \nSpace Cooperation Organization (APSCO), is a recipient of Chinese Arms, and is \none of the top five most frequent military diplomatic partners of the Chinese \nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) with whom they have conducted military \nexercises. Chinese companies are expanding their presence in Thailand and are \ncircumventing Thai law to secure ownership of local media outlets in an effort to \n3 In the Judge\u2019s analysis, she incorrectly concludes that, \u201cWhen the relationship started, he reported it to his employer, \nand the fact that he was financially supporting her.\u201d Decision at 8. The evidence suggests only that he reported it to \nhis current employer. When the relationship started in 2010, Applicant was still on active duty. The record evidence \ndoes not support a finding that Applicant reported the relationship to his command. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshape the media environment in Thailand.

The SOR alleged that he was terminated \nfrom his second defense contractor employer in 2016 following a conflict with a coworker, and it \ndescribed two prior incidents as well. The Judge highlighted one of those incidents as being of \n\u201cparticular concern.\u201d Id. at 4. Applicant brought a target practice silhouette, with bullet holes in it, \ninto the workplace and hung it on the office wall where it was visible to all. The Judge found that \n\u201c[n]ames of coworkers were written on the silhouette as well as threats\u201d despite Applicant\u2019s \ndenials that names or threats were written on it. Id. His explanations of record about why he \nbrought the silhouette into the office vary from claiming it was a joke to asserting that he brought \nthe target into work \u201cto display to my coworkers as a challenge to improve their marksmanship.\u201d \nAnswer to SOR (Answer) at 3. \nThe SOR also alleged, and the Judge discussed, an incident in which Applicant brought a \nsword to work, took it out of its case in front of his coworkers, and purportedly swung it around. \nApplicant was told to remove the sword from the workplace and to not bring it back. Applicant \nadmitted bringing the sword to the office but testified, \u201cI did not swing the sword, nor did I use \nthe sword in any manner that could be construed as a threat.\u201d Transcript (Tr.) at 40. \nAs the SOR alleged, Applicant was terminated from this employment in 2016, following a \nconflict with a coworker for which he was reprimanded. Applicant has given conflicting reports \nof why he was terminated. In his background interview of October 2020, Applicant identified the \ncause as an isolated incident in April 2016 in which he followed the female coworker into the \nground control room \u201cfor no particular reason\u201d and remained in the room for 15 to 20 minutes \u201cto \nmake sure [she] did not fiddle with anything.\u201d GE 7 at 3. Applicant repeatedly asserted to the \ninvestigator that he and the female colleague had no personality conflicts or issues of any kind \nprior to this single incident, after which he was informed that he was released. Id. at 3\u20134. In his \nsubsequent Answer to the SOR, Applicant asserted instead that the termination was due to a \n\u201cverbal confrontation\u201d with the female coworker because she was violating procedures in a manner \nthat \u201cconstituted interference with an aircraft in flight.\u201d Answer at 3. At hearing, Applicant \nreverted to his explanation that he had merely followed the female colleague into a room: \u201cShe \nwas told to go and write down some radar settings. And so I went into . . . the ground control \nstation and sat and watched the mission while she was in there transcribing whatever it is that she \nwas writing, I never spoke to her and I never approached her or said hi or bye or anything.

In addition to the alleged silhouette and sword incidents discussed above, the record \nevidence suggest a host of other workplace issues at this employment, to include: that Applicant \nhad been the subject of IG investigations, that he had been the subject of an Air Force Office of \nSpecial Investigations investigation; that he frequently viewed \u201csoft porn\u201d or scantily-clad Asian \nwomen on his Government computer; that he had personality conflicts with multiple employees; \nthat coworkers considered him to be \u201cmentally unstable\u201d and a \u201cloose cannon\u201d; that he \u201cblew up\u201d \nand screamed at a female coworker in front of others, resulting in a complaint against him and a \nreprimand; and that the same coworker later initiated a second complaint for continued harassment. \nGE 11 at 1; GE 12 at 2; GE 13 at 2, 3.

When a judge\u2019s factual \nfindings are challenged, the Board must determine whether the \u201cfindings of fact are supported by \nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in \nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nWhen a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary \nor capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless?; (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds?; and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline B \nmitigating conditions, Guideline E mitigating conditions, and analysis under the Whole-Person \nConcept were arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record evidence. Applicant argues in \nhis Response Brief that the Judge properly applied the mitigating conditions and that her findings \nare entitled to deference. \nGuideline B \nAt the outset, the Board notes that the Judge\u2019s analysis identifies three disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 7 \u201cas potentially applicable\u201d to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin Thailand: AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f).5 However, the Judge never states which, if any, she found \nto be applicable.

Decision at 8. As we have previously stated, a judge\u2019s decision must \nbe written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to discern what findings the judge is \nmaking and what conclusions she is reaching. ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, \n2018). In failing to identify what disqualifying conditions she found applicable, the Judge clouded \nappellate review, leaving the Board to decipher what may have been her reasoning and \nconclusions. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard to meet. It is a risk that is greater than the normal \nrisk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. Depending on the \ncircumstances of a case, one or more foreign contacts even in a country that is friendly to the U.S. \nmay create a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nISCR Case No. 17-04278 at 3, n.1 (App. Bd. May 23, 2019). Here, the Judge found that Thailand \nhas strengthening ties with China, that U.S. citizens are at risk of death or injury due to the \npossibility of indiscriminate attacks in public places, and that significant human rights abuses have \noccurred in Thailand. These facts establish a heightened risk. Moreover, the SOR alleges, and \nApplicant admits, that Applicant\u2019s long-term girlfriend is a citizen and resident of Thailand and \nthat Applicant provides her financial support. Consequently, the record supports the application of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). \nTurning to mitigation, the Judge found that Applicant established AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), \nand 8(e).6 Focusing on the alleged relationship with NF, the Government argues that Applicant \nfailed to meet his burden of persuasion to afford full application of any of the mitigating conditions. \nWe agree. The Judge errs in her analysis of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) for two reasons: she minimized \nthe nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend; and she failed to sufficiently consider the \nsecurity significance of the heightened risk with respect to Thailand, especially as it relates to \n5 AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nclassified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country \nby providing that information or technology; 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the individual to a heightened risk of \nforeign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest. \n6 AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or \nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the United States; 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or \nobligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual \nhas such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation; 8(e): \nthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, \nor threats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChina. On the first issue, despite finding that Applicant and NF have \u201cdaily or weekly telephonic \ncontact\u201d and cohabitated from 2016 to 2020, the Judge deemed their contact to be \u201climited, casual, \nand infrequent.\u201d Decision at 3, 9. That conclusion runs contrary to the record evidence and \nconstitutes error. The close nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with NF is reflected in his regular \ncommunication with her, his significant financial support of her, and his plans to have a future \nwith her, even if their relationship is currently long-distance. \nThe Judge also does not give any consideration to the relevant risks associated with \nThailand in her mitigating analysis, though she included them in the statement of facts. In \nGuideline B cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, including its human rights \nrecord, are among the important considerations for the judge, including as part of the Whole-\nPerson analysis. ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). Crucial to this analysis is \nan accurate and current assessment of the geopolitical situation in the country. See ISCR Case No. \n07-14508 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2008). The Judge failed to sufficiently consider the current \nrelevant geopolitical situation of Thailand. \nApplicant had the burden to establish mitigation. Yet the Judge failed to recognize \nApplicant\u2019s burden to demonstrate that his girlfriend is not a means of coercion or exploitation and \nfailed to properly weigh the evidence. Applicant has invested both emotionally and financially in \nhis relationship with NF. Although he served honorably in the military for 20 years and argues that \nhe is firmly rooted in the United States, Applicant reports no close ties in the United States, no \nsignificant financial assets, and no other longstanding relationships or loyalties in the United \nStates. Indeed, there is significant evidence to the contrary. Applicant\u2019s coworkers reported that \nApplicant expressed a preference for Asia, to include: that he \u201calways talked about how he would \nrather live in an Asian country over the US\u201d; that he traveled extensively in Asia and had ties to \nfemale foreign nationals; that he \u201ctalked negatively about his . . . past in the military\u201d; that he felt \nwronged by the U.S. government and \u201cwould go on rants about [his branch of service] and \ngovernment and was very bitter towards [his branch of service]\u201d; and that he talked frequently \nabout his plans to retire in Thailand. GE 11 at 2; GE 12 at 2; GE 13 at 3. These same coworkers \nexpressed reservations about Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility in light of their concerns. \nId. In concluding that Applicant \u201chas shown a deep and longstanding relationship with or loyalties \nto, the United States,\u201d the Judge failed to examine and weigh this troubling evidence to the \ncontrary. Decision at 9. \nIn summary, the Judge erred in finding that Applicant met his burden to establish that it is \nunlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his girlfriend \nand the interests of the United States, or that Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to his \ngirlfriend is so minimal, or that Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest. The Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) reflects a clear error in \njudgment and offers an explanation that runs contrary to the record. \nThe Judge also found that Applicant established AG \u00b6 8(e), concluding that: \u201cAll foreign \ncontacts he has made have been promptly reported to his company supervisor and security officer, \nand he plans to continue to follow all reporting requirements.

However, the record does not support that he reported his relationship to his active-\nduty command in 2010 or to the first two contractors that employed him from 2012 through 2016. \nHe did not report his relationship with NF on his 2013 SCA, nor did he report his \u201cside girls\u201d on \nhis subsequent SCAs. The Judge\u2019s application of AG \u00b6 8(e) runs contrary to the record evidence. \nGuideline E \nThe Judge identified AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d), and 16(e)7 as raising security concerns without \nanalysis and identified AG \u00b6 17(d) as the singular mitigating condition that was potentially \napplicable.8 Regarding the allegation at SOR\u00b6 2(b), that Applicant was terminated following a \nseries of events at the second defense contractor, the Judge found that Applicant \u201cadmits that the \nunderlying conduct occurred, but not that his behavior was inappropriate.\u201d Decision at 10. That \nfinding is contradicted by the record. Applicant denied writing names or threats on the silhouette, \ndenied harassing his female coworker, denied a verbal confrontation with her, denied any other \nissues while employed at this jobsite, and denied being terminated in April 2016. The Government \nargues persuasively that the language of AG \u00b6 17(d) requires Applicant to first acknowledge his \nmistake and then engage in counseling or other corrective behaviors. Applicant\u2019s constant \nminimization of his troublesome conduct is incongruent with a finding that he has acknowledged \nthe behavior. As we have held in the past, when an applicant is unwilling to accept responsibility \nfor his own actions, \u201csuch a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and \nrehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 96-0360 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). The record evidence does \nnot support full application of AG \u00b6 17(d). \nWhole-Person Analysis \nThe Government argues that the Judge\u2019s Whole-Person analysis addresses the record \nevidence in a piece-meal fashion and does not consider the record as a whole. Specifically, the \nGovernment highlights Applicant\u2019s numerous inconsistent statements, addressed above. Given the \nrecord in this case, the Government\u2019s argument is persuasive. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s Whole-\nPerson analysis simply incorporates her comments under Guidelines B and E. To the extent that \nwe found error there, we find similar error here. \n7 AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which when considered as a whole, supports a whole person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information; 16 (d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and \nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or :sensitive information.

Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n8 AG \u00b6 17 (d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is in her mid-fifties and was born in the former Soviet Union in what is now Ukraine. Applicant became a citizen of Belarus because she lived there when the Soviet Union dissolved. She lived in Germany from 1994 through 2003, when she married a U.S. servicemember and moved to the United States. The couple subsequently had two children who were born in the United States but were entitled to Belarusian citizenship by virtue of their mother\u2019s. At Applicant\u2019s request, her children\u2019s Belarusian citizenship was terminated when both were very young, and Applicant herself was naturalized in 2007. The family has lived in the United States continuously, except from 2014 to 2019, when the family lived in Europe pursuant to her husband\u2019s military orders. Applicant has a college degree and a master\u2019s degree and has held a security clearance since 2018 without reported incident. From 2005 to 2015, Applicant worked for various federal contractors, providing language and cultural instruction to U.S. military members. Since 2015, Applicant has been employed by a sole federal contractor in various positions, including as a linguist, a cultural and language instructor, and a site lead. Upon her return to the U.S. in 2019, Applicant transitioned to working for the contractor as a consultant and, since early 2021, as an analyst, conducting research and developing products for her DoD customers.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 16, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 a security concern raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On February 28, 2025, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Eric C. Price denied Applicant national \nsecurity eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother and father are resident citizens of Belarus, and \nthe Judge found against Applicant on the sole Guideline B concern. On appeal, Applicant asserts \ntwo arguments: that the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, rendering his \nadverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and that he applied an unreasonable per \nse rule that disqualifies any applicant with family member in Belarus or countries with similar \ngeopolitical conditions.

Applicant became a citizen of Belarus because she lived there when the Soviet Union \ndissolved. She lived in Germany from 1994 through 2003, when she married a U.S. servicemember \nand moved to the United States. The couple subsequently had two children who were born in the \nUnited States but were entitled to Belarusian citizenship by virtue of their mother\u2019s. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, her children\u2019s Belarusian citizenship was terminated when both were very young, and \nApplicant herself was naturalized in 2007. The family has lived in the United States continuously, \nexcept from 2014 to 2019, when the family lived in Europe pursuant to her husband\u2019s military \norders. Applicant has a college degree and a master\u2019s degree and has held a security clearance since \n2018 without reported incident. \nFrom 2005 to 2015, Applicant worked for various federal contractors, providing language \nand cultural instruction to U.S. military members. Since 2015, Applicant has been employed by a \nsole federal contractor in various positions, including as a linguist, a cultural and language \ninstructor, and a site lead. Upon her return to the U.S. in 2019, Applicant transitioned to working \nfor the contractor as a consultant and, since early 2021, as an analyst, conducting research and \ndeveloping products for her DoD customers. Applicant receives glowing performance reviews and \nhas earned several awards and other accolades for outstanding analysis and support to her federal \ncustomers and for her contributions to U.S. national security. \nApplicant has no siblings. Her parents are both nearly 80 years old, retired, and have no \nconnection to the Belarusian government except for their state pensions totaling about $500 per \nmonth. Applicant provides financial assistance to her parents for medical and dental expenses and \nsends money on their birthdays. Her parents own an apartment in Belarus valued at about $35,000, \nwhich Applicant expects them to sell in the next few years if they emigrate from Belarus. If they \ndo not sell the apartment, Applicant will inherit it. Applicant is close to her parents, communicating \nwith them weekly. Because of concerns that their phone calls are monitored, Applicant\u2019s phone \nconversations with her parents are mundane and do not include any information about her job, her \nhusband\u2019s job, or anything of potential interest to Belarusian authorities. Her parents apparently \nbelieve that Applicant is still teaching Russian and do not know that she has a security clearance. \nAlthough they are aware that Applicant\u2019s husband is in the military, they have not inquired about \nhis work. Applicant testified credibly that, if she learned that one of her parents was contacted about \nwhat she did for a living, she would report the contact to her supervisor and security officer. \nUntil about six years ago, Applicant regularly traveled to Belarus to visit her parents and a \nnow-deceased grandmother. Under the current regime, Applicant no longer visits Belarus and \nbelieves it is also unsafe for her children, in part because of the risk of arbitrary detention. Instead, \nApplicant meets her parents in third countries, or they visit her in the U.S. Applicant retained her \nBelarusian passport to facilitate visits to see her parents, but she no longer needs the passport, \nwhich will expire within a few years. Applicant stated her intent to renounce her Belarusian \ncitizenship once her parents move to the U.S. or another country. Because U.S. consular services \nare currently unavailable in Belarus, her parents must travel elsewhere to apply for U.S. permanent \nresidence status. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther than her parents, Applicant has no relatives or ties in Belarus. Applicant testified \nthat, if she had to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests of Belarus, \nshe would choose the United States. She highlighted that her ties to the U.S. are much stronger: \nher citizenship, husband, children, and livelihood are all in the United States. Her U.S. financial \nassets are significant and include bank and high yield accounts, retirement accounts, and real \nestate. There is no evidence that Applicant or her parents have been subject to any threats, \nexploitation, manipulation, inducement, pressure, coercion, or other security concerning behavior. \nAdministrative Notice \nTurning first to the Republic of Belarus, the Judge took administrative notice of the \nfollowing facts among others: Belarus has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia \nthan any of the other former Soviet republics. Since his election in 1994, the president has \nconsolidated his power through authoritarian means. In the wake of the disputed 2020 presidential \nelection, massive nationwide protests were met with violent repression, thousands of arrests, and \nreports of torture of detainees. Since 2022, Belarus has facilitated Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which \nwas launched in part from Belarusian territory, resulting in U.S. sanctions against the regime. \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a \u201cDo Not Travel\u201d advisory for Belarus due to \nBelarusian authorities\u2019 continued facilitation of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, the presence of \nRussian forces in Belarus, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, potential for civil unrest, risk of \ndetention, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s limited ability to provide support to U.S. citizens. All consular \nservices were suspended on February 28, 2022. Additionally, Belarus enforces special restrictions \non dual U.S.-Belarusian nationals and may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Belarusian nationals\u2019 \nU.S. citizenship. \nRegarding the Russian Federation, the Judge took administrative notice of the following \nfacts among others. The Russian Federation has an authoritarian political system dominated by \nPresident Vladimir Putin. In addition to ongoing Russian aggression in Georgia and Ukraine, \nRussia has attempted to position itself as a great power competitor of the United States, using \nvarious means to undermine Western core institutions and to weaken faith in the democratic and \nfree market system. An aggressive and capable collector of sensitive U.S. technologies, Russia uses \ncyberspace, cyber espionage, and covert agents to penetrate both public and private U.S. \nenterprises. In Ukraine, Russian armed forces have committed numerous war crimes and other \natrocities. At home, Russia also has significant human rights issues, including arbitrary or unlawful \nkillings, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, pervasive torture, sexual violence, and the \nsevere suppression of the media. \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Russia, advising \nU.S. persons not to travel to Russia due to unpredictable consequences of the unprovoked invasion \nof Ukraine, the potential for harassment and detention of U.S. citizens, the arbitrary enforcement \nof local laws, the U.S. Embassy\u2019s limited ability to provide support to U.S. citizens in Russia, and \nthe possibility of terrorism. \nThe Government stated its position that \u201cthe close and ongoing nature of the ties between \nBelarus and Russia are relevant considerations,\u201d but clarified that Belarus\u2014unlike Russia\u2014should \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nnot be considered a nation with interests hostile to the United States and that Applicant \nconsequently does not carry the \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d that flows from connections in a \nhostile country. Decision at 5 (internal citations omitted). \nJudge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Judge concluded that the following factors, taken together, created both a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a) and a potential conflict of interest under \nAG \u00b6 7(b): Belarus\u2019s continued facilitation of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine; its close political, \neconomic, and military ties to Russia; its arbitrary enforcement of local laws; the potential for civil \nunrest; the risk of detention; the U.S. Embassy\u2019s limited ability to provide support to U.S. citizens; \nApplicant\u2019s frequent communications with her parents; their close ties and bonds of affection; her \nparents\u2019 dependence upon the Belarusian government for their pensions; and the fact that their \ncommunications may be subject to monitoring.1 \nIn concluding that none of the mitigating conditions fully applied, the Judge highlighted \nthat an adjudication under Guideline B \u201cis not a judgment on an applicant\u2019s character or loyalty to \nthe United States\u201d but rather is \u201ca determination as to whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances \nforeseeably present a security risk.\u201d Id. at 9. \nThe concern here pertains to the risk to Applicant\u2019s parents residing in Belarus and \nhow that risk could be used to potentially coerce Applicant. It does not relate to her \nloyalty to the United States. I am persuaded by Applicant\u2019s testimony, corroborated \nby other record evidence including character letters that there is not a question as \nto her loyalty to the United States, her valuable contributions and commitment to \nnational security, or her sincere intent to resolve any potential conflict of interest \nin favor of U.S. interests. She has deep and longstanding relationships, and \nsignificant connections and loyalty to the United States. She has made the U.S. her \nhome, is a productive and law-abiding citizen, and has made significant \ncontributions to U.S. national security. However, based upon the current \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in Belarus, I am unable to find that this Applicant \ncould be expected to resolve any conflict of interest between her commitment and \nloyalty to her parents in favor of the United States interests if a conflict of interest \narose. I am also unable to find that it is unlikely that Applicant would be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between her parents and the interests of the United \nStates. [Id. at 9-10.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal are two-fold. First, she contends that the Judge failed to \nconsider all the favorable evidence in conducting his mitigation and Whole-Person Concept \nanalysis, rendering his decision arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Second, Applicant \n1 The Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s financial interest in her parents\u2019 apartment established a security concern \nunder AG \u00b6 7(f), but concluded this concern to be mitigated as the value of Applicant\u2019s financial interest was \n\u201cspeculative and de minimis\u201d and dwarfed by her financial interests in the United States. Decision at 10. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nargues that the Judge \u201cimproperly create[d] a per se rule against security clearance eligibility for \napplicants with foreign relatives, despite DoD policy requiring an individualized assessment of \nrisk.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. \nWe turn first to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge \u201coverlooked critical evidence \ndemonstrating that [Applicant] has taken extensive steps to mitigate any potential security \nconcerns.\u201d Id. at 7. Her Counsel lists five specific factors that the Judge purportedly overlooked: \nApplicant\u2019s lack of financial interests, political ties, or business relationships in Belarus; the fact \nthat her parents receive only a minimal pension from the Belarusian government; Applicant\u2019s \nrefusal to travel to Belarus and her recognition of the country as unsafe for herself and her children; \nher unblemished security clearance history and numerous commendations; and her strong ties to \nthe Unities States, including her citizenship, family, career , and financial investments. As is clear \nfrom the above summary of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and his analysis, the Judge explicitly \nconsidered and weighed all factors identified by Counsel as overlooked. Applicant\u2019s arguments \namount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of this evidence, which is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn Applicant\u2019s second argument, she challenges the conclusion that is at the heart of the \nJudge\u2019s ruling\u2014that despite Applicant\u2019s longstanding ties and demonstrated loyalty to the United \nStates, the current geopolitical conditions in Belarus preclude security clearance eligibility while \nher parents remain there. Through counsel, Applicant takes broad aim at the Judge\u2019s reliance on \n\u201cspeculative risks tied to external geopolitical conditions\u201d that are beyond her control: \nThe term \u201cexternal geopolitical conditions\u201d does not exist in the \nadjudicative guidelines. It is a contrived and undefined phrase, seemingly invented \nby the judge to justify an irrational decision. By relying on this arbitrary standard, \nthe judge has effectively created a new disqualifying factor\u2014something that is \nimpermissible under the guidelines. \n. . . \nThe ruling does not follow the [] Adjudicative Guidelines and instead establishes a \nreckless precedent based on an undefined, extrajudicial standard. If upheld, this \napproach could disqualify countless loyal, qualified individuals based on nothing \nmore that the mere existence of family in certain foreign countries. [Decision at 10, \n11, 12.] \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, it is well settled in Guideline B cases that \u201ca current and \naccurate assessment of the \u2018geopolitical situation\u2019 and the \u2018security/intelligence profile of the \ncountry vis-a-vis the United States\u2019 is crucial.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-14508 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2008). We have repeatedly and consistently held that the judge must consider the record evidence \nin the context of the nature of the foreign government involved, the intelligence-gathering history \nof that government, its human rights record, and the presence of terrorist activity. E.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 05-03250 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 18-02802 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 6, 2019).

We find this assignment of error to be without merit. \nIn a related argument, Applicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s decision \u201cappears to place \nexcessive weight on hypothetical risks rather than actual evidence of foreign influence.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 8. It is well-established, however, that the Government is not required to prove an actual \nthreat of coercion, inducement, or espionage. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 9, 2009). Moreover, the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government\u201d2 is firmly grounded \nin Appeal Board precedent. ISCR Case No. 18-02802 at 3 (citing additional cases). Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s arguments, factors such as a relative\u2019s obscurity or the failure of foreign authorities to \ncontact those relatives in the past do not provide a meaningful measure of whether an applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances pose a security risk. E.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 5. As the Judge\u2019s decision \nmakes clear, Applicant\u2019s conduct, loyalty, and character are not in issue but rather the geopolitical \nconditions in which her parents live. Even a person of the highest character could be faced with \ncircumstances under which she would be tempted to place the safety of loved ones ahead of \ncompeting interests. E.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03991 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2021).

ISCR Case No. 15-05289 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2017). In this case, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s challenged \nconclusion. \nHere, the Judge reasonably found that Applicant has deep personal connections to her \nparents, who live in Belarus, which given current geopolitical circumstances presents a heightened \nrisk, and concluded that Applicant failed to show it is unlikely she will be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between those connections and the interests of the U.S. Applicant has not rebutted \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, nor has she established that the \nJudge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary or capricious. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and \narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record evidence is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

The SOR also alleged that Applicant had failed to timely file his \nstate income returns for tax years 2018, 2020, and 2022, and that he owed his state taxation \nauthority about $19,000 for tax years 2014 through 2018. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the \nallegations but claimed that he had filed all delinquent tax returns and made a payment plan with \nhis state taxation authority. The Judge found that Applicant mitigated the allegations related to the \nstate tax debt and delinquent filings, but that he did not mitigate the concerns alleged with respect \nto Applicant\u2019s federal debt and untimely filings. \nIn September 2022, DoD sent interrogatories to Applicant which asked him in part about his \nfederal and state income taxes. In response, Applicant stated, \u201cI was not in understanding of taxes. I \nhave recently filed all of my back taxes. Currently awaiting my payment plan amount.\u201d Government \nExhibit 3 at 8. About a year-and-a-half later, DoD sent Applicant additional interrogatories asking \nabout the status of his federal and state income tax filings and obligations. In his February 2024 \nresponse, Applicant reported filing federal income tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2021, said \nhe filed for an extension for his 2022 federal tax return, and said he would file it with his 2023 \nincome tax returns. \nThe Judge found that Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2018 in \nspring 2024. Applicant filed his state income tax return for tax year 2020 in June 2025 after the \nhearing but did not document that he filed his federal income tax return for 2020 despite claiming \nthey had been filed during his testimony. Tr. at 36. His 2021 federal and state income tax returns \nwere filed in fall 2022, after receiving an extension. His federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyear 2022 were filed in early 2025. Decision at 3-4. \nApplicant also had related tax delinquencies exceeding $35,000 in federal obligations and \nover $19,000 in state obligations.1 Applicant set up payment plans with both the federal and state \ntaxation authorities. The Judge credited Applicant with a decrease in his state tax debt from $19,139 \nto $16,082 as of April 15, 2025, due to payments made under the plan. In July 2024, Applicant \nentered into a payment agreement for overdue federal taxes for tax years 2015, 2018, and 2021. At \nthat time, the balance due was $11,761 and Applicant agreed to monthly payments of $250 to be \nmade through June 2029. The record does not reflect any payments made under that agreement. In \nApril 2025, he entered into a new payment agreement for overdue taxes for tax years 2018, 2022, \nand 2023. He authorized a private collection agency to debit his bank account for payments totaling \n$35,400 to be made between April 2025 until January 2035. As of May 20, 2025, he owed at least \n1 Applicant\u2019s failure to pay the additional unalleged income taxes when due were not considered for disqualifying \npurposes but were appropriately considered in evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility and mitigating conduct. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n$35,429 for overdue taxes for 2018, 2022, and 2023. He submitted no evidence of payments made \nunder the April 2025 payment agreement. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions and \nthe Whole-Person Concept. In deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, \nwe will review the decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails \nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nApplicant\u2019s appeal suggests that the Judge made a factual error in his conclusion that \nApplicant \u201cfailed to file a [tax year] 2020 return.\u201d Decision at 7; see also id. at 3. However, this \nallegation of error is without merit. While Applicant testified that all of his past-due federal and \nstate tax returns had been filed, his post-hearing exhibit, with a print date of May 20, 2025, \nreflected \u201cno [federal] tax return filed\u201d for tax year 2020. Applicant Exhibit G. The Judge\u2019s factual \nfindings and conclusions are amply supported by the record, and the Judge did not make a factual \nerror with respect to the 2020 federal income tax filing status. \nTurning to Applicant\u2019s arguments about mitigation, Applicant asserts that he mitigated the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns by filing his delinquent federal and state tax returns and arranging \npayments on his delinquent taxes prior to the hearing. Accordingly, he submits that the Judge erred \nin his findings that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b),2 20(d),3 and 20(g)4 did not provide full mitigation. First, as noted \nabove, Applicant\u2019s claim that he filed his 2020 federal income tax return is unsupported. \nAdditionally, we note the Judge found the two allegations with respect to the unfiled state tax \nreturns and state delinquencies in Applicant\u2019s favor after applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g). \nIn his discussion of AG \u00b6 20(b), the Judge found that Applicant faced some circumstances \nbeyond his control, but that Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances.5 We \ninterpret Applicant\u2019s appeal to suggest that \u201chiring a tax preparer and actively managing his \nfinances\u201d shows responsible action under the circumstances. Appeal Brief at 4. However, \nconsidering Applicant\u2019s broken promises to resolve his delinquent federal income tax filings, his \n2 AG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly reasonably under \nthe circumstances. \n3 AG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n4 AG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed \nand is in compliance with those arrangements. \n5 The Judge credited Applicant with periods of unemployment and underemployment and his partner\u2019s decision to \nmake a downpayment on a luxury sedan for Applicant as circumstances that were largely beyond his control. The \nJudge also noted that \u201chis decision to co-sign the vehicle loan was not.\u201d Decision at 7. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndelay in paying his delinquent state tax obligations, and his lack of documented payments on his \nfederal tax repayment agreements, it was reasonable for the Judge to conclude that Applicant did \nnot act responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe Judge found that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) did not provide full mitigation with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s alleged federal tax debt because \nhe submitted no evidence of payments made under either agreement \n. . . [and e]ven if he had made payments in accordance with the April \n2025 agreement ($150 per month)[,] his repeated failure to pay taxes \nwhen due and the timing of his payment arrangements with the IRS \nare insufficient to support full mitigative credit for compliance with \nhis recent arrangement with the IRS or to support a finding that he \nis adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his overdue federal income \ntaxes. \nDecision at 8. The Board has indicated that the concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a \nperson acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0201 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). The evidence supports the \nJudge\u2019s findings that Applicant is not adhering to any reasonable, good faith effort to resolve his \nfederal tax debt, as he has not demonstrated compliance with his recent federal repayment plans. \nAdditionally, the Judge noted that AG \u00b6 20(g) was \u201cnot established for the unfiled [tax year] 2020 \nfederal income tax return.\u201d Decision at 8. His conclusions that Applicant failed to mitigate the \nconcerns with respect to the federal tax delinquency and unfiled 2020 federal tax return are well \nsupported by the evidence. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at inducing an applicant to \nmeet his or her duty to file tax returns and pay taxes. \u201cRather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJul. 22, 2008). Timing of any corrective action is both relevant and material to that determination. \nWhile Applicant points out that \u201cthe bulk of [Applicant\u2019s] remediation occurred well before the \nhearing\u201d (Appeal Brief at 5), we note that it also occurred after Applicant received two sets of \ninterrogatories and the SOR. Even though Applicant eventually filed \u201cthe bulk\u201d of his federal and \nstate tax income tax returns (excluding his 2020 federal income tax return), made payments on his \nstate tax delinquencies, and made payment arrangements on his $35,000 federal tax delinquency, \nthe Judge was obligated to consider all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to timely file and pay his tax obligations. He did so and conducted a comprehensive analysis \nunder both the mitigating conditions and the Whole-Person Concept. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An \napplicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).

The record supports a conclusion \nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision.

Hogan denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nThe SOR alleged three financial concerns: that Applicant is indebted to the federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $544,500 for tax years 2014, 2015, \n2016, 2018, and 2019 and that the federal government has filed a tax lien against him; that he is \nindebted to his state of residence for approximately $107,600 in delinquent taxes for those same \ntax years and that his state has filed tax liens against him; and that a judgment was entered against \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant in 2019 in the approximate amount of $92,200 and remains unpaid. Under Guideline E, \nthe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his security clearance application (SCA) in failing to \ndisclose his federal and state tax delinquencies. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nGuideline F allegations and denied the falsification allegation. The Judge found adversely to \nApplicant on all allegations. \nApplicant is in his early sixties and the sole owner of a defense contracting company. He \nearned a master\u2019s in business administration. A veteran, Applicant has held a security clearance \nfor over 30 years. Applicant separated from his first wife in 2018, and they divorced in 2021. \nRegarding the Guideline F allegations, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s federal and state tax \nproblems \u201cwere an issue of his own making,\u201d as he had the income but chose not to withhold \nsufficient funds to meet his tax obligation each year. Decision at 8. In finding that no mitigating \nconditions fully apply, the Judge highlighted that Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax debts and his unpaid \njudgment debt are ongoing, that he ignored his tax problems for years, that no payment plans are \nyet in place, and that, during the years that Applicant incurred these debts, he traveled \ninternationally and bought a home for over $1 million. Under Guideline E, the Judge found that \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent federal and state tax debts on his SCA. She \nrejected Applicant\u2019s explanation that he was confused by the question as not credible in light of \nseveral factors, including that Applicant is highly educated, owns his own defense contracting \nbusiness, and has held a security clearance for over 30 years. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed \u201cto consider a critical piece of \nexculpatory evidence,\u201d the February 2021 marital separation agreement between Applicant and \nhis first wife, under which the parties agreed that \u201cHusband shall be solely responsible for the \noutstanding balances of these [federal and state] tax debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1; Applicant Exhibit \nA at 7. Applicant argues that the Judge ignored the fact that \u201cthe obligation was a marital debt later \nassumed voluntarily by the Applicant\u201d and that \u201cits voluntary assumption should be viewed as a \nresponsible act rather than a sign of financial irresponsibility.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. \nTo the extent that we understand this argument, we find it frivolous. At hearing, Applicant \naffirmed that he is \u201cindividually responsible for the taxes\u201d under the separation agreement. \nTranscript at 81. Regardless, the Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions remain equally valid even were \nApplicant instead jointly liable for these tax delinquencies. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the \nJudge did not find that Applicant acted irresponsibly in assuming the tax debt. Instead, she found \nthat he acted irresponsibly in accruing delinquent tax debt of over $650,000, highlighting that he \nneglected to pay his federal and state income taxes for more than three years before his marital \nseparation and that he \u201ccontinues to withhold insufficient funds to pay his federal and state income \ntaxes even though his accountant advised him to do this years ago.\u201d Decision at 9. None of \nApplicant\u2019s argument are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record. E.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nConclusion \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of \ndemonstrating that the judge committed factual or legal error. See ISCR Case No. 00-0050 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2001). Applicant has not met this burden.

Zaid, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 19, 2023, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July 5, 2024, the \nGovernment amended the SOR in its entirety.1 On March 14, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan granted Applicant national security eligibility. \nThe Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n1 Unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to the SOR and its allegations are to the amended SOR. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nBackground \nApplicant is in his early thirties. In 2010, when he was 17 years old and in high school, he \nwas granted national security eligibility with SCI access for a work study program with another \ngovernment agency (AGA), which required him to undergo a polygraph examination. It was during \nthe polygraph pre-test interview that Applicant first discussed pornography. He disclosed \naccessing pornographic images and video via two specific websites, including Website A.2 \nAccording to the polygrapher\u2019s report, Applicant expressed concern that, since 2008, he had \ninadvertently viewed no more than 10 images of topless girls, whom he believed were between 15 \nand 17 years old. He also disclosed that he inadvertently watched a 1-minute video of a girl dancing \nand stripping to full nudity, who he estimated was between 15 and 16 years old. He denied \nintentionally seeking child pornography and stated his intention to stop visiting Website A and the \nother site. The polygrapher noted that Applicant was visibly distressed in response to the topic, as \nindicated by his crying and shaking. \nAfter Applicant graduated from college in May 2015, he began working with a defense \ncontractor and initiated a new investigation for security eligibility, which was granted with SCI \naccess in about January 2016.3 Subsequently, and separate from his defense contractor position, \nApplicant sought a new position with AGA in about 2017, which required him to undergo another \npolygraph examination in September and November 2017.4 He was approximately 24 years old at \nthe time. \nDuring the September 2017 pre-test interview, Applicant volunteered that on four or five \noccasions since 2015, while he was viewing adult pornography on unrecalled websites, he saw \nbanners that depicted certain acts of bestiality. Applicant denied having searched for the material, \nand asserted that banners unexpectedly popped up, displaying the material from four to ten seconds \nbefore he \u201cscrolled past them.\u201d5 He affirmatively expressed surprise that the banners popped up \nbecause he had installed advertisement blockers on his computer about one-and-a-half years prior. \nDuring the subsequent November 2017 pre-test interview, Applicant acknowledged that, \nbeginning in 2007 or 2008, he intentionally sought bestiality pornography via Website A. He \ninitially stated that he last sought the content in 2014; however, after additional questioning, he \nreported that he last sought the content earlier that same year, in 2017. He estimated viewing a \ntotal of 10 to 20 videos of this content and acknowledged masturbating on each occasion. He also \nacknowledged that he previously withheld the information because he was embarrassed.6 \nApplicant was also questioned about other pornography and disclosed that, beginning in \n2007 or 2008 and continuing until as recently as three-to-six months prior to the interview, he had \nviewed between 10 and 50 images and videos of \u201csoftcore\u201d underage pornography via Website A \n2 Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 3. \n3 Tr. at 74-75; GE 1 at 35. \n4 Tr. at 75-76. \n5 GE 3 at 4. \n6 GE 4 at 2. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand another site. He believed the females were between 14 or 15 and 17 years old. According to \nthe polygrapher\u2019s report, Applicant believed the females were underage because of their small \nfaces and braces and because the environment of the content was indicative of an underage female.7 \nApplicant further disclosed that, on approximately 20 occasions since about 2015 and \ncontinuing to about one month prior to the interview, he also visited Website A to download \npictures of fully clothed females that were posted to the site by other individuals. Applicant \nbelieved the females were high school aged, between 14 or 15 and 17 years old. According to the \npolygrapher\u2019s report, Applicant again believed the females were underage because of their small \nfaces and braces.8 \nAdditionally, Applicant disclosed that he had pirated over 1.5 terabytes of pornography to \nexternal hard drives, some of which originated from Website A. Most of the material was illegally \ndownloaded from Website B, which Applicant described as a private group for pornography \nrequiring users to sign up for an account. Applicant created a fake name and email for his account, \nand he stated that he used Website B because it was not easily traceable by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. While Applicant averred that the hard drive contained adult pornography, he was \nuncertain if the drive still housed the underage pornography or if he deleted it.9 \nApplicant initiated a new eligibility investigation in 2021 and, during his July 2022 \nbackground interview, asserted that he never illegally downloaded or viewed child pornography. \nBased on the foregoing information, the SOR alleged concerns under Guidelines D, J, and \nE. In his July 2024 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to viewing pornographic images and \nvideo between 2007 and 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 3.a), and to downloading pictures of females \nposted online by others between 2015 and 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 3.a), but he denied that any of the \nmaterial depicted underage individuals. Applicant also admitted having sought bestiality \npornography beginning in 2007 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 3.a), but he claimed that it ceased in 2015. He also \nadmitted having maintained over 1.5 terabytes of pornography on an external hard drive, most of \nwhich was illegally downloaded from Website B because it was not easily traceable by the FBI \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 3.a). Applicant averred that he discontinued both consuming bestiality and illegally \ndownloading pornography in 2017. Turning to the falsification allegations, Applicant denied \nhaving lied about viewing underage pornography during his July 2022 interview (SOR \u00b6 3.b) on \nthe basis that he had \u201cnever downloaded or viewed actual child pornography.\u201d10 He averred that \nhe had no concrete basis to believe that he ever viewed underage pornography, and any contrary \nstatements he made during prior investigations were purely speculative. Finally, Applicant \nadmitted that, during the September 2017 polygraph interview, he did not disclose that he had \n\u201csearched out bestiality pornography\u201d (SOR \u00b6 3.c) but denied the resulting \u201cinsinuation that [he] \nhad concealed the fact that [he] viewed bestiality pornography,\u201d which he did disclose.11 \n7 Id. at 1. \n8 Id. \n9 Id. \n10 SOR Response at 4. \n11 Id. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nScope of Review \nOn appeal, the Board does not review a case de novo, but rather addresses material issues \nraised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. When a judge\u2019s factual \nfindings are challenged, the Board must determine whether the \u201cfindings of fact are supported by \nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in \nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nWhen a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary \nor capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nWhen an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board\u2019s scope of review is plenary. See \nDISCR OSD Case No. 87-2107, 1992 WL 388439 at *3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 1992) (citations to \nfederal cases omitted). If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board \nmust consider the following questions: (1) Is the error harmful or harmless?; (2) Has the \nnonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on \nalternate grounds?; and (3) If the judge\u2019s decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed \nor remanded? See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 2 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004). \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge made certain harmful factual errors and \nthat her application of the mitigating conditions and analysis under the Whole-Person Concept \nwere arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the record evidence. For the following reasons, \nwe reverse the Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConflicting Evidence and Credibility Determination \nUnderlying all claims of error raised on appeal is the Government\u2019s argument that the \nJudge afforded Applicant a favorable credibility assessment despite significant conflicting record \nevidence, without sufficient explanation and, in some instances, without addressing the \nunfavorable evidence at all. These arguments have merit. \nAlthough a judge is not required to discuss every piece of record evidence, she \u201ccannot \nignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person could \nexpect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-03250 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). Furthermore, when conflicts exist within the record, a judge must \nweigh the evidence and resolve such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as \nthe evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05\u00ad\n06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). The record in this case contains multiple evidentiary conflicts \nthat, though all were resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor, went unaddressed in the decision. As discussed, \nbelow, the Judge\u2019s failure to identify significant unfavorable record evidence or sufficiently \nevaluate its comparative reliability with Applicant\u2019s favorable post-SOR explanations was error. \nPre-Polygraph Interviews \nOnly after receiving the original SOR did Applicant first suggest that his disclosures of \nhaving consumed underage pornography were the result of high-pressure polygraph interviews \nand aggressive polygrapher tactics.12 He did not deny having made the statements recorded from \nthose interviews but contended that they were false admissions. \nAn applicant\u2019s polygraph admissions carry evidentiary weight and are due enhanced \ncredibility when against the applicant\u2019s interest.13 Accordingly, recantations of such admissions \nmust be supported by persuasive evidence to overcome their significance.14 In support of his \nrecantations, Applicant offered only his own recollection that the polygraphers\u2019 interview tactics \nwere aggressive, describing that they focused intensely on the topic and asked repeated questions \nto identify details such as ages and numbers of occurrences. \nThe Judge credited Applicant\u2019s explanation, finding that he \u201chas consistently denied that \nhe deliberately illegally downloaded or viewed child pornography\u201d and that, while he had no proof \n12 See, e.g., Applicant Exhibit (AE) A at 1 (\u201c[T]he polygraph examiner really leaned on the child pornography \nallegations and it got to the point that I was crying and I was very upset and I wanted it to end and I felt trapped and \njust started to go along with what she said.\u201d); id. at 5 (\u201cThe examiner was drilling me for ages and numbers.

ISCR Case No. 07-10158 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2008). Here, the Judge\u2019s failure to explain how she found Applicant\u2019s explanations credible in \nlight of his polygraph admissions and other record evidence that detracts from his candor and \ntrustworthiness was error. 15 \nPsychological Evaluation \nIn January 2024, in between submitting his responses to the original and amended SORs, \nApplicant participated in a psychological evaluation with Dr. E, a Board-Certified Psychologist. \nThe Judge appears to have given great weight to Dr. E\u2019s evaluation, the favorable elements of \nwhich were summarized over two pages of factual findings, and she relied upon his favorable \nprognosis and conclusion in finding mitigation of the Guideline D concern.16 The Judge failed, \nhowever, to acknowledge relevant inconsistent information provided during the evaluations. \nFor example, Applicant described that, during the 2017 pre-polygraph interview, he \n\u201csnapped under pressure\u201d and \u201cdid admit to accidently seeing something that [he] thought might \nbe child porn and [he] reported it to the FBI through the anonymous report link on their web site.\u201d17 \nContrary to this statement, there is no information in the interview reports that Applicant ever \ndisclosed reporting child pornography to the FBI, and his suggestion that this \u201caccidental\u201d viewing \noccurred once (leading to the alleged FBI reporting) dramatically varies from the 10-to-50 \ninstances of viewing underage pornography that Applicant admitted during the interview. \nRegarding the allegation about downloading approximately 20 images of fully clothed \nunderage girls, Applicant stated, \u201cI scrolled past something and saw clothed images of younger \n15 Additionally, applicants are held to the standard expected of a reasonable person in the same or similar \ncircumstances. See ISCR Case No. 10-08257 at 3. Even assuming, arguendo, that a reasonable 17-year-old may have \nbeen so flustered by an intense polygraph interview that he falsely admitted conduct, the same concession is much \nharder to afford to a reasonable 24-year-old college graduate who is experienced in the national security eligibility \nprocess and has undergone multiple prior polygraph examinations. \n16 AG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of treatment, or is currently enrolled \nin one, has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a favorable \nprognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nThe Judge concluded that the condition applied \u201cbecause Dr. E., a licensed clinical psychologist, assessed Applicant \nand gave him a good prognosis. He concluded that Applicant did not exhibit any symptoms associated with paraphilic \ndisorder or pedophilia. His prognosis for continued well-functioning was excellent.\u201d Decision at 13. Because AG \u00b6 \n14(e) requires a finding of \u201c[sexual] behavior [that] is readily controllable with treatment,\u201d and the record is devoid \nof any such finding, the Judge\u2019s application of this condition to the Guideline D concern was erroneous. \n17 AE A at 2. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npeople, but scrolled past it. I have no idea how old they were.\u201d18 This explanation to Dr. E suggests \nthat Applicant\u2019s contact with the material was accidental and he quickly passed it, which directly \nconflicts with other evidence from both before and after the evaluation. During the November \n2017 interview, Applicant admitted that he specifically visited Website A to download pictures of \nfully clothed females, whom he estimated were between 14 and 17 years old due to their physical \nattributes. At the December 2024 hearing, in response to why he downloaded pictures of these \nfully clothed females to his computer, Applicant responded, \u201cProbably to admire them in a similar \naspect that one would any, you know, attractive person of the gender that you\u2019re attracted to.\u201d19 \nThe decision is silent regarding the conflicting, and inarguably false, disclosure made to Dr. E. \nRegarding the allegation about bestiality, Applicant told Dr. E that he visited a site for the \ncontent \u201cwhen [he] was in college\u201d because it \u201cwas such a foreign concept to [him] that somebody \nwould do something with an animal that [he] just went to see what it was,\u201d and stated that \u201c[i]t \nwasn\u2019t arousing.\u201d20 Applicant\u2019s disclosure to Dr. E minimized the duration, frequency, and \npurpose of Applicant\u2019s seeking this content, which at other points he described as having occurred \nbeginning in 2007 (when he was about 14 years old), as recently as early 2017 (when he was about \n24 years old), and resulted in his masturbating to the content. \nIn summary, the record reflects that Applicant repeatedly mischaracterized the nature and \nextent of his involvement with pornography during the evaluation, contradicting many of the \nadmissions he made not only during polygraph interviews, but also in his SOR response and at \nhearing. This behavior is additional \u2013 and quite recent \u2013 evidence of Applicant\u2019s continued failure \nto provide complete and candid information throughout this process. The inconsistencies cast \ndoubt on both Applicant\u2019s credibility and the reliability of the psychologist\u2019s conclusions, which \nwere based on flawed input. The Judge\u2019s failure to grapple with these discrepancies undermines \nher reliance on the evaluation and further detracts from the reasonableness of her favorable \ncredibility determination. \nOther Evidence Impacting Credibility \nAdditional evidence went unaddressed by the Judge that further reflects upon Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, judgment, and reliability, and detracts from a favorable credibility determination. \nFor example, despite experiencing certain physical manifestations in response to the topic of \npornography during his 2010 interview (and, according to Applicant, such extreme mental stress \nthat he falsely admitted to viewing underage pornography), and despite his stated intention at the \ntime to stop visiting Website A, Applicant continued visiting this site for at least seven more years. \nAdditionally, throughout her decision and specifically in her mitigation analysis, the Judge \nfound that Applicant did not continue seeking bestiality pornography or illegally downloading \n18 Id. at 4. \n19 Tr. at 116. \n20 AE A at 5. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \npornography after being granted national security eligibility in 2017.21 Aside from Applicant\u2019s \nSOR response, however, the record does not support that Applicant was granted any eligibility in \n2017. Although he applied for a new job with AGA and underwent polygraphs in 2017, the result \nof that investigation is unclear from the record. Rather, as discussed above, Applicant was granted \neligibility and SCI access in January 2016 while working for a defense contractor. \nThe record is therefore clear that Applicant engaged in certain security-significant conduct, \nthat even he admits included illegally downloading pirated pornography through a website \nintentionally selected to evade FBI detection, for nearly two years while granted national security \neligibility. This conduct warranted discussion in terms of its relevance under Guidelines J and E, \nwhere ongoing behavior inconsistent with national security responsibilities is highly probative, \nand the Whole-Person Concept. \nThe Judge erred in failing to acknowledge and weigh this large body of conflicting \nevidence, which impacted upon her credibility assessment and, as a result, her analysis of the SOR \nconcerns. \nFalsifications Under Guideline E \nThe Directive is clear that an applicant\u2019s failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring a national security investigation is of special concern and the refusal to provide full, frank, \nand truthful answers will normally result in an unfavorable determination.

In cases \ninvolving the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of material information, an \napplicant has a \u201cheavy burden in demonstrating evidence of reform, rehabilitation, or changed \ncircumstances sufficient to justify a conclusion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd.

Aug. 3, 1998). On appeal, the Government \nargues that it \u201cestablished by substantial evidence that Applicant repeatedly and illegally viewed \nchild pornography between 2008 through at least 2017, including while he held a security \nclearance\u201d and that the Judge\u2019s \u201cfavorable findings on this critical issue and the resultant finding \nthat he did not lie to the DoD investigator in July 2022 are unsustainable, and her significant \nreliance upon them throughout the Decision constituted harmful error.\u201d Appeal Brief at 17, 23. \nThis argument has merit. \nNational security applicants are required to provide full, frank, and truthful disclosures \nthroughout the investigation and adjudication processes. Directive \u00b6 6.2. The obligation for candor \nduring this process is at the heart of Guideline E. AG \u00b6 15 (\u201cOf special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes.). \nDespite having discussed such conduct during multiple polygraph interviews in which the \ntopic of underage pornography was central, when asked during the July 2022 background \ninterview about the same topic, Applicant apparently concisely asserted that he has never illegally \ndownloaded or viewed any child pornography. Putting aside the veracity of the polygraph \nadmissions themselves and even assuming most favorably for Applicant that \u201cno\u201d was a \ntechnically correct response to the specific question, it was not a full, frank, and candid response \nto the topic. A deliberate omission, though potentially distinguishable from a falsehood, can serve \nto impede the search for truth and thereby interfere with the integrity of the national security \nprocess.22 Applicant\u2019s incomplete response therefore had security significance under Guideline E \nindependent from the underlying conduct, and the Judge\u2019s finding that the Government failed to \nmake a prima facie case for this allegation was in error. A person holding a security clearance has \na duty to fully disclose conduct of security concern when asked, and the record supports a \nconclusion that Applicant failed in this regard. \nSOR \u00b6 3.c \u2013 Falsification of September 2017 Pre-Polygraph Interview \nAfter finding that Applicant falsified information about his consumption of bestiality \npornography during his September 2017 pre-polygraph interview,23 the Judge went on to find \n22 See ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) (\u201cIf an applicant gives narrowly worded, technically \ncorrect answers to an investigator\u2019s questions, but deliberately fails to tell the investigator the whole truth, then the \napplicant is not providing full, frank and candid answers to the investigator. . . .

The Government argues that the \nJudge erred in applying AG \u00b6 17(c) to this established falsification. We agree. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies when the conduct: 1) is unlikely to recur because it is so minor or \ninfrequent or happened so long ago or under such unique circumstances; and 2) does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Application of this condition \nexplicitly requires a showing that the subject conduct \u2013 here, an intentional falsification \u2013 is \nunlikely to recur. An applicant\u2019s acknowledgement of concerning conduct is an initial step in \ndemonstrating acceptance of responsibility for his actions to support that recurrence is unlikely. \nWhen an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept such responsibility, that failure \u201cis evidence \nthat detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 96-0360 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 25, 1997). Here, the record does not support that Applicant is unlikely to falsify material \ninformation in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s only acknowledgement of having intentionally falsified information in his \nSeptember 2017 interview came after that unsuccessful attempt to conceal the underlying behavior, \nwhich triggered further interviewing in November 2017, at which point he admitted that he \nintentionally withheld the information due to embarrassment. The Judge gave Applicant credit for \nthis eventual disclosure, noting only that, while he \u201cwas not forthcoming during his September \n2017 polygraph interview about searching for bestiality pornography on the internet, he fully \ndisclosed this fact to the polygrapher who conducted the second polygraph test.\u201d Decision at 16. \nFirst, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \u201cfully disclosed\u201d the conduct to the polygrapher during \nthe second interview leaves out that he initially provided further false information by stating that \nthe conduct ceased in 2014. It was only after further questioning that he revealed that the conduct \ncontinued until earlier that same year in 2017. Applicant\u2019s disclosure was not voluntary; it came \nonly after he first tried to conceal the information in September, was caught, tried to minimize the \ninformation in November, and was questioned further. This undercuts the credit afforded to the \neventual disclosure and contributes to the concerns about his willingness to voluntarily disclose \nsecurity-significant conduct. \nSignificantly, Applicant has never again acknowledged that his September 2017 \nfalsification was an intentional concealment but has instead, throughout the entirety of this \nadjudication, consistently and flatly denied having intentionally concealed the information in \nSeptember. For example, in response to the SOR, Applicant stated: \nI admit I did not disclose during my September 1, 2017, polygraph \nexamination that I had searched out bestiality pornography. I deny \nthe insinuation that I had concealed the fact that I had viewed \nbestiality pornography, as I disclosed that I had in the September 1, \n2017, polygraph examination.24 \n24 SOR Response at 4. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant seems to suggest that his volunteering some sort of information about bestiality \nduring his September 2017 interview is evidence that he was not trying to conceal the information. \nThis argument carries no weight considering that the information he disclosed was patently false \nin terms of timeframe, frequency, and his active participation. \nAt hearing, regarding whether he felt disappointed in himself after the September interview \nfor having not told the truth about bestiality pornography, he responded, \u201cThe thought didn\u2019t really \ncross my mind. I answered the questions that were asked of me. They didn\u2019t probe too deeply into \nthe bestiality portion.\u201d25 He affirmatively averred, \u201cI had resolved to tell the truth at every \npolygraph I\u2019ve entered.\u201d26 \nIn summary, despite admitting during the November interview that he actively withheld \nthe information about bestiality during his interview in September, Applicant has subsequently \nand consistently denied having intentionally concealed the information. The Judge did not address \nApplicant\u2019s continued failure to admit and take responsibility for the established falsification, \nwhich leads to AG \u00b6 17(c) failing at the outset due to the required showing that the conduct is \nunlikely to recur. 27 Considering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s mitigation of this concern \nthrough AG \u00b6 17(c) is not sustainable. \nGuideline D and Guideline J \nApplicant\u2019s repeated failure to provide full and candid information during multiple national \nsecurity investigations and adjudications fatally undermines the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility \ndetermination. Absent the falsifications and material omissions addressed, above, the underlying \nconduct as alleged in the SOR could arguably have been mitigated by the passage of time. \nApplicant\u2019s continued dishonesty, however, raises questions about whether he has ever been \ncompletely candid about the nature, duration, or cessation of any of the conduct alleged in the \nSOR. Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s reliance on the unexplained and unsupported credibility \ndetermination renders the resultant favorable findings under Guidelines D and J unsustainable. \nConclusion \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. Such is the case when, after \naddressing the identified error, the Board concludes that a contrary formal finding or overall grant \n25 Tr. at 110. Indeed, Applicant\u2019s tendency to not fully disclose information and only answer the very specific questions \nasked of him is a sentiment evidenced throughout the record, and it calls into question his willingness or ability to \nvolunteer security significant information in the context of having access to classified information. \n26 Id. \n27 Moreover, Applicant misled Dr. E about his involvement with bestiality pornography in January 2024 when he \nminimized the nature, duration, and intent of his conduct. This evidence does more than undercut a finding that \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications are unlikely to recur \u2013 it reflects that further falsifications during the national security process \nare likely. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor denial of security clearance eligibility is the clear outcome based on the record.

The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nBy decision issued December 18, 2024, the Appeal Board determined that the Judge erred \nin two regards: 1) in failing to consider an important aspect of the case; and 2) in concluding that \nthe Government did not establish any disqualifying conditions. Remand Order at 5\u20136. We \nremanded the case for correction of the identified errors, noting that it may be necessary to reopen \nthe record to explore unresolved factual and legal questions. Id. at 6, fn. 8. Upon remand, the case \nwas transferred to Administrative Judge Mark Harvey, who held a second hearing on February 4, \n2025.

In the Remand Decision, Judge Harvey determined that the Government had \nestablished its prima facie case, that Applicant had mitigated the alleged state income tax debt, \nand that he had not yet mitigated the security concerns raised by his federal income tax debts. \nApplicant was represented at the initial hearing, on Government appeal of the favorable \ndecision, and at the second hearing. Now pro se, Applicant on appeal alleges no specific errors by \nJudge Harvey in his findings or conclusions. Instead, Applicant requests that the initial decision \nby Judge Benson be \u201creinstated.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. In support of this request, Applicant re-submits \nhis counsel\u2019s Reply Brief from the Government\u2019s initial appeal in a different format, which argues \nfor affirming the original favorable decision. Id. at 1\u20138. Reinstatement of the original decision, \nhowever, is not a remedy available at this juncture, as a remanded decision is vacated and becomes \na legal nullity. E.g., ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2022).    \nIn addition to arguing for reinstatement of Judge Benson\u2019s favorable decision, Applicant \nalso challenges Department Counsel\u2019s presentation of the case both in the Government\u2019s initial \nappeal brief and at the second hearing. Appeal Brief at 10\u201311. Although the Board has no \nsupervisory authority over Department Counsel, the Board can review claims that the conduct of \nDepartment Counsel violated or prejudiced an applicant\u2019s rights under Executive Order 10865 or \nthe Directive. ISCR Case No. 02-04344 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2003). Upon review of Applicant\u2019s \nbrief and the record, we conclude that Applicant has not established a prima facie case of any such \nviolation. Finally, in his sole allegation of error by Judge Harvey, Applicant makes a broad \nassertion that the Judge \u201cdid not take into account the \u2018whole person\u2019 concept that is part of the \nprocess.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. This argument simply advocates for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions \nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions upon remand were arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. In the instant case, the Judge examined the relevant evidence, \nweighed the disqualifying and mitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are \nsustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Conflicting Evidence The Government\u2019s argument that the Judge afforded undue weight to Applicant\u2019s 2024 psychological evaluation despite significant conflicting record evidence, without addressing the conflicting evidence at all, underlies the majority of claims of error raised on appeal. These arguments have merit. 5 Although a judge is not required to discuss every piece of record evidence, he \u201ccannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). Furthermore, when conflicts exist within the record, a judge must weigh the evidence and resolve such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05\u00ad 06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). A judge is neither compelled to accept a psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. Rather, the judge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding what weight to give an expert opinion. See ISCR Case No. 19-00151 at 8 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019).

She was honorably discharged in 2023. Applicant was first \ngranted a security clearance in June 2019 in connection with her military service. \nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, Applicant was residing alone in an off-base \napartment due to structural problems in the barracks. She felt lonely and isolated. She had just \nrelocated cross-country when the pandemic began, and this was the first time she lived far from \nhome. She began drinking alcohol to pass the time. \nBy June 2020, Applicant was consuming an average of a bottle of wine per night. On July 4, \n2020, Applicant invited several friends to her apartment to drink alcohol. Subsequently, she drank \nto the point where she vomited and blacked out. She decided to stop consuming alcohol after \nrealizing that she was consuming too much, but began experiencing memory loss, anxiety, and \ninsomnia. By July 9, 2020, she was having auditory and visual hallucinations, prompting her to check \ninto the hospital. While at the hospital, she was evaluated and diagnosed with delirium tremens and \nalcohol use disorder, moderate. She endorsed auditory hallucinations, delusions, agitation, anxiety, and \ntremors. On July 14, 2020, she was transferred to a residential treatment facility where she received \ninpatient treatment for 30 days. From August 14 to October 23, 2020, she attended outpatient \nsubstance abuse disorder (SUD) treatment consisting of weekly individual sessions, attendance of \nPrime for Life alcohol and drug education, was subject to random urinalysis testing, and was \nrequired to abstain from alcohol use. She was released from treatment due to pregnancy and her \ncommitment to have a healthy baby. \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 hospitalization triggered a Security Access Eligibility Report and the \nDoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility requested Applicant receive a medical evaluation due to \nher alcohol use. In April 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist and diagnosed \nwith alcohol-use disorder, moderate, in early remission. During the evaluation, Applicant \nhypothesized the alcohol had little to do with her inability to sleep and reported she also had an \near infection and a urinary tract infection causing her too much pain to sleep.

The evaluator concluded that \nshe lacked insight and did not appear to be aware of how her problematic alcohol use contributed \nto her July 2020 hospitalization. The psychologist concluded: \nDuring this interview [Applicant] demonstrated questionable judgment and \nreliability, particularly through her evasive and unreliable reporting of facts that \nwere already established in her [military] medical record. [Applicant] lacks insight, \nand she appeared bothered that the military requires evaluating someone\u2019s \nclearance if they use alcohol and receive treatment; especially if it was voluntary \ntreatment like in her case.

She expressed a \ndesire to commit suicide after consuming two bottles of wine and her boyfriend took her to the clinic \nfor help. After going to the hospital emergency room, she was transferred to the behavioral health \nunit. After meeting with a counselor, she was discharged. \nIn August 2021, Applicant self-admitted into a hospital after attempting to kill herself by \ndrinking a bottle of wine and taking nine sleeping pills. Applicant was experiencing postpartum \ndepression. These feelings were magnified when her boyfriend, the father of the child, moved out \nof their home shortly before the birth of the baby. At the hospital, she received crisis intervention \ntherapy and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD), moderate, and depressive disorder. \nUpon discharge, she began attending therapy, as recommended, once per week, and she was \nprescribed a medication for depression as well as a medication to control her alcohol consumption. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR-1 is dated September 8, 2021.

Applicant then completed another 30-day inpatient alcohol rehabilitation, \nfollowed by a six-week, intensive outpatient program, and then began attending weekly outpatient \nindividual therapy. While hospitalized, both of Applicant\u2019s anti-depressant medications and her \nmedication to prevent alcohol consumption were adjusted. Applicant felt that the adjustments were \neffective. She was discharged from SUD on April 19, 2023. Answer to SOR-2 at 4, Enc. 1. \nAs part of her treatment, Applicant was required to attend Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) \nclasses daily for 90 days.

She stated that this was followed by a 6-week intensive outpatient \nprogram, and then weekly outpatient individual therapy. She stated that she also \nstarted attending AA meetings in March of 2022, which she continues to attend on \na monthly basis. Currently, she reported seeing a psychiatrist for medication \nmanagement. She noted that she takes Wellbutrin and Amitriptyline, which have \nbeen helpful. \nId. at 1-2.

In July 2021, a supervisor described her as a \u201chard-charging \nsailor, dedicated to improvement and raising the bar.\u201d Id. at 2 (quoting GE 10 at 34).

See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that \u201ca clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nOn appeal, the Government challenges that the Judge\u2019s analyses under the mitigating \nconditions for Guidelines G and I and the Whole-Person Concept were arbitrary, capricious, and \nnot supported by the record evidence. When a judge\u2019s findings are challenged, we examine them \nto see if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nsame record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. The Board must consider not only whether there is record \nevidence supporting a judge\u2019s findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from \nthe weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the judge\u2019s findings reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2005). A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary or capricious if: it does not examine \nrelevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant \nfactors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it \noffers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so \nimplausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, \n1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm \nMut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). Here, the Decision failed to consider important aspects \nof the case, relied upon erroneous findings of fact, and reached conclusions that ran contrary to the \ntotality of the record. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the Judge\u2019s Decision. \nConflicting Evidence \nThe Government\u2019s argument that the Judge afforded undue weight to Applicant\u2019s 2024 \npsychological evaluation despite significant conflicting record evidence, without addressing the \nconflicting evidence at all, underlies the majority of claims of error raised on appeal. These \narguments have merit. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough a judge is not required to discuss every piece of record evidence, he \u201ccannot \nignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person could \nexpect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-03250 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). Furthermore, when conflicts exist within the record, a judge must \nweigh the evidence and resolve such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as \nthe evidence\u2019s \u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05\u00ad\n06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). A judge is neither compelled to accept a psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. Rather, the judge has to \nconsider the record evidence as a whole in deciding what weight to give an expert opinion. See \nISCR Case No. 19-00151 at 8 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019). A diagnosis may be undercut by \ninaccurate or incomplete information. \nThe Government asserts that the March 2024 psychological evaluation, which the Judge \nrelied upon heavily in his mitigating and Whole-Person analyses, relied upon multiple \ninaccuracies. The report of the evaluation lacks a complete history of Applicant\u2019s alcohol \ndependence, suicide attempts, and history of hospitalization. While the report identified \nApplicant\u2019s hospitalization in July 2020 and suicide attempts in September 2021 and January 2022, \nit omitted any mention of the July 2021 and August 2021 suicide attempts. The evaluator also \nnoted that Applicant continued to attend AA monthly and that she \u201ctakes Wellbutrin and \nAmitriptyline, which have been helpful.\u201d Similarly, in her November 14, 2023 Answer to SOR-2, \nApplicant asserted that, \u201c[I] still continue with AA meetings presently and have maintained my \nsobriety.\u201d However, Applicant testified at hearing that she stopped attending AA in August 2023 \nand discontinued her medications in December 2023. It is also unclear as to whether the psychologist \nhad access to the 2021 evaluation that noted concerns with Applicant\u2019s veracity. We agree that \nthese contradicting or inaccurate statements cast doubt on the reliability of the 2024 psychological \nevaluation and the weight with which the Judge relies on it. The Judge erred in not identifying and \nresolving these conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of the evidence\u2019s comparative reliability \nin light of the inaccuracies. \nCredibility \nNot only do the above inaccuracies cast doubt on the 2024 evaluation, but they also cast \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s credibility when viewed cumulatively with other inconsistencies. When the \nrecord contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility (inconsistent statements, contrary \nrecord evidence, etc.) the judge should address that aspect of the record explicitly, explaining why \nhe or she finds an applicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief. See ISCR Case No. 14\u00ad\n054765 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016). Failure to do so suggests that a judge has merely substituted \na favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence. \nHere, the Judge failed to explain why he found Applicant credible despite contrary record \nevidence. He did not address the 2021 psychologist\u2019s notation that Applicant minimized her \nalcohol use and denied having a problem with alcohol. He did not examine the discrepancy \nbetween her claim in her September 2021 Answer to SOR-1 that she was \u201cin remission\u201d and that \nthere had been \u201cno recurrences since July 4, 2020\u201d in light of the evidence that she relapsed in July \n2021 and in August 2021. Nor did he evaluate her multiple omissions to the psychologist in the \n2024 evaluation. Applicant appears consistent only in that she is an unreliable historian of her \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalcohol use. The Judge erred in failing to weigh these factors as part of his credibility \ndetermination. \nGuideline G and I Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s repeated failure to provide full and candid information undermines the Judge\u2019s \nfavorable credibility determination. Absent the material omissions and inconsistencies addressed \nabove, the underlying conduct alleged in the SOR could arguably have been mitigated by the \npassage of time, her abstinence, and favorable prognosis after treatment. However, Applicant\u2019s \ninaccuracies and omissions raise questions about whether she has ever been completely candid \nwith the Government about the nature, duration, or cessation of her alcohol consumption. \nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s reliance on the unexplained and unsupported credibility determination \nrenders the resultant favorable findings under Guidelines G and I and the Whole-Person Concept \nunsustainable. \nConclusion \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The former is appropriate when the legal errors can be \ncorrected through remand and there is a significant chance of reaching a different result upon \ncorrection, such as when a judge fails to consider relevant and material evidence. If the identified \nerrors cannot be remedied on remand, the decision must be reversed. Such is the case when, after \naddressing the identified error, the Board concludes that a contrary formal finding or overall grant \nor denial of national security eligibility is the clear outcome based on the record. ISCR Case No. \n22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2024) (citation omitted). \nThe Government has met its burden on appeal of demonstrating reversible error below. \nConsidering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious as it fails to \nexamine relevant evidence and important aspects of the case, fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for material conclusions, and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. \nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable under Egan. After addressing the \nidentified errors, the Board concludes that a denial of national security eligibility is the clear \noutcome based on the record and the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is reversed. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-01853 is REVERSED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nGrant Couch, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 7, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On March 18, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant national security \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant, in his mid-60s, is twice married and divorced and has two adult children. He \nwas previously granted national security eligibility in 1984. Applicant has been employed as a \nsenior data architect with a federal contractor since January 2021. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s drug involvement, \nincluding marijuana use from 2014 to about September 2022, cocaine use from 2015 to about June \n2022, and purchases of both drugs during those respective periods.

On appeal, Applicant challenges this finding and asserts \nthat he did provide a negative test result for cannabis from September 2024, a copy of which was \nattached to his appeal for reference. \nThe record reflects that, prior to the hearing, Applicant submitted a series of results from \ndrug tests administered on September 9, 2024, which were cumulatively marked Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit C. The documents were identified on the record at hearing and described as consisting of \nsix pages of results for \u201camphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, phencyclidine and \ncocaine all dated September 9th, 2024, all indicating negative drug tests.\u201d Tr. at 9. Applicant \nacknowledged having submitted the documents prior to the hearing and, following their \nidentification for the record, did not contend that the exhibit was missing a test result for marijuana \nor otherwise incomplete. The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant did not submit a September 2024 test \nresult for marijuana is supported by the record. \nWe note that the negative cannabis test result submitted with Applicant\u2019s appeal appears \nto have been from the same series of tests included at Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C; however, this \ndocument constitutes new evidence, which the Board may not consider. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. Even \nif the Board could consider the new evidence, it would not impact our review of this case. \nGuideline E \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge found that AG \u00b6 16(a) was established, noting Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations that he read the SCA\u2019s drug involvement questions hastily and misinterpreted them, \nbelieving \u201cuse\u201d of a drug meant \u201caddicted,\u201d which he claimed to not be.

The \nJudge went on to find AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c)1 not fully mitigating because \u201cApplicant did not try \nto correct his omissions until he was confronted with the evidence by a security investigator,\u201d and \nthe falsification was recent and significant. Id. at 7 (citing ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. \nAug. 8, 2011) (Falsification of an SCA \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d)). \nOn appeal, Applicant does not directly challenge the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he \nintentionally falsified his SCA.2 Rather, he challenges the Judge\u2019s failure to apply mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 17(a) by reiterating his explanation that the omission was due to his hastily \ncompleting the SCA and misunderstanding the relevant Drug Use question. Applicant\u2019s argument \nfor application of AG \u00b6 17(a) implies a challenge to the Judge\u2019s disqualification analysis and his \nunderlying finding of intentional falsification. This challenge, however, is unpersuasive. \nThe record reflects the following information about Applicant\u2019s drug use history \ndisclosures. In 2015 and 2016 applications completed prior to his current eligibility process, \nApplicant answered negatively in response to questions seeking information about illegal drug use \nin the prior year. Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 21; GE 3 at 11. In his May 2022 SCA, as part of \nhis current eligibility investigation, he again disclosed no illegal drug activity, this time within the \nprior seven years. GE 1 at 40.3 As addressed below, Applicant subsequently participated in a series \nof interviews with an authorized DoD investigator, and he adopted the resulting reports as \naccurately reflecting the information he provided during each. \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana and cocaine use for the first time during his interview in \nAugust 2022. He explained that he used marijuana from 2014 to June 2022, smoking the drug with \na bong to alleviate complications from colon cancer, and that he \u201cwould obtain marijuana \nrandomly on the street until 2020 when marijuana was legalized\u201d in his residential area. GE 4 at \n25. Applicant asserted that he stopped smoking marijuana because it negatively interfered with his \nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), but that he was working with his doctor to \nidentify a way to ingest it instead. \nUpon further questioning, Applicant also disclosed that he used cocaine about six times \nper year from 2015 to December 2021, and that he would \u201crandomly purchase [the drug] off the \nstreets . . . from a random person.\u201d Id. He explained that he started using cocaine when he was 18 \nand identified being addicted to it as a young man but averred that he \u201cgot clean\u201d and remained so \nuntil 2015. Applicant acknowledged hiding the cocaine use from his former spouse. Applicant \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts; and 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n2 AG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities. \n3 Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances? \nUse of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or \notherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance.\u201d Id. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninitially explained that he omitted the drug use from his 2022 SCA because he misinterpreted the \nquestion but, when pressed about what specifically he misinterpreted, Applicant asserted that he \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the questions in haste. \nApplicant participated in another interview in September 2022 and explained that, while \nhe used both marijuana and cocaine recreationally when he was younger, his latest period of use \nwas for self-medicating, and he averred that he was not addicted to cocaine. He reiterated that he \npurchased both drugs \u201cillegally on the streets and from friends,\u201d and also explained his 2022 SCA \nomission by stating that he \u201cglossed over the questions on his [SCA] and associated them only \nwith being arrested.\u201d GE 4 at 37. \nDuring a triggered follow-up interview in January 2023, Applicant was confronted with \ninformation that his last use of cocaine occurred in June 2022, not December 2021 as reported \nduring an earlier interview. Applicant responded that he did not recall using the drug in June 2022, \nbut that the June 2022 date \u201ccould be true as [he] does not count relapses as being the last time he \nused,\u201d and it was \u201cfair to say [he] had a relapse in June 2022 as it is a life struggle for [him] as an \naddict to possibly have a relapse.\u201d Id. at 31. Applicant also updated his last marijuana use to have \noccurred in September 2022, not July 2022 as previously asserted, but noted that he is \u201cnot good \nwith dates.\u201d Id. at 32. Several days later, Applicant expressed confidence that he last used \nmarijuana in either July or August 2022 and equivocated about whether he last used cocaine in \nDecember 2021 or June 2022. Id. at 40. \nAt hearing, Applicant provided information that varied wildly from that provided during \nhis various interviews. He estimated that he last used marijuana in 2016 and averred that it was \ncigarettes that he stopped smoking after being diagnosed with COPD in 2022. Tr. at 28-30. Upon \nfurther questioning, Applicant acknowledged being told when he was diagnosed with COPD that, \nif he continued to smoke marijuana, he \u201cwould have to carry around an oxygen tank.\u201d Id. at 35. \nWhen the questions turned to Applicant\u2019s cocaine use, he initially denied using the drug from 2015 \nto 2022, as alleged in the SOR and admitted in his SOR response, and averred that he stopped \nusing cocaine in 2006. Id. at 37-38. When confronted with his SOR response, however, Applicant \nacknowledged using cocaine \u201cfrom time to time\u201d when visited by an associate. He repeatedly \ndenied purchasing the drug during his latest period of use, explaining instead that his associate \nwould bring it by his house. Id. at 43-44. His denials persisted despite being confronted with his \ninterview summaries \u2013 which Applicant adopted as accurate \u2013 reflecting his volunteered \ninformation that he purchased cocaine off the streets. \nTurning to the Judge\u2019s disqualification analysis, intent to deceive or mislead the \nGovernment can be inferred from circumstantial evidence. See DISCR OSD Case No. 90-0770, \n1992 WL 388309 at *2 (App. Bd. Jul. 16, 1992). Applicant\u2019s explanations for omitting information \nfrom his SCA were relevant \u2013 but not conclusive \u2013 evidence for the Judge to consider in light of \nthe entire record, including the Judge\u2019s assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility. Id. \nIn addition to the inconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s various drug use disclosures, which \nthemselves reflect negatively on his credibility, he also provided inconsistent explanations for \nomitting the information from his 2022 SCA, shifting between that he hurriedly completed the \napplication to that he misunderstood the question \u2013 which is clear on its face \u2013 as only seeking \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about drug addiction or, alternatively, drug arrests. Despite his denial, the record\u2019s \ncircumstantial evidence reflecting Applicant\u2019s truthfulness throughout this process was sufficient \nto support the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant intentionally falsified his 2022 SCA4 \nWe are also unpersuaded by Applicant\u2019s arguments that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) applied \nbecause three years have passed since his SCA omission, and he has since been \u201ccompletely \ntransparent and open regarding his past drug use.\u201d Appeal Brief at 13. Applicant\u2019s suggestion of \nopenness and transparency is contradicted by the shifting details he provided regarding his drug \nuse, which continued throughout his investigation and into his hearing, and the Judge\u2019s \ndetermination that Applicant failed to correct his omission was reasonable. \nThe Directive is clear that an applicant\u2019s failure to respond truthfully and candidly during \na national security investigation is of special concern, specifically stating that the \u201crefusal to \nprovide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials, or \nother official representatives\u201d in connection with an investigation and adjudication will normally \nresult in an unfavorable eligibility determination. AG \u00b6 15. In cases involving the deliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of material information, an applicant has a \u201cheavy burden \nin demonstrating evidence of reform, rehabilitation, or changed circumstances sufficient to justify \na conclusion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). To date, Applicant has \ndeclined to acknowledge any intentionality or wrongdoing in completing his SCA, which detracts \nfrom a finding of reform and rehabilitation.5 The Judge\u2019s conclusion that AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply is amply supported by the record. \nGuideline H \nThe Judge concluded that none of the Guideline H mitigating conditions applied, citing \nthat Applicant\u2019s drug involvement has been recent and frequent, that he has not disassociated from \ndrug users or changed his environment, and that he did not provide a statement of intent against \nfuture drug use. Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis and his failure to apply AG \n\u00b6 26(a), which affords mitigation upon consideration of the recency, frequency, or unusual \ncircumstances of the behavior,6 or AG \u00b6 26(b), which affords mitigation when the individual \nacknowledges his drug involvement, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand establishes a pattern of abstinence. \n4 In his 2022 SCA, Applicant also responded \u201cNo\u201d to \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you been involved in the illegal \npurchase . . . of any drug or controlled substance?\u201d GE 1 at 40. Applicant provided no explanation for how he \nmisunderstood this question considering his acknowledgment that he purchased both cocaine and marijuana \u201coff the \nstreets.\u201d Although the SOR did not specifically allege falsification of this question, it is further circumstantial evidence \nreflective of Applicant\u2019s truthfulness in completing his SCA. \n5 See ISCR Case No. 96-0360 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997) (\u201cWhere an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept \nresponsibility for his or her own actions, such a failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and \nrehabilitation.\u201d). \n6 AG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arguments in this regard, and his remaining arguments on appeal, amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. See ISCR Case No. 96-0376 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 1997) (citing Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. \nDonovan, 452 U.S. 490, 523 (1981)). For example, Applicant contends that the Judge \u201cfailed to \ngive proper weight to the amount of time that has elapsed since [Applicant\u2019s] consumption of \nillegal substances,\u201d which, as of the hearing, included about two and a half years for marijuana \nand about three years for cocaine. Appeal Brief at 6. \nThe Board has never established a bright line rule for what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d drug use, \nand the extent to which security concerns may have become attenuated through the passage of time \nis a question that must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. See ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004). Considering Applicant\u2019s entire history of drug use including self-\ndescribed addiction, his own characterization of his more recent drug use as \u201crelapse,\u201d and his \nconsistent failure to provide truthful and complete responses during this process, the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s drug use was recent and did not occur under unusual circumstances is \nsupported by the record, as is his conclusion that Applicant failed to acknowledge his drug \ninvolvement or demonstrate a sufficient pattern of abstinence to support mitigation.7 \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. Our review of the record confirms that the Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this \nrecord. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with \nthe interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Dept. of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n7 Moreover, regardless of which of Applicant\u2019s reported dates of last using marijuana is accurate \u2013 June, July, August, \nor September 2022 \u2013 the record reflects that he used the drug after submitting his SCA in May 2022 and potentially \nalso continued using after participating in at least one of his interviews. Having acknowledged understanding the \nsecurity significance of marijuana use while granted national security eligibility (see GE 4 at 36), Applicant\u2019s post-\nSCA conduct carries further implications about his judgment and reliability. See ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. \nBd. Sep. 14, 2021) (The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use marijuana after having been placed on \nnotice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those \nwith access to classified information.\u201d). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-01986 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 29, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On January 30, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nRoger C. Wesley denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state \ntax returns for tax years 2014, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022, and that he carried delinquent \ntax balances for various tax years, including approximately $22,000 previously owed to his state \ngovernment and approximately $76,000 still outstanding to the federal government. In response to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations, explaining that the tax returns had been filed, that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstate tax debt had been paid, and that he was working to establish a payment plan to resolve the \noutstanding federal tax debt. Applicant requested that his case be decided based on the written \nrecord and received a complete copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on \nOctober 22, 2024, through which he was notified of his ability to respond with objections or \nadditional information for the Judge to consider. As discussed further, below, Applicant submitted \nthree responses to the FORM between November 21 and December 30, 2024, each time with \nsupporting documentation. \nThe Judge found favorably regarding Applicant\u2019s formerly delinquent state tax balance for \n2020 through 2022 and adversely on the remaining four allegations. Ultimately concluding that it \nis not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility, \nthe Judge noted that \u201cApplicant\u2019s late tax filings and expressed commitments to take care of his \nremaining tax debt delinquency issues in the future, while encouraging, lack the needed \ndocumentation to corroborate his assurances and atone for his past tax-filing and payment lapses.\u201d \nDecision at 6. \nOn appeal, Applicant reiterates his explanation for the tax delinquencies, provides updates \nregarding his financial status, and requests reconsideration of his case. Applicant also provides \nnew documentation reflecting his federal tax payment history and current balance. The Appeal \nBoard does not review cases de novo, and we are generally prohibited from considering new \nevidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. We may, however, consider new evidence insofar as it bears upon \nthreshold issues of due process or jurisdiction. See ISCR Case No. 08-07664 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n29, 2009). Applicant\u2019s appeal brief does not specifically raise a due process issue; however, his \nnew documentation highlights the possibility that evidence was properly submitted but not \nconsidered by the Judge, which is confirmed following our review of the entire record. \nEvidence Not Considered \nAfter receiving the Government\u2019s FORM on October 22, 2024, Applicant submitted the \nfollowing three responses, on November 21, December 17, and December 30, 2024. The Judge \nappears to have considered only the December 17 submission in analyzing the matter, and the \nNovember 21 and December 30 submissions were inadvertently excluded from the hard copy \nrecord. \nOn November 21, 2024, Applicant initially responded to the FORM with further \nexplanation for his tax deficiencies, a character reference letter, and a receipt reflecting two \npayments made towards his federal tax balance on November 21, 2024, including approximately \n$11,900 for tax year 2017 and $8,100 for tax year 2020. See FORM Response at 4. The \nGovernment did not object to this four-page submission, and it was forwarded to the Hearing \nOffice along with the FORM. Although this initial FORM response is included in the electronic \nrecord, it is not in the hard copy record and appears to have been omitted from the Judge\u2019s review.1 \n1 In discussing the evidence, the Judge noted that Applicant \u201cresponded to the FORM (albeit beyond the 30 days \nallowed) with receipts of payments to the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d Decision at 2 (emphasis added). This further \nsupports that the initial FORM response was omitted from the record and consideration, as it was timely submitted. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nOn December 17, 2024, Applicant supplemented his FORM response with an update \nregarding his federal tax balance and documentation reflecting a payment made for $3,366.71 for \ntax year 2020. See Item 7 at 3. This first supplemental response was identified by the Judge as Item \n7 and included in the record. \nOn December 30, 2024, Applicant again supplemented his FORM response with \ndocumentation reflecting a $9,000 federal tax payment made for tax year 2021, as well as federal \nand state tax payments made for tax year 2023. Although this second supplemental FORM \nresponse is included in the electronic record along with the email transmitting it to the Hearing \nOffice on December 30, the two-page submission is not in the hard copy record and appears to \nhave been omitted from the Judge\u2019s review. \nIn calculating Applicant\u2019s current tax balance, the Judge found that \u201cApplicant is indebted \nto the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in excess of $74,000\u201d and that, aside from \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cpayments to the IRS totaling $6,733 (Item 7)[,] he provided no evidence of additional \ntax payments or installment payment plans with the IRS,\u201d which the Judge concluded remained \n\u201cin excess of $68,000.\u201d Decision at 3. The foregoing accounting fails to consider approximately \n$29,000 in federal tax payments that were evidenced in Applicant\u2019s November 21 and December \n30 FORM responses, which omission may have impacted the outcome of the case and therefore \nconstitutes harmful error.2 \nInconsistent Formal Findings \nBecause the case is being remanded to address the foregoing evidentiary error, it bears \nnoting an inconsistency in the Judge\u2019s Formal Findings that is not explained in the decision\u2019s \npreceding analysis. The SOR alleged that Applicant previously owed a delinquent state tax balance \nof approximately $7,500 for tax years 2014 and 2016 through 2019, which remained unpaid until \nabout 2023 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The SOR also alleged that Applicant previously owed a delinquent state \ntax balance of approximately $14,600 for tax years 2020 through 2022, which remained unpaid \nuntil 2024 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Without any explanation why, the Judge found favorably on the second \nallegation but adversely on the first. \nA decision must set forth findings and conclusions with \u201csufficient specificity and clarity \nthat the parties and the Board can discern what the judge is finding and concluding.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 98-0809 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 1999). Here, however, with no clarifying explanation, we \ncannot determine if the difference in formal findings follows a reasonable analysis, reflects a \ntypographical error, or constitutes arbitrary and capricious reasoning. In any event, it should be \nremedied on remand. \n2 See N.L.R.B v. Am. Geri-Care, 697 F.2d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 1982) (remand required where there is a significant chance \nthat, but for the error, a different result might have been reached), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 906 (1983). \nThe Judge\u2019s reference to \u201cpayments to the IRS totaling $6,733\u201d appears to be a double counting of the $3,366.71 \npayment evidenced in Applicant\u2019s November 21 response (Item 7), which inured to Applicant\u2019s benefit; however, that \nbenefit is insufficient to offset the potential impact of the omitted $29,000 in federal tax payments. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nWe conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand it to the Judge to reopen the \nrecord to address the errors identified herein, including considering Applicant\u2019s November 21 and \nDecember 30 FORM responses, and to issue a new decision.

He has worked for the same government contractor since \n2010 and has twice worked in a combat zone: from 2010 to 2011 and again from 2013 to 2014. \nHis employer contracted with an established accounting firm (Firm A) to help Applicant and other \nemployees with tax planning and filing. Based upon Firm A\u2019s advice, Applicant lowered his tax \nwithholdings in anticipation of a foreign income exclusion. Because of a subsequent divorce and \na lengthy child custody dispute, Applicant did not timely file his federal and state returns for \nseveral tax years and forfeited his employer\u2019s benefit of paying for Firm A to file his returns and \nthe necessary documents to claim a foreign income exclusion. \nIn 2019, Applicant hired Firm B to file his late returns for TYs 2012 through 2018. \nApplicant asserts that Firm B was unfamiliar with the foreign income exclusion and did not claim \nthe exclusion on Applicant\u2019s behalf, resulting in the alleged delinquent state and federal taxes. \nLater that same year, Applicant contacted his state tax authority, entered into a payment plan, made \nseveral monthly payments of $450 per month, and later used his COVID-19 stimulus payment of \n$1,200 to further reduce his state tax indebtedness. Applicant elected to address his state tax debt \nbefore his federal tax debt because his state had already garnished his bank account and because \nthe accounting firm advised him that the state was more difficult to work with than the IRS. In \n2020, Applicant\u2019s pay was reduced for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. He could no \nlonger afford the payments to his state tax authority and defaulted on the payment plan. \nIn early 2023, Applicant\u2019s earnings increased, allowing him to again tackle his tax \nindebtedness. In February 2023, Applicant hired Firm C to resolve his delinquent federal taxes. \nFirm C eventually helped Applicant reduce his federal tax obligation from about $21,000 to about \n$6,600, with a monthly payment plan of $255. Applicant began making payments to the IRS in \nOctober 2024 and anticipates the total tax delinquency will be resolved by the end of 2025. This \nremaining federal tax arrearage from TY 2012 of about $6,000 is Applicant\u2019s only current tax debt. \nIn late 2024, Applicant sold his home and used the proceeds to pay the delinquent state taxes \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2020 through 2022 in about February \n2024 and attributed his late filing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicant stated that he has received \na refund of about $1,000 to $2,000 every tax year since 2014. \nApplicant asserted that his financial situation has greatly improved. Other than his \noutstanding federal tax debt for TY 2012, he does not have any delinquent debts. Applicant took \nout a loan for about $15,000 against his retirement savings account to pay the closing costs on the \nhouse and to satisfy a payday loan of about $6,000.

Nevertheless, he concluded that Applicant failed to carry his \nburden of proof to mitigate, as he failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that he acted in good faith: \n[Applicant] did not file the income tax returns for the 2012 through 2018 TYs that \nresulted in his delinquent taxes until 2019. He did not attempt to make a payment \narrangement on his federal tax debt until 2023. While he first attempted to make a \npayment arrangement on his state tax debt in 2019, he did so only after having his \nbank account garnished. After defaulting on his payment arrangement for his \ndelinquent state taxes in 2020 (again for reasons that were arguably beyond his \ncontrol), he did not attempt to address that debt again until early 2024. \nApplicant ultimately resolved his State A tax debt by selling a house that he could \nhave sold years earlier, except that he was delinquent on that mortgage. Although \nfailing to file his income tax returns was a major factor in causing his delinquent \ntaxes, he then did not timely file his federal tax returns for TYs 2020 through 2022. \nFor these reasons, I do not find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances \nor in good faith. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. [Decision at 7.] \nThe Judge recognized the partial application of AG \u00b6 20(g), the individual has made \narrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in \ncompliance with those arrangements, as Applicant has resolved his 2014 federal taxes, his 2014 \nthrough 2018 state taxes, and is current on an IRS payment arrangement for his 2012 federal taxes. \nThe Judge concluded, however, that the application of AG \u00b6 20(g) did not fully resolve the security \nconcerns, in light of the timing of Applicant\u2019s resolution efforts and his additional failure to timely \nfile his 2020 through 2022 federal income tax returns. In conducting his whole-person analysis, the \nJudge considered Applicant\u2019s military service and positive character references, as well as the \n\u201creasonable excuses for why it took him so long to address his tax delinquencies\u201d before concluding \nthat \u201cthose explanations do not adequately justify the length of the delay and leave me with doubts \nabout his judgment and reliability.\u201d Decision at 8. \nDiscussion \nApplicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering \nall of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and Whole-\nPerson Concept. Throughout his brief, Applicant argues that the Judge did not give appropriate \nweight to the unusual circumstances that contributed to the tax delinquencies: the marital trouble, \nthe divorce proceedings, the contentious child custody dispute, and COVID-19. Moreover, \nApplicant argues, the Judge failed to properly consider the progress that Applicant has made in \nresolving the delinquencies: his complete satisfaction of the state tax debt and the federal 2014 \ndelinquency and his compliance with a payment plan for the remaining federal 2012 delinquency. \nAppeal Brief at 5,6.

ISCR Case No. 06-17409 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). The Judge explicitly discussed each of the factors that Applicant \nraises, and he acknowledged that the tax delinquencies arose in part due to circumstances beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. In concluding that no mitigating condition fully applied, the Judge articulated \nthe specific factors that led him to find that Applicant did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances or in good faith (e.g., delaying the filing of federal and state tax returns until 2019 \nand entering into a payment arrangement with state tax authorities only after garnishment of his \nbank account). \nIn asserting that the mitigation analysis is flawed and that decision is arbitrary and \ncapricious, Applicant repeatedly argues for the Judge to weigh the evidence differently. \nApplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3. \nAdditionally, Applicant relies on hearing-level decisions in other cases to argue the Judge \nerred in his analysis of this case. As the Board has consistently stated, how particular fact \nscenarios were adjudicated in other cases is generally not a relevant consideration in the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s review of a case. None of the hearing-level decisions that Applicant cites are sufficient \nto show the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

This argument is unpersuasive, as we have long held that the presence \nof some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable security clearance decision. See ISCR \nCase No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). Rather, the judge must weigh the evidence as a \nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or vice versa. Id. In \nfinancial cases, an applicant having paid his debts does not obligate the judge to find favorably \nregarding the debts themselves or to enter a favorable formal finding. To the contrary, the facts \nand circumstances underlying the debts, including how they were incurred, became delinquent, \nand were addressed, are relevant factors for the judge to consider for what they may reveal about \nthe applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005). Here, the Judge made sustainable findings regarding Applicant\u2019s history of financial \nproblems and the timing of his efforts to resolve the SOR concerns, which, based upon the \ndocumentation available in the record, appear to have occurred only after the SOR was issued. \nApplicant also provides new evidence in the form of an updated credit report and \ndocumentation regarding the SOR allegation that the Judge concluded remained outstanding. The \nAppeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on \nappeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nWe turn finally to Applicant\u2019s argument regarding his involvement with a debt resolution \ncompany in 2020. The record reflects that Applicant began working with the company in \nNovember 2020 to address five of his debts, with $575 monthly payments scheduled through \nOctober 2022. SOR Response at 8-14. Although Applicant provided the payment schedule set \nforth when he entered the agreement, there is no evidence in the record regarding how many \npayments Applicant actually made pursuant to it, if any. Despite that the Government repeatedly \nidentified this evidentiary hole (see, e.g., FORM at 3), Applicant failed to provide documentation \nof his payments in his subsequent FORM response. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he failed to provide proof of his \npayments to the company, noting that he \u201clisted the payments in the original email,\u201d but that the \naccount is otherwise too old to be able to provide proof of the actual payments. Appeal Brief at 1. \n1 See Decision at 8 (\u201c[Applicant] took these actions in direct response to the Government\u2019s evidence in this FORM, \nand well after the initiation of the security clearance process. He did not explain how he obtained the funds to make \nthese payments and why he waited so long to resolve the debts. The timing of his action negatively impacts the degree \nto which the mitigating factors apply.\u201d). \n2 See, id. (\u201cHe has been gainfully employed with the same defense contractor since August 2012. He did not disclose \ninformation about his earnings, savings or checking accounts, or other financial assets; nor did he disclose information \nabout his routine household expenses to permit me to evaluate the reasonableness of his actions under the \ncircumstance. Applicant has a long history of financial problems as established by the record. He readily admitted he \nhas mismanaged his funds and has failed to live within his means at times.\u201d). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis argument fails for several reasons. First, Applicant\u2019s documentation \u2013 to include his \nreferenced payment schedule and email narrative \u2013 simply does not reflect compliance with \npayments, and the Judge\u2019s conclusion in that regard was well supported. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s claim that he was unable to provide proof of actual payments \nbecause the account is so old and the company has since filed bankruptcy, this position is curious \nbecause, as the Government noted in its FORM, Applicant appears to have access to the \ndocumentation relatively recently. For example, he claimed to still be working with the company \nas of at least February 2023 (see SOR Response at 7), only one year before the FORM was issued \nand he was alerted to the importance of the missing evidence. He then asserted his ability to provide \nsuch payment documentation to his security officer as recently as April 2023. Applicant\u2019s latest \nclaim of inability to access the records, despite seemingly having had such access recently, detracts \nfrom the credibility of his participation in the agreement or resolution efforts predating the SOR. \nConclusion \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of \ndemonstrating that the judge committed factual or legal error.

May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. \n29, 43 (1983)). For the following reasons, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision. \nFailure to Address All Guideline H Concerns \nWith the five Guideline H concerns admitted, the Judge reasonably found Applicant\u2019s \nconduct disqualifying under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).1 Then, citing generally Applicant\u2019s \u201clifelong \nabuse of drugs,\u201d but specifically addressing her marijuana and cocaine use and referencing her \n2021 Adderall sales, the Judge concluded that none of the mitigating conditions was fully \nestablished. Decision at 8. Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s failure to specifically address SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d resulted in a \u201cdeficient analysis\u201d that renders the decision arbitrary and capricious. \nAppeal Brief at 6. This argument is of mixed merit. \nWhile his characterization of Applicant\u2019s drug use history is arguably hyperbolic, it is clear \nthat the Judge considered all of Applicant\u2019s drug-related conduct in his Guideline H analysis. His \nfailure to specifically address Applicant\u2019s marijuana purchases or Adderall misuse does not, per \nse, constitute error because his analysis of Applicant\u2019s history of drug use, to include the subject \nallegations, is clear from the decision. See ISCR Case No. 98-0809 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 1999) \n(\u201cA Judge\u2019s decision must set forth findings and conclusions with sufficient specificity and clarity \nthat the parties and this Board can discern what the Judge is finding and concluding.\u201d). The \nhyperbole coupled with the Judge\u2019s cumulative analysis of Applicant\u2019s drug-related conduct are, \nhowever, problematic. \nThe Board has long cautioned judges against weighing evidence in isolation, lest such \nbreakdown violate the Whole-Person Concept and result in an unsustainable piecemeal analysis. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-11489 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2003). While the requirement to consider \nthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances remains firmly in place, the intersection \nof marijuana use and other illegal drug use represents a unique, limited, and nuanced situation \nwhere it may be inadequate to exclusively analyze the conduct together. \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse; 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nIn recognition of the changing landscape of marijuana law and in consideration of the \nDirector of National Intelligence\u2019s Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana2, the Board has \nnoted that significant factual and legal differences may exist between an applicant\u2019s state-\ncompliant marijuana use and use of other illegal drugs, holding that such differences are an \nimportant aspect of the case that a reasonable person would expect to be addressed. See ISCR Case \nNo. 22-02132 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023). In initial eligibility determinations, if the record \nreflects such differences, the judge must articulate a rational basis for why, after consideration of \nthose differences and the Clarifying Guidance, the conduct continues to cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAcknowledging that Applicant last used marijuana and cocaine in January 2023, there are \nsignificant differences in her drug-related conduct to be noted. For example, she abstained from \nusing marijuana from mid-2018 to mid-2021 in conjunction with her pregnancy, and marijuana \npossession was decriminalized in her residential state in July 2020 and adult recreational use was \nlegalized in July 2021.3 Unlike her recreational marijuana use and contrary to the Judge\u2019s summary \nfinding that the use was \u201cfrequent\u201d, Applicant used cocaine a total of three times between \napproximately 2012 and 2023. Regarding her Adderall misuse, Applicant sold her prescription \u201ca \nfew times\u201d in 2021 and misused Adderall when her own prescription ran out \u201ca few times\u201d at \nunknown dates, but no more recently than early 2022 when she stopped using the prescription \nentirely. See Tr. at 40, 42, 45; Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 50; GE 2 at 7. We note the foregoing, \nnot to minimize the seriousness of illegal drug use or misuse, but simply to identify the distinctions \nbetween Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and use of other substances that make a summary analysis \ninsufficient. \n2 In 2014, noting the recent decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the District of Columbia, the \nDirector of National Intelligence issued a memorandum reminding agency heads that such changes to state marijuana \nlaws do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines and asserting that an individual\u2019s disregard \nof federal marijuana law remains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. DIR. OF NAT\u2019L INT., \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (Oct. 2014). \nSubsequently in 2021, however, particularly in response to the increasing number of state and local governments \nlegalizing or decriminalizing marijuana use, the Director of National Intelligence issued clarifying guidance, which \ninstructs that \u201cprior recreational marijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative,\u201d and reiterates the requirement that agencies utilize the Whole-Person Concept \u201cto carefully weigh a \nnumber of variables in an individual\u2019s life to determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, \nif at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable adjudicative \ndetermination.\u201d DIR. OF NAT\u2019L INT., Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 2021) [hereinafter Clarifying Guidance] at 2. \n3 The Board takes official notice of the following: \n(1) Effective July 1, 2020, simple marijuana possession was decriminalized in Virginia. VA Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2\u00ad\n250.1 (2020), repealed by Cannabis Control Act, VA Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-600 to -628, -1100 to -1121, -1302, \n-1500 to -1503 (2021). \n(2) Effective July 1, 2021, adult recreational use of marijuana was legalized in Virginia.

The Judge\u2019s rendering of such broad and communal findings impairs his analysis of the \nGuideline H concern and Whole-Person Concept in light of the Clarifying Guidance, which should \nbe remedied on remand. \nGuideline H Mitigating Conditions \nThe Judge identified mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b), and 26(d) as potentially \napplicable, but ultimately concluded that none was fully established. Applicant challenges the \nJudge\u2019s failure to apply AG \u00b6 26(b), which affords mitigation when \u201cthe individual acknowledges \nhis or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome \nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence.\u201d The condition identifies several non\u00ad\nexclusive examples to support such mitigative efforts, which the Judge analyzed individually. \nNoting that Applicant \u201cfound new friends and is working in a drug-free environment,\u201d the \nJudge concluded that AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) \u2013 disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts \u2013 \nwas fully established. Decision at 8. Referring to one particular friend, the Judge went on to assess \nthat AG \u00b6 26(b)(2) \u2013 changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used \u2013 was not \nestablished because, although Applicant \u201chas promised to disassociate from\u201d the friend with whom \nshe last used cocaine, \u201cinsufficient time has passed to determine if she will keep that promise, \nespecially if she encounters another stressful situation.\u201d Id. \nApplicant first argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis under AG \u00b6 26(b) imposed an improper \ntiming requirement when he concluded that insufficient time has passed to determine if Applicant \nwill maintain her disassociation from her drug-using friend. This argument is unpersuasive. \nAssessing a pattern of abstinence requires reviewing an individual\u2019s conduct for consistency and \nrepetition over time. It was not error for the Judge to consider how much time had passed since \nApplicant disassociated from drug-using contacts in assessing her pattern of abstinence. \nTo that end, however, the Judge\u2019s analyses under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are \nconflicting and therefore unclear. Either Applicant has sufficiently disassociated from drug-using \nassociates and environments, or she has not. We are unable to discern which conclusion the Judge \nreached here, rendering his analysis of these conditions unsustainable. \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s failure to consider certain evidence that she contends \nsupports application of AG \u00b6 26(b), including two negative drug tests and the diagnosis received \nduring her April 2024 substance abuse evaluation.4 In his factual findings, the Judge identified that \n\u201cApplicant was evaluated by a certified alcohol and drug counselor on April 23, 2024, and was \ndiagnosed with mild cannabis use disorder in remission\u201d and that she \u201cunderwent hair follicle tests \non March 4 and August 29, 2024, and tested negative for cocaine . . . and marijuana.\u201d Decision at \n4 Although Applicant assigns the Judge\u2019s failure to consider her evaluation and diagnosis as error under AG \u00b6 26(d), \nit is more appropriately considered in the context of AG \u00b6 26(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4. The Judge did not address this evidence further, except to conclude that the evaluation failed to \nestablish AG \u00b6 26(d).5 While we agree with the Judge\u2019s assessment that the evaluation does not \nafford application of AG \u00b6 26(d), considering the emphasis placed on Applicant\u2019s ability to \ndemonstrate abstinence, her diagnosis in remission and multiple negative drug tests taken about \nsix months apart was significant evidence that should be discussed. See ISCR Case No. 05-03250 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007) (Although a judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of \nrecord evidence, he \u201ccannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a \nreasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\u201d). \nTurning to the third example supporting mitigation, AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) considers an applicant \n\u201cproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.\u201d The Judge found that the condition was not fully established because, although \nApplicant \u201cprovided a statement of intent to abstain from drug involvement and substance abuse,\u201d \nthat statement did not \u201cinclude the specific acknowledgement that future involvement is ground \nfor revocation of any security clearance.\u201d Decision at 8. Applicant challenges this finding and the \nresulting inapplicability of the mitigating condition. \nApplicant submitted two separate documents in response to the SOR, including her \nresponse to the SOR\u2019s allegations and a personal statement. In the former, she stated, \u201cI have \nprovided a signed Personal Statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility.\u201d SOR Response at 3 (emphasis added). In the latter, she \u201crecognize[d] the \nseverity of [her] past drug use and involvement\u201d and expressed regret for the same, stated her \nintention to abstain from future drug use, and detailed her positive changes she has made in her \nlife to support that abstinence. Applicant\u2019s personal statement did not, however, recite the specific \nlanguage used in mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), acknowledging that any future involvement \nor misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nWe have routinely upheld findings that AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) is not met by a statement of intent \nthat fails to include an acknowledgment that future drug involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00535 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nMar. 13, 2017). This is not such a case. Rather than reading the initial statement and personal \nstatement exclusive of each other, the entire SOR response should be considered together. Contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s finding, Applicant\u2019s initial statement did not suggest her willingness to provide the \nnecessary statement of intent, but asserts that she did provide it, with all necessary language. \nAlthough the latter personal statement does not include AG \u00b6 26(b)(3)\u2019s acknowledgment \nlanguage, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s initial statement that she intended to incorporate \u2013 and was \ncommitted to \u2013 the potential consequence to her national security eligibility. Indeed, the Judge \n5 AG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, but not limited to, \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. Notably, Applicant also argues that the Judge erred by failing to apply this mitigating condition, \n\u201cdespite ample evidence in the record supporting such a finding.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, \nit was not improper for the Judge to decline to apply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(d) because Applicant had not, in \nfact, completed a prescribed drug treatment program. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nopined that he was \u201csatisfied that she understands that any future drug involvement may result in \nrevocation of any security clearance that she receives.\u201d Decision at 8. \nDespite that conclusion, which appears to reflect that the Judge agreed that the entire SOR \nresponse included the requisite recitals, the Judge found the applicable mitigating condition only \npartially applicable. To the extent that the Judge did not find Applicant\u2019s SOR response sufficient \nto merit full application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), such finding is in error. \nGuideline E Analysis \nWe turn next to the Guideline E concern, which simply cross-alleged the exact conduct \nalleged already under Guideline H. The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s drug use was disqualifying \nunder AG \u00b6 16(e), which considers \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes . . . engaging in activities \nwhich, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Noting \nthat \u201cApplicant has disclosed her drug involvement to her current boyfriend and her employer,\u201d \nthe Judge found mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(e)6 was established but concluded that the Guideline \nE concern was not mitigated. Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for his conclusion and ruling against [Applicant\u2019s] eligibility under Guideline E,\u201d \nciting specifically a lack of \u201cany analysis of how he came to this conclusion.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12. \nWe agree. \nThe Judge\u2019s disqualification analysis consisted of a finding that AG \u00b6 16(e) was established \nby \u201cApplicant\u2019s admissions that she used marijuana, used cocaine, associated with drug users, and \nillegally sold Adderall.\u201d Decision at 9. He failed, however, to articulate why the information would \nbe of interest to foreign intelligence operatives or how such actors would use it to pressure or \ncoerce Applicant, rendering his Guideline E disqualification analysis unsustainable. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge, having found mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(e) \napplicable, erred in concluding that the Guideline E concern was unmitigated. There is a rational \nconnection between conduct that an applicant does not want discovered by her family, friends, or \nemployer, and a concern that she \u201ccould be pressured to disclose classified information should this \nconduct come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-02407 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2017). Here, however, Applicant\u2019s family, friends, and \nemployer are aware of the SOR concerns, which she voluntarily disclosed and openly discussed \nthroughout her security clearance investigation. Assuming, arguendo, that the Judge found AG \u00b6 \n16(e) applies based on a concern that Applicant\u2019s prior drug use was not widely known and could \ncreate a vulnerability, it is unclear why that concern is not fully mitigated by her openness about \nthe conduct. \n6 AG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nor duress. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s Guideline E decision is arbitrary and \ncapricious as the analysis fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made. \nConclusion \nWhen the Board finds that a judge\u2019s decision is unsustainable, we must determine if the \nappropriate remedy is remand or reversal. The latter is appropriate when the identified errors \ncannot be remedied through remand and the Board concludes from the record that a contrary \nformal finding or overall grant or denial of security clearance eligibility is the clear outcome. \nRemand is appropriate when the errors can be corrected and there is a significant chance of \nreaching a different result upon correction. See ISCR Case No. 22-01002 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n2024). In light of the record before us, we conclude that there is such a chance, and the best \nresolution of this case is to remand it to the Judge for the opportunity to address the errors identified \nherein and thereafter determine if Applicant has or has not sufficiently mitigated the Government\u2019s \nconcerns. Upon remand, the Judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The \nBoard retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision; however, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after \nremand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130 \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-02402 is REMANDED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSeparate Opinion of Board Member James B. Norman \nI respectfully dissent from my colleagues' remand of the Administrative Judge's decision in this \ncase. \nFailure to Address All Guideline H Concerns \nThe majority\u2019s remand of this case finds error in the Judge\u2019s analytical process because he \ndiscussed Applicant\u2019s drug involvement cumulatively, which they conclude failed to properly \nconsider the Security Executive Agent\u2019s Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana (Clarifying \nGuidance), as well as Appeal Board precedent. However, this is an overly broad reading of the \nClarifying Guidance and our prior cases, and impinges on the discretion afforded judges. After \nreviewing the record, I conclude that the Judge's analytical process was in accord with the \nClarifying Guidance and case law, that his material findings as to Applicant's conduct of security \nconcern are based upon a permissible interpretation of the record evidence, and, therefore, a \nremand is not necessary. \nThe Clarifying Guidance is not a stand-alone document. It is an elaboration on an October \n25, 2014, Security Executive Agent Memo titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use.\u201d (2014 Memo) That Memo unequivocally states that \"changes to state laws and \nthe laws of the District of Columbia pertaining to marijuana use do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines. An individual's disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, \nsale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security \ndeterminations.\" The 2014 Memo also explicitly states that \u201cunder federal law, use of marijuana \nremains unlawful,\u201d and \u201cwhile several states have decriminalized marijuana or allowed its use for \nmedical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana remains subject to the applicable \ndisqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at fn. 2 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 23, 2018). \nThe 2014 Memo confirms that DOHA\u2019s administrative judges retain significant latitude \nand discretion when evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance. In terms of \npossible mitigation of drug use, each case is fact-specific and, \"[a]s always, adjudicative authorities \nare expected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, marijuana using the \ncurrent adjudicative criteria.\" The 2014 Memo is deferential to the adjudicative process, stating \nthat the \"adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply \nwith law, rules, and regulations, including federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of \npersons proposed for, or occupying, national security positions.\" See ISCR Case No. 23-00521 at \n5-6 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2024). \nConsistent with the 2014 Memo, the Clarifying Guidance is unequivocal that \u201cunder policy \nset forth in SEAD 4's adjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances \ncan raise security concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations (Reference B, Guideline H). Drug involvement may raise similar \nconcerns about personal and criminal conduct (Reference B, Guidelines E, J).\u201d However, within \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthat construct, the Clarifying Guidance states that although disregard of federal law pertaining to \nmarijuana remains relevant, it is not determinative. The Guidance elaborates by focusing on the \nimportance of a whole person analysis and notes some of the mitigating factors reflected in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines. The Appeal Board has interpreted the Clarifying Guidance as a \nrecognition that the proliferation of state laws legalizing medical and recreational marijuana may \nframe pre-clearance marijuana use in a different light inasmuch as that use may have taken place \nwith an honest belief that it was legal despite federal law to the contrary. ISCR Case No. 23-00476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 1, 2024). \nInasmuch as the Clarifying Guidance was promulgated \u201cparticularly in response to the \nincrease in the number of state and local governments legalizing or decriminalizing uses of \nmarijuana,\u201d it cannot be read broadly to encompass all marijuana use. The focus is on \npresumptively-legal marijuana use. Even then, whatever leeway state-legality offers in terms of \nmitigation may be diminished when there is evidence that includes use of other drugs, the sale of \ndrugs, or drug use that occurs over an extended period of time. Therefore, although pre-clearance, \nstate-legal marijuana use, standing alone, may raise fewer security concerns than in the past, a \nproper drug analysis is contextual and it is not improper for a judge to consider marijuana use \nconcurrent with the assessment of other drug use or conduct. \nThe majority finds error because the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s marijuana and cocaine \nuse in tandem. However, neither the Clarifying Guidance nor DOHA case law mandate that a \nseparate assessment of marijuana use be conducted that is independent of the weighing of an \napplicant\u2019s other drug use. There is a presumption in favor of regularity and good faith on the part \nof DOHA judges as they engage in the process of deciding cases. ISCR Case No. 14-02025 at 2 \n(May 12, 2015) citing ISCR Case No. 99-0019 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 1999). Just as a judge is \npresumed to have considered all evidence, a judge is presumed to be knowledgeable about and \nfollow applicable law and regulations rather than personal predilections. See ISCR Case No. 09\u00ad\n06406 at 3 (Apr. 13, 2011); See, also ISCR Case No. 11-07666 at 3 (June 7, 2013) (presumption \nthat the Judge properly considered applicable mitigating conditions). \nThe majority places emphasis on ISCR Case No. 22-02132 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2023) for \nthe proposition that factual and legal differences may exist between an applicant\u2019s marijuana use \nand use of other illegal drugs, and that this is an important aspect of the case that a reasonable \nperson would expect to be specifically addressed. In that case the Board concluded that \u201cthe Judge \nconsidered all of Applicant\u2019s drug use together in a very succinct mitigation analysis that, besides \nthe standard Guideline H language, consisted of four sentences. In doing so, the Judge failed to \naddress significant factual and legal differences between Applicant\u2019s state-compliant marijuana \nuse and his other illegal drug use.\u201d ISCR Case 22-02132 at 3 (emphasis added). As such, because \n\u201cthe Judge failed to conduct an appropriate analysis of Applicant\u2019s state-compliant marijuana use \nunder the SecEA Clarifying Guidance,\u201d the case was remanded. Id. at 4 (emphasis added). Based \nupon that case, the majority concludes in the present case that the Judge failed to conduct an \nappropriate analysis of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use under the Clarifying Guidance because he did \nnot address factual and legal differences between Applicant\u2019s marijuana and cocaine use. \nI do not disagree with the proposition that marijuana use may involve some unique \ncontextual considerations that are not present when an applicant is using a drug such as cocaine. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNor do I disagree that when there are significant factual and legal differences between an \napplicant\u2019s marijuana and other drug use those differences should be addressed. Where the \nmajority and I diverge is whether, in this case, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use presented sufficient \nfactual or legal differences from her other drug use that required a more detailed discussion. \nIn ISCR Case No. 22-02132, the majority of the applicant\u2019s marijuana use was in a state in \nwhich the recreational use of marijuana was legal and the Board concluded that the judge failed to \naddress significant factual and legal differences between Applicant's state-compliant marijuana \nuse and his other illegal drug use. Id. at 4. However there is a significant factual difference between \nthe present case and the cited case because in the present case there is no evidence that any of \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was under color of law. When there is such evidence, it could present a \ndistinction requiring further explanation, depending upon the overall circumstances. Even if the \nJudge had, sua sponte, taken judicial notice of a state marijuana law, as the majority has done, and \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s 2021 marijuana use was compliant with her state\u2019s laws, that single \nevent does not mandate a separate or comparative analysis.7 \nUnlike ISCR Case No. 22-02132 in which the Judge engaged in a minimalist, \u201csuccinct\u201d \nmitigation analysis, the Judge in the present case conducted a more robust analysis of the \ncumulative drug involvement. The majority\u2019s assessment of the Judge\u2019s characterization of \nApplicant\u2019s drug use amounts to a subjective disagreement with the weighing of the evidence \nwhich, in turn, informs its conclusion that a more detailed analysis was required. Much as an \napplicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate error, the Board also must \nnot engage in such an assessment in the context of invoking the Clarifying Guidance. \nAlthough the Judge could have written more in his decision about these matters, the Board \ndoes not review a Judge's decision against a standard of perfection. ISCR Case No. 01-17539 at 3 \n(May 2, 2003). Considering the decision in its entirety, I conclude that the Judge adequately and \ncorrectly addressed Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. \nGuideline H Mitigating Conditions \nI disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Judge\u2019s analyses of AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and \n26(b)(2) conflict with each other. Applicant\u2019s argument that a finding for Applicant under AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(1) mandates the same finding under AG \u00b6 26(b)(2) would merge the two mitigating \nconditions into one. However, \u201c[p]rovisions of the Directive should not be construed or interpreted \nin a manner that renders them meaningless or superfluous.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3, 5 (App \nBd. Oct. 7, 2004). While some mitigating conditions have overlapping aspects, each is a separate \nprovision and will be interpreted in that manner. ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at fn. 2 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018). It is entirely feasible that Applicant may have disassociated herself from associations \nwith certain individuals but in the larger context of the evidence, there remain questions as to \nwhether this will continue. For example, in this instance an old high school acquaintance \nspontaneously re-entered Applicant\u2019s life and asked Applicant to sell her Adderall; a request to \n7 Although the Board can take judicial notice of a statute or regulation on appeal, just as a judge may take judicial \nnotice at a hearing, a judge is not required to sua sponte take judicial notice of a state marijuana statute absent an \nassertion or other evidence that an applicant\u2019s marijuana use was allegedly state-compliant. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich Applicant complied. Such conduct could reasonably weigh against application of AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(2) despite a favorable finding under AG \u00b6 26(b)(1). \nThe majority also finds that the Judge erred in addressing Applicant\u2019s negative drug tests \nand diagnosis only under AG \u00b6 26(d) and not AG \u00b6 26(b). However, given the presumptions \ndiscussed above, it is reasonably likely that this was considered throughout the Judge\u2019s assessment \nof the case even though it was not specifically mentioned vis a vis each possible mitigating \ncondition. \nAs to Applicant\u2019s statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, neither the \nstatement of intent nor the Judge's discussion of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) are models of clarity. When the \nAppeal Board examines individual words or sentences in a Judge's decision, we do not consider \nthem in isolation. ISCR Case No. 02-11489 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2003). Rather, we consider \nthem in light of the decision in its entirety. ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, \n2021). I agree with the majority that, read in concert, various statements reflect Applicant\u2019s intent \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future and an understanding of the repercussions of doing so. \nHowever, just as we read Applicant\u2019s statement in a comprehensive manner, we must read the \nJudge\u2019s analysis in concert with his broader discussion of the facts in this case. In the context of \nthe entire paragraph, it is clear that the Judge gave Applicant\u2019s statement some degree of mitigating \nvalue. However, the presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence does not compel a \nfavorable security clearance decision. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nRather, the judge must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence \noutweighs the unfavorable, or vice versa. Id. Even if Applicant\u2019s statement was sufficient to merit \nfull application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) and the Judge\u2019s application was erroneous, it is harmless error in \nthe context of the Judge\u2019s overall analysis of the facts. \nGuideline E Analysis \nI concur with the majority\u2019s analysis of this Guideline, however, given my opinion that the \nJudge\u2019s findings under Guideline H are sustainable, this error is harmless and does not mandate \nremand. \nConclusion \nIt is not necessary that the Board agree with the ultimate result or analysis to find that the \nJudge followed the correct process in reaching his conclusion. Here, he examined the relevant facts \nin a manner consistent with ISCR Case No. 22-02132, the Clarifying Guidance, and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines. The adverse decision is sustainable on this record. \nSigned: James B. Norman \nJames B. Norman \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n12 \n",

Pursuant to the Directive, the Judge was required to \u201cmake a new clearance \ndecision in the case after correcting the error(s) identified by the Appeal Board.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.35. Instead of correcting the identified errors through a new, independent decision on remand, \nthe Judge attempted to refute the majority opinion.

AG \u00b6 16(e) considers: \n1) conduct or 2) concealment of conduct, when either \u201ccreates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group,\u201d and then \nillustrates the concern through examples of conduct that could invoke its application. The Judge \nfound AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) \u2013 \u201cengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing\u201d \u2013 relevant here. (Emphasis added). \nIn his original Decision, the Judge simply restated the SOR allegations as his basis for \napplying AG \u00b6 16(e)(1). Noting that Applicant\u2019s drug use history was known to her family, friends, \nand employer, the Board questioned how the known conduct renders her vulnerable to interference \nby foreign intelligence entities or anyone else. On remand, the Judge opined that he found the \nBoard\u2019s statement \u201cbaffling,\u201d and concluded that his application of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n17(e) reflects that he was not \u201cconcerned about this information being in the hands foreign \nintelligence operatives.\u201d Remand Decision at 8. \nThe Judge\u2019s explanation for his mitigation analysis missed the Board\u2019s point. Before \nmoving to application of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(e), the Judge needed to articulate his \nrationale for applying disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e) \u2013 i.e., how Applicant\u2019s known and \nacknowledged drug use history could affect her personal, professional, or community standing and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopen the door for the disqualifying vulnerability to outside influence.

In light of those \nerrors, no useful purpose would be served by remanding the case to the same Administrative Judge. \nAccordingly, the Board remands the case with the recommendation that it be reassigned to another \njudge for further processing. \nWhen there is a remand to a different Administrative Judge, and credibility is an issue in \nthe case, a new hearing may be necessary. See DISCR Case No. 90-0279, 1993 WL 545025 at *5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 1993). Because Applicant\u2019s credibility may be important to the issues in this \ncase, the judge assigned on remand should ascertain if the parties consent to have a determination \nmade on the basis of the existing record. If both parties consent to such a determination, then the \njudge should render a new decision without holding a new hearing. If either party declines to \nconsent to having the case decided on the basis of the existing record, then the judge should hold \na new hearing and issue a decision that complies with all of the relevant provisions of the Directive. \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-02402 is REMANDED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

He subsequently engaged in inpatient treatment at a military medical center (MMC) \nfrom February to March 2018. To prevent another relapse, Applicant used over-the-counter (OTC) \nmedication to create a dissociative effect to facilitate sleep. Between March and July 2018, he \nmisused an OTC medication and, as a result, he was transported by a unit escort to MMC in April \n2018 because he was in a paranoid state and diagnosed with substance induced disorder (paranoid \nsecondary to cough syrup) and substance abuse disorder. Applicant was discharged from the \nmilitary in September 2018. \nBetween September 2019 and March 2020, Applicant participated in six inpatient alcohol \ntreatment programs, during which he was diagnosed with alcohol-related conditions including \nAUD, and was also diagnosed with bipolar II disorder (BPD). In March 2020, he was arrested for \ndriving under the influence and carrying a gun in public while under the influence. His blood \nalcohol content was measured at 0.32.1 Applicant served 10 days in jail and was placed on \nprobation for a year. \nIn December 2020, having experienced significant stress from months of sobriety, the \njailtime, seasonal distress from losses, and job stress, Applicant was found walking outside without \nproper clothing and having developed frostbite and hypothermia. He was hospitalized in a \ncatatonic state, which continued to a significant degree until about the 20th day of hospitalization. \nApplicant was again diagnosed with AUD and BPD with catatonia. \nBetween December 2020 and January 2024, Applicant experienced multiple relapses and \nparticipated in approximately 11 additional alcohol detoxification and treatment programs. On six \noccasions in January 2023, he misused OTC medications with the understanding that the \nmedications have dissociative properties that would aid his sleep. During his various periods of \ntreatment, Applicant has received other alcohol- and substance-related diagnoses, and both AUD, \nsevere, and BPD have been reconfirmed several times, as recently as June 2024. \nAs part of the national security investigation and adjudication process, Applicant \nparticipated in three psychological evaluations, beginning in February 2023 with Dr. C, a licensed \npsychologist, who ultimately diagnosed Applicant with AUD, severe, and MDD, recurrent with a \nmoderate degree of severity. ln December 2023 and January 2024, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. \nF, a licensed psychologist, at the request of his employer based on concerns about possible effects \nof Applicant\u2019s substance abuse on his employment and security clearance. Dr. F concluded that \nApplicant met the diagnostic criteria for BPD, in full remission and AUD, moderate, noting that \n1 Applicant was also previously charged with disorderly conduct for urinating in public after consuming alcohol in \n2009. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had \u201cnot entered a period of sustained remission where he has not abused alcohol for at \nleast one year\u201d and concluding that Applicant may be a higher security risk. Decision at 8 (quoting \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) E). Finally, in June 2024, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. Y, a licensed \npsychologist, who concluded that Applicant met the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety \ndisorder, ADHD, BPD, in full remission, and AUD, severe, in early remission, among others. \nApplicant\u2019s psychotherapist since December 2021 through the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs, Dr. D, noted that Applicant was discharged from a VA residential recovery \ncenter in January 2024 with a favorable prognosis and subsequently completed aftercare for \npsychiatric and primary care treatment, and that Applicant has continued to see Dr. D through \ntelehealth appointments. Dr. D noted Applicant\u2019s favorable prognosis and concluded that, as of \nJune 2024, Applicant met the diagnostic criteria for AUD, severe, in sustained remission (5 \nmonths), anxiety disorder, mood disorder, and BPD, by history. \nDuring the hearing on November 21, 2024, Applicant testified that he last consumed \nalcohol on December 11, 2023. He admitted that he has struggled to maintain his sobriety during \nthe months of November, December, and January due to certain anniversaries. On the day \nfollowing his hearing, Applicant participated in a phosphatidyl ethanol test and tested negative for \nalcohol. \nUnder Guidelines G and I,2 the SOR alleged security concerns arising from the Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol-related conduct and psychological conditions, all of which he admitted with further \nexplanation in his SOR Response. The Judge favorably noted Applicant\u2019s 11 months of sobriety, \nestablishment of a healthy social circle of support, sincerity in his desire to remain sober, and \nparticipation in weekly counseling sessions and favorable prognosis. The Judge also identified \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cdedication and service to his country, fellow soldiers, family, and community,\u201d that \nhe \u201ccredibly, sincerely, and candidly discussed his journey of problematic alcohol consumption, \ntreatment, and relapse, as well as his mental-health conditions,\u201d and that he received positive \npersonal and professional character references for integrity, work ethic, and professionalism. \nDecision at 19-20. Considering the complete record and circumstances presented therein, however, \nthe Judge opined that Applicant\u2019s \u201clengthy cycle of consumption, treatment, and relapse requires \na more established pattern of abstinence\u201d and concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant national security eligibility. Id. at 20. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s Counsel presents an appeal brief that is, in significant part, a treatise \nabout the origins, importance, and complexities of the national security eligibility process. His \nspecific assignments of error, however, include that the Judge failed to completely analyze \nsignificant record evidence and made factual findings that were unsupported by the record, and, as \na result, failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. Applicant \nalso submits new evidence in the form of updates about his continued sobriety and treatment, \nwhich the Board may not consider.

He was honorably discharged.\u201d Decision at 3. Applicant challenges this finding as inaccurate \nbecause Applicant \u201csubmitted for a [Resignation in Lieu of Separation] and was approved\u201d and \nthat the \u201caction was still an Honorable Discharge with a reenlistment code that would allow for \nreenlistment with waiver.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12. In reaching the challenged finding, the Judge cited \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 8, which reflects that Applicant requested Resignation in Lieu of \nElimination, with elimination based on substandard performance of duty. Applicant\u2019s resignation \nwas accepted on August 24, 2018, with notation that he would be discharged with an Honorable \ncharacterization of service. On August 30, 2018, Applicant acknowledged that his Resignation in \nLieu of Elimination was approved and, accordingly, he would be involuntarily discharged effective \nSeptember 28, 2018. Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s finding is supported by the record. \nChallenges to Judge\u2019s Analysis and Conclusions \nApplicant\u2019s remaining challenges on appeal amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence. For example, he challenges that the Judge\u2019s characterization of his \nmilitary service did not include that he \u201cdeployed . . . to Iraq with distinction and received a Bronze \nStar Medal for service.\u201d Appeal Brief at 13. Applicant also charges that several of the Judge\u2019s \ncharacterizations of the evidence were incomplete, including that Applicant\u2019s mentor struggled \nwith alcohol and substance abuse and helped Applicant get help for himself, and that Applicant\u2019s \nfirst treatment facility was the same facility his late friend and mentor attended. Applicant\u2019s \narguments in this regard are unpersuasive. \nA judge must consider all the record evidence, and there is a rebuttable presumption that \nhe or she has done so unless the judge specifically states otherwise. See DISCR OSD Case No. 90\u00ad\n1596, 1992 WL 388420 at *4 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 1992). A judge is not required, however, to \ndiscuss or even mention every piece of record evidence in reaching a decision. Id. Accordingly, \nerror is not demonstrated merely because Applicant can cite to portions of the record evidence that \nwere not specifically discussed by the Judge. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s Guideline I mitigation analysis \u201cfails to note \n[Applicant\u2019s] demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan,\u201d which he \ncontends shows that his conditions are under control and fully mitigate the security concerns. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the Judge acknowledged \u201cApplicant\u2019s compliance with \ncounseling and medication and the favorable prognosis\u201d but concluded that \u201cdoubts remain \nwhether Applicant\u2019s relapses and episodes of paranoia or questionable judgment will recur.\u201d \nDecision at 17. In support of his conclusion, the Judge cited that Applicant was not taking any \nmedication to treat his MDD or BPD as of the hearing and considered himself to be \u2018under \nmedicated\u2019 at the time, was awaiting a medication management appointment to address psychiatric \nmedications and a treatment regimen, and that, despite his continued treatment with Dr. D and \nfavorable prognosis, Applicant was also in treatment with Dr. D during his multiple relapses in \nlate 2022 through late 2023. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe presence of favorable evidence does not compel a judge to issue a favorable decision. \nRather, a judge must weigh the record evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable \nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. See ISCR Case No. 96-0371 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 3, 1997). The Judge\u2019s conclusion that the favorable evidence presented by Applicant was \nnot sufficient to outweigh or overcome the unfavorable evidence does not mean that he failed to \nconsider the former. To the contrary, the decision reflects that the Judge thoroughly identified and \nweighed the favorable evidence cited by Applicant on appeal regarding his continued treatment \nand prognosis but concluded that Applicant needed to \u201cdemonstrate a longer period of abstinence \nfrom alcohol and without recurring paranoid or bizarre behaviors and adopt a medication and \ntreatment regimen to fully address his MDD, BPD, and ADHD diagnoses.\u201d Decision at 17. The \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s evidence did not mitigate the security concern was reasonable \nbased on the record before him. \nConsidering the Judge\u2019s written decision in light of the entire record, Applicant\u2019s \narguments on appeal fail to demonstrate error in the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating \nconditions or Whole-Person Concept. The Judge acted properly by weighing the record evidence \nas a whole and his conclusion that Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline G and Guideline I \nsecurity concerns was reasonable based on that weighing. Applicant\u2019s ability to argue for a more \nfavorable weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 96\u00ad\n0376 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 1997) (citing Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 523 \n(1981)). \nHearing-Level Decisions \nCounsel relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline G and Guideline I cases, \nseemingly to suggest how the Judge in this case could have differently applied the Whole-Person \nConcept and mitigating factors. For multiple reasons, this reliance is misplaced. Each case must \nbe decided on its own merits. AG \u00b6 2(b). How particular fact scenarios were decided at the hearing \nlevel in other cases is generally not a relevant consideration in the Board\u2019s review of a case. The \ndecisions that Counsel cites have no direct relationship or unique link to Applicant\u2019s case to make \nthem relevant here. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. The Judge weighed the disqualifying and mitigating evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Dept. of Navy v.

On July \n22, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied \nApplicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2022, and that he carried five delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $4,000. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the tax failures but \nasserted that the delinquent returns were filed as of March 2024.

Noting that Applicant sufficiently established \nthat he had resolved or was working to resolve his delinquent consumer debt, the Judge found \nfavorably on those five allegations. He resolved the tax allegations adversely, however, \nacknowledging Applicant\u2019s claim that \u201che filed all required tax returns,\u201d but finding that Applicant \nfailed to corroborate his claims, despite being \u201cgiven time after his hearing to provide [Internal \nRevenue Service] tax transcripts or copies of his tax returns or other evidence to show that he had \nfiled all tax returns.\u201d Decision at 10. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that \u201csignificant errors in the Judge\u2019s findings, including a \nfactual error regarding state income tax obligations . . . , failure to consider evidence that [he] filed \nall federal tax returns in 2023, failure to consider stolen identity, misapplication of adjudicative \nguidelines, and incorrect assessment of intent . . . materially affected the outcome of the case.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1. \nApplicant first challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse finding regarding his state tax returns on the \nbasis that he resides in a state that \u201cdoes not impose a state income tax on individuals\u201d and therefore \nhad no filing obligation. Appeal Brief at 1. In reply, the Government acknowledges that, although \nApplicant previously and repeatedly admitted the allegation and his belief that he was required to \nfile state income tax returns, Applicant\u2019s argument raised for the first time on appeal has merit and \nthe SOR erroneously alleged the state-level filing failure. The Government goes on to argue that, \nbecause \u201cthe Judge properly found unmitigated Applicant\u2019s delinquent Federal tax returns,\u201d the \nstate tax return \u201cerror was harmless and does not warrant reversing the Judge\u2019s unfavorable \nDecision.\u201d Reply Brief at 3. We agree. \nRegarding the federal taxes, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to properly consider the \ncircumstances leading to his tax filing delinquencies, including that he was the victim of identity \ntheft in about 2018 and fraudulent tax returns were filed in his name, which he asserts complicated \nhis \u201cability to file legitimate returns.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. He also argues that the Judge erred by \nfailing to consider evidence showing that Applicant filed the returns, including copies of the filings \nthemselves. Neither argument is persuasive. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s first argument, the Judge \ndetailed Applicant\u2019s explanation of \u201cidentify theft\u201d for his filing failures throughout the Decision\u2019s \nfactual findings, but ultimately concluded that Applicant failed to sufficiently demonstrate that he \nhad resolved the issue with supporting documentation. \nTurning then to the evidentiary component of Applicant\u2019s argument and despite his \ncontention that he submitted copies of his filed federal tax returns or any other evidence \ndemonstrating that the returns have been filed, the record is devoid of any such documentation. \nRather, the record reflects that Applicant was given multiple opportunities to provide \ndocumentation corroborating his explanation for failing to timely file his federal tax returns and \ntheir subsequent filing. He responded to Government interrogatories on January 25, 2024, asserting \nthat he filed his 2018 to 2022 federal returns that same day. Government Exhibit 4 at 13.1 Despite \nbeing instructed to provide his IRS Tax Account Statements for those tax years, Applicant instead \nprovided IRS Wage and Income Statements. Id. at 13, 17-39. Unlike the requested Tax Account \nStatements, which offer a comprehensive overview of a taxpayer\u2019s tax activity for a specific tax \n1 Notably, in his subsequent SOR response, Applicant asserted that he filed the federal returns two months after his \ninterrogatory response, in March 2024. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nyear, Wage and Income Statements reflect only data reported to the IRS by third parties via \ninformation returns (i.e., Forms W-2, 1099, 1098, or 5498.). \nThe Government noted this evidentiary hole at hearing when it indicated that there was no \nevidence, including via the Wage and Income Statements, that Applicant\u2019s federal returns had been \nfiled. Tr. at 15, 33-34. At the end of the hearing, the Judge emphasized the importance of Applicant \nsubmitting additional documentation to support the purported federal filings and any resulting \nbalance owed, and he offered to leave the record open for two months to accommodate Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission. Applicant believed one month was sufficient and expected to produce evidence of the \nidentity theft police report and his IRS tax transcripts for the preceding five years. Id. at 52-55. \nDespite that month and the Judge\u2019s proactive offer to extend the submission window, if necessary, \nfor Applicant to produce the documentation, the Judge \u201cdid not receive any requests for additional \ntime or post-hearing documents from Applicant.\u201d Decision at 2. As a result, the Judge found that \nhe could not \u201ccredit [Applicant] with filing those five years of tax returns without receipt of readily \navailable corroboration to prove those tax returns were actually filed,\u201d and concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cfailure to prove that he took timely, prudent, responsible, and good-faith actions \nregarding his taxes raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d Decision at 8, 11. \nOnce the Government met its burden of demonstrating a prima facie case regarding \nApplicant\u2019s tax filing failures, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence to rebut, \nextenuate, or mitigate the evidence against him. Despite multiple opportunities to do so before and \nafter the hearing, Applicant produced no such documentary evidence. Accordingly, it was not \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to decline to accept Applicant\u2019s unsupported \nclaims that he had resolved his federal tax filings. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Rather, the Judge examined and weighed the disqualifying and mitigating \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-02412 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

On \nFebruary 27, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Along with her answer to the SOR, Applicant requested a decision based \non the written record, without a hearing. She was provided with the Government\u2019s File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) and was given the opportunity to submit a response. After no response was \nreceived, the case was forwarded to DOHA\u2019s Hearing Office for decision. On November 6, 2024, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Candace Garcia denied Applicant \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that on May 10, 2024, she responded to the Government\u2019s \nFORM and included, among other things, a request to convert the case to a hearing. Appeal Brief \nat 1. In support of this, her appeal brief contains a copy of her response.

However, the \nGovernment concurs that Applicant made a timely request for a change of forum and does not \nobject to a remand of the case.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 19, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nApril 16, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Jennifer I. \nGoldstein denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged ten concerns. The first eight (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h) alleged the following \nchronology of mental health events: since 2015, Applicant has been treated at a VA clinic\u2014with \nvarying regularity\u2014for diagnosed Depressive Disorder; in August 2017, Applicant was \ninvoluntarily hospitalized for a suicide attempt; on two other occasions in 2016 or 2017, Applicant \nattempted to commit suicide by overdosing on medications; in November 2017, early 2019, and \nagain in late 2019, Applicant discontinued his prescribed psychotropic medications without the \nconsent of his prescribing doctor; in late 2019, Applicant attempted suicide; and in early 2020, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant again discontinued taking his prescribed medication without the consent of his \nprescribing doctor. In addition to those alleged concerns, SOR \u00b6 1.i alleged that, during Applicant\u2019s \ntreatment by a private provider from 2017 to 2021, he was diagnosed with Depressive Disorder, \nthat the treatment provider noted recurring suicidal ideation, and that the provider recommended \ncontinued therapy upon discharge. Finally, SOR \u00b6 1.j reflected the evaluation and conclusions of \nthe DoD-contracted psychologist to whom Applicant was referred during the security clearance \nadjudication process. That psychologist diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar II Disorder, in \nremission, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, and she rendered a guarded prognosis \u201cunless [he] \nreturned to regular treatment for Bipolar II Disorder, to include pharmacotherapy and counseling.\u201d \nThe Judge found favorably for Applicant on the allegation relating to the DoD-ordered \nevaluation, but she found adversely on the other nine. The Government did not cross-appeal the \nJudge\u2019s favorable finding on SOR \u00b6 1.j, and the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions regarding \nthat allegation will not be discussed below. \nBackground and Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant is in his late thirties and employed by a defense contractor. He has held security \nclearance eligibility for 17 years. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2008 until \n2015 and has served in the National Guard since discharge from active duty. In 2011, Applicant \ndeployed to Afghanistan. During his deployment, Applicant was in a truck accident and suffered \na head injury. Applicant reported that he was diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), \nalthough his medical records on this issue are conflicting. While deployed, Applicant lost friends \nwho were killed in the line of duty. \nSince Applicant\u2019s discharge from active duty in 2015, he has attempted suicide on four \noccasions and has been treated for depressive disorder by both government and private providers. \nFollowing his 2015 discharge, Applicant initially sought treatment with the mental health clinic \non the military base, and his medical records indicate diagnoses of insomnia, depressive episodes, \nand migraine. In 2017, Applicant twice attempted suicide by overdosing on medications. The \nfirst attempt was in January 2017, on the anniversary of a fellow soldier\u2019s death. Applicant took \n18 pills but survived the attempt. He did not tell anyone outside of his family of his attempt at the \ntime. In June 2017, Applicant\u2019s primary care provider at the VA clinic prescribed Zoloft, an \nantidepressant. Within the next two months, Applicant again attempted suicide by overdose of \nsleeping medications, in the wake of another seizure and worsening migraines. \nIn July 2017, Applicant began mental health treatment with a licensed clinical social \nworker (EJ) associated with a private practice. EJ\u2019s treatment notes reflect that she saw Applicant \nfor about 30 sessions over five years, with the last session occurring in February 2021, and that \nApplicant reported recurring suicidal ideation, noncompliance with his prescription of Zoloft, and \nrepeated incidents of fluctuating moods. EJ diagnosed depressive disorder. \nIn August 2017, Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized for three days following a \nsuicide attempt. Applicant reported that he had been taking a prescribed medication that \nexacerbated his sleep issues and that, sleep-deprived, he saw a picture on social media of a friend \nwho had been killed in action. Although his recollection of events is imperfect, Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nacknowledged that he retrieved his firearm with the intent to shoot himself. His wife and sister \nintervened, and police transported him to a local hospital, where he was admitted, diagnosed with \nPTSD, and discharged with prescriptions of Zoloft and a sleeping medication. \nWithin a few months, in November 2017, Applicant stopped taking his prescribed \nantidepressant. In early 2019, he again stopped taking the prescribed medication. On those \noccasions, he informed his doctor he was not compliant with the prescribed medication, and his \ndoctor encouraged him to continue taking it as prescribed. Applicant also reported that he \nsometimes would stop taking his medication on drill weekends because he was operating heavy \nmachinery. \nIn September 2019, Applicant saw the psychiatrist who managed his medications. Her \nnotes reflected, \u201cPt. relates he self-discontinued all psychotropic medications about x3/4 months \nago. Pt. elaborates he stopped taking the medications because he felt like he was doing better and \ndidn\u2019t need them.\u201d Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 144. The psychiatrist again diagnosed depressive \ndisorder, unspecified, prescribed Zoloft, and noted in the diagnostic impressions that \u201cPt. appears \nto be an unreliable historian.\u201d Id. at 148. The psychiatrist also \u201cstrongly discouraged [Applicant] \nfrom self-discontinuation and self-adjustment of any prescription medication.\u201d Id. at 148. \nA few months later, in November or December 2019, Applicant chose to go off his \nprescribed medication for a few days, resulting in an attempted suicide. On this occasion, he ran a \nhose to his vehicle\u2019s exhaust system so that it dispersed carbon monoxide into the cabin of the \nvehicle. Applicant\u2019s wife discovered him in the driveway, and his suicide attempt was not \nsuccessful. \nIn March or April 2020, Applicant stopped taking prescription Zoloft for about a month, \nagain without the consent of his prescribing doctor. He testified that this was a result of the supply-\nchain disruption at the VA that occurred during COVID19. In February 2021, Applicant was again \nprescribed Zoloft. It was about this time that he apparently stopped treatment with EJ, his licensed \nclinical social worker, and transitioned to the VA for his mental health treatment. \nSince his discharge from active duty, Applicant has relied upon the VA for medical \ntreatment. Since 2021, Applicant has received mental health treatment at the VA as well, but he \nreported that it would often be six months from the time he requested an appointment to the date \nof the session, and frequently it would be with a new doctor. The week prior to the hearing, he \nvisited his primary care doctor who ordered a consult on mental health. Applicant is not currently \nprescribed any psychotropic medications. He reported that he has not had any thoughts of self-\nharm in the past five years, that he has developed mechanisms to cope with stress, and that he is \nclose to his family and extended family. \nIn May 2023, Applicant was evaluated for suicide risk. Medical records reflect that he \u201chas \ncurrent thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior\u201d and that he explained, \u201c[t]hey come and \ngo, its not an every day thing, its mainly when I think too much, or remember certain things that \ntrigger memory, things that happened in the past.\u201d Id. at 344. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted evidence of military awards, performance evaluations commending \nhis technical expertise, and community service that includes running a suicide awareness program \nfor the National Guard. \nIn her analysis, the Judge found that the Government established disqualifying conditions \nas follows: AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(c) were established by Applicant\u2019s four attempted suicides in 2017 \nand 2019, the suicidal ideations reflected in his medical records from EJ, and his involuntary \nhospitalization in 2017; AG \u00b6 28(b) was established by Applicant\u2019s diagnosed anxiety and \ndepressive disorders, as manifested in his suicide attempts and ideation; and AG \u00b6 28(d) was \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s failure to consistently follow his prescribed medication treatment plan.1 \nAfter identifying the mitigating conditions that were potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 29, \nthe Judge concluded: \nNone of the mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are \nsufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s diagnoses of depression and anxiety with \nconcomitant suicide attempts and suicidal ideations. His psychological conditions \nappear tied to his head injuries (potential TBI), epilepsy, and cognitive problems. \nWhile he is receiving cognitive therapy from a speech therapist, he did not present \nenough information to establish that his psychological problems or judgment issues \nare under control. Applicant has the burden of establishing evidence of mitigation \nand did not produce enough documentation to establish there is a low probability \nof recurrence. His depression and anxiety may potentially be controllable with \ntreatment, but he has failed to show he has followed an established treatment plan. \nHe did not offer a favorable prognosis into the record. Instead, his history of \ntreatment from 2015 to present shows inconsistent compliance with prescribed \nmedications. Without more evidence of a favorable prognosis or other supporting \nmitigation, I cannot find there is no longer a problem. Considering his long history \nof suicidal ideation and attempts, not enough time has passed to support full \nmitigation at this time. \nDecision at 11. \nTurning to the Whole-Person Concept, the Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence, his reputation for technical expertise, his community service, and his support \nfor his fellow soldiers. She concluded: \u201c[Applicant] has dedicated his life to serving the United \nStates and has experienced a number of life-changing events because of his willingness to serve. \nUnfortunately, those events have impacted his mental health and at this time, there is not enough \nevidence to support mitigation.\u201d Id. at 12. \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 28: (a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not \ncovered under any other guideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors; (b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has \na condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness; (c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient \nhospitalization; (d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric \ncondition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to \ntake prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nScope of Review \nOn appeal, the Board does not review a case de novo. Rather, the Board addresses the \nmaterial issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. There is \nno presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity \nand identify how the judge committed factual or legal error. \nWhen a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary \nor capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nDiscussion \nThrough counsel, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in her application of the \nmitigating conditions. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nApplicant failed to follow a treatment plan and that he did not present evidence of a favorable \nprognosis, arguing that \u201cthis conclusion is contradicted by substantial record evidence, including \nthe Applicant\u2019s testimony and treatment history.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. For the following reasons, we \naffirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nIn arguing that Applicant has an established treatment plan, Applicant\u2019s counsel asserts \nthat Applicant \u201chas been consistently engaged in psychological treatment with [EJ] from 2015 \nthrough 2021\u201d and that \u201che has been under the care of Dr. [M] at the VA from 2015 to the present.\u201d \nId. Counsel misinterprets the record evidence. For mental health counseling, the record evidence \nestablishes that Applicant saw EJ, a licensed clinical social worker in private practice, from 2017 \nthrough February 2021. Although he at times referenced transitioning his mental health care to the \nVA after leaving EJ\u2019s practice, Applicant confirmed at hearing that he had only one mental health \nappointment at the VA between February 2021 and the date of hearing in March 2025; that \nappointment was purportedly in April 2024, but Applicant could not recall the name of the provider \nwhom he saw. Transcript (Tr.) at 108\u2013109. Applicant did receive other health care services at the \nVA clinic, including routine physical health care, evaluations for TBI, and, most recently, speech \ntherapy. In his appeal brief, Applicant\u2019s counsel refers several times to Applicant\u2019s care under Dr. \nM at the VA from 2015 until the present. Applicant himself testified, however, that Dr. M was a \nmember of the speech pathology team whom he saw in 2023 and 2024 and not a mental health \nprofessional. Id. at 106\u2013107. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201chas failed to show he has \nfollowed an established treatment plan\u201d is supported by the record, and Applicant\u2019s argument to \nthe contrary is without merit. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel also argues that, contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding, he did offer a \nfavorable prognosis into the record. In support of this argument, Counsel cites to Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony during the hearing that he is \u201c1000 times in a better place than [he] was back then,\u201d that \nhis mood, emotions, and energy have been \u201cstable and predictable for the past five years,\u201d and that \nhis life has undergone a \u201c180-degree turnaround.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6\u20137, citing Tr. at 49, 54\u201355. We \nare not persuaded by Counsel\u2019s argument that this \u201cfavorable self-reported prognosis\u201d warrants \napplication of AG \u00b6 29(b) as \u201ca favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional.\u201d Id. at 9. The remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief amounts to a disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. None of Counsel\u2019s arguments, however, are sufficient to \nestablish the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On \nNovember 26, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, \n1992, as amended) (Directive).

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged two incidents of child abuse: 1) that Applicant was \ninvestigated in about March 2016 for assault and battery of a child and child neglect; and 2) that \nshe was arrested in about August 2021 and charged with Cruelty toward Child \u2013 Abuse Child \nwithout Great Bodily Harm, that she pled guilty, and that her adjudication of guilt was withheld \npending completion of two years of probation.

In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she denied all SOR allegations. The Judge \nfound adversely on the Guideline J allegations and favorably on the Guideline E allegation. The \nfavorable finding is not in issue on appeal and those facts and analysis will not be further addressed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is in her early thirties. A high school graduate, she served in the U.S. military \nfrom 2013 to 2022 when she was received a general discharge under honorable conditions for \nmisconduct. Applicant has a 10-year-old son (S), who lives with his father. \nIn early 2016, Applicant was suffering from postpartum depression. While at the pediatric \nclinic with S, who was then an infant, he started crying and Applicant slapped him, leaving a handprint \nand two scratch marks. Base police cited her for assault and battery on a child under the age of 16. \nApplicant did not face any disciplinary action from her command, but she went to family therapy \nfor about nine months. \nIn about August 2021, a school nurse reported Applicant to Child Protective Services \n(CPS) because of bruises on S\u2019s thighs and hips that S attributed to his mother spanking him with \nthe metal part of a belt. S was evaluated by the county\u2019s Child Protection Team (CPT). The county \nsheriff\u2019s report states: \n[S] disclosed to CPT that his mother spanked him with a belt. [S] also disclosed \nthat his mother put her hand on his neck and he could not breathe until she let go. [S] \ndisclosed that sometimes his mother bangs his head on the wall. [S] disclosed that \nhis mother locks him outside at night. [S] was observed to have multiple, deep \ncontusions and areas of patterned ecchymosis with swelling and tenderness of his \nbuttocks and thighs. Some of the contused areas appeared older, in different healing \nstages suggestive of at least two different incidents of trauma. CPT impression was \n\u201cExtensive patterned bruises of bilateral thighs and buttocks consistent with \negregious physical abuse of a six-year-old male child. [S] was subjected to \nsignificant, prolonged, blunt force trauma by a belt, possibly with holes or studs or \nsimilar object.\u201d \nDecision at 4 (quoting Government Exhibit 7). During the investigation, Applicant told a Child \nProtection investigator and school officer that she spanked her son with a ruler, which could have \nresulted in the bruising on one thigh and that she had noticed the bruises on his buttocks but did \nnot know where they came from and suspected it was from falling while bicycling. \nAt hearing, Applicant admitted that she was the source of some of the bruises on S\u2019s \nbuttocks, which resulted from her spanking S, but she denied hitting him with a belt. She did not \naccept responsibility for the bruises of varied ages on S and argued that the report should not be \naccepted as true because the CPS representative was not qualified to provide a medical opinion. \nShe also denied that she told a CPS representative that she hit S five or six strikes with a ruler. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with cruelty toward child \u2013 abuse child without great \nbodily harm.

During probation, Applicant attended anger management class once \na week for 10 weeks, an anger and violence prevention program once a week for 26 weeks, and \nfamily and group therapy once a week for ten weeks. During Applicant\u2019s probation period, CPS \nviewed her as a threat to S and refused contact. In July of 2023, Applicant\u2019s successfully completed \nprobation, and the charge was dismissed without conviction. \nIn character evidence, Applicant\u2019s mother described her as a loving mother who did \nnot use excessive physical punishment to discipline her son and discussed Applicant\u2019s \ngenerosity, athletic success in high school, and dedication to the U.S. military and her son. \nMilitary supervisors praised Applicant\u2019s professionalism, honesty, and attention to detail and \ndescribed her as an asset to her service. \nAnalysis \nCiting to Applicant\u2019s admission to slapping S as an infant in 2016 and her plea of guilty to \nthe child abuse charge in 2021, the Judge found that she committed both criminal offenses alleged \nin the SOR and that the evidence established security concerns under AG \u00b6 31(b).1 Turning to \nmitigation, the Judge highlighted Applicant\u2019s \u201cimportant mitigating information,\u201d to include her \nparticipation in anger management classes, an anger and violence prevention program, and family \nand group therapy, as well as her successful completion of probation. Decision at 10. The Judge \nultimately concluded, however, that Applicant failed to mitigate the concerns raised by her \ncriminal conduct: \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant was not \ntruthful at her hearing. She minimized the aggravated nature of her beating of S in \n2021. She falsely denied that she struck S with a ruler or belt. She said she only \nused her hand to spank him. She falsely denied that she locked him outside where \nhe was bitten by insects. \u201cWhen an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept \nresponsibility for his [or her] own actions, such a failure is evidence that detracts \nfrom a finding of reform and rehabilitation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to truthfully and \ncandidly accept responsibility for her conduct at her hearing shows a lack of \nrehabilitation. \nId. (quoting ISCR Case No. 20-01699 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2022). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant raises issues of bias and double jeopardy. Regarding the first, \nApplicant alleges that the Judge\u2019s decision is biased, one-sided, and \u201cshows no summary of any \nevidence submitted from . . . myself.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. An appealing party has a heavy burden \nof demonstrating conduct by a judge that deprived the hearing or decision of fairness and \nimpartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0282, 1995 WL 272062 at *3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1995) \n(citations omitted). Here, Applicant fails to carry her burden. The Judge\u2019s decision explicitly \nconsiders all character evidence that Applicant submitted, noting that it was \u201cimportant mitigating \n1 AG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) \nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation.\u201d Moreover, his decision cites repeatedly to Applicant\u2019s testimony as she conveyed \nher explanation of the alleged events. Finally, we note that the Judge found favorably for Applicant \non the Guideline E falsification allegation. In sum, we find nothing in the record to support \nApplicant\u2019s contention that the Judge was biased or that would persuade a reasonable person that \nthe Judge lacked impartiality. \nApplicant also alleges bias on the part of Department Counsel, based on remarks made \nduring closing arguments. Appeal Brief at 1. Although the Board has no supervisory authority over \nDepartment Counsel, the Board can review claims that the conduct of Department Counsel \nviolated or prejudiced an applicant\u2019s rights under Executive Order 10865 or the Directive. ISCR \nCase No. 02-04344 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2003). Upon review of Applicant\u2019s brief and the \ntranscript, we conclude that Applicant has established no prima facie case of any such violation. \nWe turn next to the gravamen of Applicant\u2019s appeal\u2014that \u201cthe hearing proceeding had me \nback on trial for a case closed\u201d and that \u201cDoD has no authority to put personnel back on trial for \ncases closed.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1, 2. We note first that AG \u00b6 31(b) expressly considers that a security \nconcern may be established regardless of whether an applicant was formally charged, prosecuted, \nor convicted. The fact that criminal charges were not pursued for the 2016 incident and that \nApplicant has no conviction for the 2021 incident in no way forecloses DoD from considering the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding that conduct in determining whether Applicant should be \ngranted a security clearance. \nRegarding the 2016 incident, it is well established that a judge can make findings of \ncriminal conduct even if the applicant has not been formally charged with a criminal offense by \nthe relevant criminal authorities. E.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018) \n(\u201cEven if criminal charges are reduced, dropped, or result in an acquittal, the Judge may still \nconsider the underlying conduct in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.\u201d). Here, \nApplicant admitted to the conduct alleged, which alone provides substantial evidence for the \nJudge\u2019s findings. \nRegarding the 2021 incident, the disposition of the criminal charge under state law is not \nmaterial to the Judge\u2019s decision in this case. For purposes of adjudicating Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance case, it is irrelevant that Applicant was awarded deferred adjudication and ultimately \nwas spared a conviction. The record evidence clearly supports the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \nentered a guilty plea in state court to the charge of child abuse, which alone was sufficient for the \nJudge to conclude that Applicant engaged in the criminal conduct to which she pleaded guilty. To \nthe extent that Applicant is challenging the factual sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings, the record \ndemonstrates that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial \nrecord evidence. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility \nfor her conduct demonstrates a lack of rehabilitation is well-rooted in the Appeal Board precedent \nto which he cites. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish any bias or that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Noting that Applicant had made no payments on the other two \nconsumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c) since quitting her job in 2022, the Judge resolved those \nallegations adversely. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the adverse findings for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c on the basis \nthat the accounts were turned over to the debt resolution attorney who is addressing SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nShe testified to the same at hearing and explained that the attorney had reached a settlement on \nSOR \u00b6 1.b for which Applicant was making monthly payments. She further testified, however, that \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was \u201cthe only one that had agreed for a settlement\u201d and the attorney was not actively \naddressing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c as of the hearing. Tr. at 31-32. This limited payment progress is \nfurther reflected in the documentary evidence, and the Judge\u2019s conclusion that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c \nremain unpaid is sustainable. \nTurning to the federal tax debt, the Judge found that Applicant had reduced the balance to \nabout $4,200. Because the debt resulted from Applicant claiming seven tax exemptions when she \nwas entitled to no more than three, the Judge \u201c[could not] ignore Applicant\u2019s fraudulent tax filings \ngoing back over ten years ago, covering a period of seven years\u201d and resolved the federal tax debt \nadversely. Decision at 5. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that her federal tax balance was about $4,200, \narguing instead that it is reduced to $2,300. The Judge\u2019s finding was based on Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 2024 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) online account statement, which reflects a balance \nof about $4,200 owed for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2018. Applicant Exhibit 1 at 10-11.1 Applicant \npoints to no evidence in the record to support her claimed $2,300 federal balance. Our review of \nthe record, however, reveals that Applicant\u2019s post-hearing evidence \u2013 a screenshot seemingly from \nher IRS account \u2013 reflected a balance of about $3,600 as of about October 2024. Post-Hearing \nExhibit 1 at 9-10. The evidence does not explain this additional $600 reduction. Even assuming \nmost favorably that it resulted from Applicant\u2019s direct payment, the Judge\u2019s erroneous finding was \nharmless. See ISCR Case No. 00-0250 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2001). The Judge\u2019s adverse \nconclusion was based in significant part on the reason underlying Applicant\u2019s tax balance \u2013 i.e., \nher years of over-claiming exemptions \u2013 and we do not believe an additional $600 balance \nreduction would likely have resulted in a different outcome. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. In the instant case, the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the \ndisqualifying and mitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. \nThe record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe \n1 It bears noting that the IRS statement specifically does not reference tax year 2013, for which Applicant previously \nowed about $3,200 but believed the IRS would \u201cwrite off\u201d due to age. See Government Exhibit 4 at 1; Tr. at 22. \nAccordingly, the evidence does not support that Applicant actually resolved the 2013 balance but, rather, that she did \nnot pay it and it simply aged off her account statement. The favorable credit afforded by the Judge to Applicant\u2019s tax \nbalance reduction appears undue; however, any such error inured to Applicant\u2019s benefit and is therefore harmless. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

She also found that, under the Whole-Person \nConcept, Applicant should be granted eligibility. \nOn appeal, the Government contends that the Judge erred in her mitigation analysis under \nGuideline E and in her Whole-Person analysis. The Government asserts the analysis of both were \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis. \nApplicant, in his late 30s, is an employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked \nsince August 2023. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He is married and has \none minor child and an adult stepdaughter. He completed high school. He has no military \nexperience or further educational training. \nFrom July 2017 to May 2020, Applicant was employed as a driver with Company A. He \nasked for a raise and was denied. He decided to use the company fuel card to purchase gas for his \npersonal vehicle over a span of a couple months during the last year of his employment with \nCompany A. Company A discovered this was happening and terminated him on May 28, 2020. \nOn the day he was terminated, Company A had Applicant sign a document acknowledging \nhe misappropriated the use of his company fuel card in the sum of $1,620. Applicant agreed to \nrepay the $1,620 plus an administrative fee of $380 for a total amount of $2,000. Company A \nwithheld his paychecks for the last two weeks that he worked, and he also forfeited any \ncompensation for unused vacation time. Applicant paid the remaining balance through an agreed-\nupon payment schedule until the debt was paid in full on September 25, 2020. \nApplicant admits that, when he completed the June 2023 SCA, he intentionally failed to \ndisclose his termination by Company A because he thought it would make him look bad and he \ndid not want it to have a negative impact on his new job. On September 13, 2023, he was \ninterviewed by an authorized investigator conducting his security clearance background \ninvestigation. During the interview, the investigator confronted him about his termination. \nApplicant admitted he intentionally omitted the information. He then told the investigator about \nusing the company gas card to pay for gas for his personal car. He mentioned that he repaid \nCompany A in full for the amount of gas that he purchased for his personal use. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he learned from this experience. He has \nchanged and intends to be completely honest about everything moving forward. He also presented \ntwo reference letters from women that know him personally and professionally. Both find \nApplicant to be honest. One noted that Applicant has learned from his experience and has become \na more responsible and trustworthy individual. He shares his experiences about his personal \ngrowth and professional challenges with others. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge found that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a)1 applied because Applicant failed \nto disclose his termination on his June 2023 SCA and that AG \u00b6 16(e)2 applied both because \nApplicant concealed his termination and because he used the company fuel card to fuel his personal \nvehicle.

In deciding \nwhether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, we will review the decision \nto determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline E was unsupported by the evidence. In particular, the Government asserts that the \nJudge failed to consider \u201cmultiple incidents of falsifying information to the Government and the \nfact that both the underlying misconduct and the falsifications themselves are demonstrative of his \nlack of candor and honesty.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6-7. \nFirst, the Government challenges the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating condition in AG \n\u00b6 17(c) and correctly notes that this mitigating condition has two parts. The Government argues \nthat the decision does not reasonably explain why the conduct in question occurred under unique \ncircumstances or why it was minor or infrequent, and as a result did not satisfy the first part of the \nmitigating condition. However, the Judge\u2019s analysis cites six reasons that cumulatively support \nher finding that the underlying conduct and subsequent falsifications are \u201cunlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment\u201d thereby \n1 Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a). \n2 Personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. AG \u00b6 16(e). \n3 The offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c). \n4 The individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive \nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d). \n5 The individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(e). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincorporating both requirements of AG \u00b6 17(c). Decision at 6. While the Judge only explicitly \nnoted the \u201cunlikely to recur\u201d language, it is clear from her analysis that she found the circumstances \nto be old, infrequent, and unique. \nNext, the Government asserts that the Judge conducted an improper piecemeal analysis \nthat \u201cfocused on the incidents in isolation, rather than the concerning pattern they establish.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 9-10. To support this argument, the Government argues that the Judge failed to \nconsider \u201c(1) that Applicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP and continued to deceive the \nGovernment during his enhanced subject interview when he failed to proactively correct the \ninformation he had previously provided and (2) that, taken together, both the underlying \nmisconduct and the deliberate falsification are incidents that call into question Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Id. at 8-9. However, the decision explicitly contradicts the first point. The Judge \nnoted in her discussion of AG \u00b6 17(c) that \u201cthe investigator confronted him about his termination\u201d \nbefore he disclosed the basis for the termination. Decision at 6. Further, the Judge\u2019s analyses under \nboth AG \u00b6 16 and AG \u00b6 17 discuss Applicant\u2019s underlying misconduct and his deliberate \nfalsification together but finds after considering the totality of the circumstances that similar \nconduct is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nThe Government also asserts that the Judge\u2019s credibility determination was unreasonable \nwhen viewed in the entirety of the record. However, the underlying facts are not in controversy. \nThe only credibility finding in controversy is the weight that the Judge gave Applicant\u2019s \nexpressions of remorse and her conclusion that Applicant learned his lesson from this experience. \nThe Judge had the opportunity to assess Applicant\u2019s demeanor when he testified at the hearing and \nthe opportunity to consider whether Applicant\u2019s explanations were credible in light of the record \nevidence as a whole. See ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2004). We have held \nthat a judge cannot rely on a credibility determination as a substitute for record evidence and that \na judge\u2019s assessment of the evidence should not suggest that the judge is using her authority to \nrender an improper credibility determination. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-07794 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 4, 2011). Here, the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that \u2014 in addition to her reliance on credibility \n\u2014 she also considered objective evidence in applying the mitigating conditions in question. For \nexample, she considered that it was his first time applying for a clearance and that he reimbursed \nCompany A for the fuel. She also acknowledged the timing of his admissions in her mitigation \nanalysis. Although the Government may disagree with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, that \nis insufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in an arbitrary or capricious \nmanner, and we find no reason to conclude that the Judge erred in her mitigation analysis under \nGuideline E. See ISCR Case No. 04-08975 at 1 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). \nWith respect to the Whole-Person Concept, the Judge found that Applicant \u201clearned from \nhis mistakes and is unlikely to repeat the conduct in the future.\u201d Decision at 7. We find the Judge\u2019s \nWhole-Person determination in this regard to be adequately based on both objective and subjective \nevidence that the Judge clearly articulated in her list of considered facts when examining the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The Judge\u2019s analysis explicitly enumerated the evidence \nthat she used to support her Whole-Person assessment including the disqualifying conduct, his \nrecent employment history, and his letters of recommendation, among other considerations. Again, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhile the Government may disagree with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, the Judge\u2019s \nanalysis was reasonable and supported by the record. \nThe Government failed to establish the Judge committed harmful error. None of the \narguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence \nor sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 19, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).1 On \nSeptember 2, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. \nDorsey denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, Applicant provided additional explanations for her delinquent debt, asserted \nthat her financial problems were temporary, and claimed they have since been fully resolved. \nAppeal Brief at 2. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n1 The SOR identified Applicant via her married name. The Government\u2019s FORM and the Judge\u2019s decision identify \nher via her maiden name. There is nothing in the record that explains the change in last names between these pleadings. \nIn all other record documents, including her Appeal Brief, Applicant has identified herself using her married name, \nand the Board\u2019s decision is captioned accordingly. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant, in her early 40s, earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2005 and a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2019. She married in 2012 and legally separated in 2015. She served on active duty with the \nNavy from 2006 to 2012 and was honorably discharged. She has three minor children. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totalling approximately \n$53,000. Applicant admitted six of the allegations with explanation (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, \nand 1.h) and denied two allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g). The Judge held adversely on all \nallegations, while noting that the balance of the delinquent account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f was \n$12,262 instead of the alleged $23,564. \nOn Appeal, Applicant argued that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h were disputed \nand removed from her credit report as of her April 2025 credit report (Government Exhibit 6). \nHowever, the Judge considered this in his decision, noting: \u201cHer reliance on debts no longer \nappearing on her credit report, without more, does not provide evidence of mitigation.\u201d Decision \nat 6. This analysis is well-rooted in the Appeal Board precedent to which he cites. The Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that Applicant did not mitigate the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h is adequately \nsupported by the record. \nPredominantly, Applicant\u2019s brief requested reconsideration of the Judge\u2019s decision. To that \nend, she provided additional details about the circumstances that led to the alleged debts and about \nher current personal, professional, and financial situation. She also offered three new letters of \nrecommendation. The Appeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nWe find that the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s circumstances and debt resolution efforts in \nhis decision and reasonably concluded that Applicant had not established a sufficient record of \npayments and responsible financial conduct. Applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient \nto demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-17409, 2007 WL 4105312 at *2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to mitigate the \nfinancial security concerns is sustainable. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Rather, the Judge examined and weighed the disqualifying and mitigating \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The record is sufficient to \nsupport that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

The Judge found favorably on a $540 debt that was resolved \nand adversely on all remaining allegations. On appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to \nconsider certain exhibits and his response to the financial problems, and that she improperly \nconsidered his child custody case. For the following reasons, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant first argues that the Judge \u201coverlooked pertinent exhibits\u201d including Exhibits A, \nB, D, and E, which he contends demonstrate his debt resolution efforts and responsible action \nwarranting a finding of mitigation. Appeal Brief at 4. To the extent that Applicant is arguing that \nthe Judge either failed to consider these exhibits in their entirety or failed to afford them sufficient \nmitigating weight, both arguments are unpersuasive. \nThe identified exhibits pertain to two debts for which the Judge found adversely, including \na utility account placed for collection for approximately $4,400 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and an automobile \nloan charged off for approximately $9,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).1 Although he disclosed neither debt on \nhis security clearance application, Applicant discussed both during his July 2022 clearance \ninterview, at which time he acknowledged his awareness of them and lack of resolution efforts to-\ndate. Government Exhibit (GE) 5 at 2, 4. Still, Applicant took no action to resolve the debts until \nafter his SOR was issued. \nTurning first to the $9,100 auto loan, the record reflects that Applicant contacted the \ncreditor on January 11, 2024 \u2013 two days after the SOR was issued \u2013 and established a $1,360 \nsettlement to be paid in twelve monthly installments of about $114. AE A.2 With the exception of \nthe one due in May, Applicant made payments as required beginning in January 2024. AE D at 3; \nAE E. In her decision, the Judge summarized the foregoing and found that the \u201cdebt is in the \nprocess of being paid.\u201d Decision at 4. \nWith respect to the $4,400 utility debt, the record reflects that the creditor extended \nApplicant an $890 settlement offer on July 10, 2024. AE G. On or about August 13 \u2013 one week \nprior to the hearing in this matter \u2013 Applicant established a settlement to resolve the debt in two \npayments of about $445, the first of which was paid on August 15, leaving the second due on \nSeptember 13. AE B; AE F at 2. Here again, the Judge summarized this chronology and found that \nthe \u201cdebt currently remains owing but is in the process of being paid.\u201d Decision at 3. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the decision makes clear that the Judge considered \nExhibits A, B, D, and E and the debt resolution efforts they revealed. She ultimately concluded, \nhowever, that despite his recent efforts at financial responsibility, Applicant failed to address his \ndebt \u201cuntil he was required to apply for a security clearance\u201d and \u201che has not sufficiently resolved \nenough of his delinquent debt to demonstrate a sustained systematic method of payment.\u201d Decision \nat 7. It is well settled that the timing of debt resolution efforts is an important factor in evaluating \nmitigation \u201cbecause an applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow \nrules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). Here, despite knowing about them since at least \nJuly 2022, Applicant\u2019s efforts to address the alleged debts began only after the SOR was issued. \nNot only did Applicant\u2019s recent timing impact upon the degree to which his efforts were deemed \n1 Exhibit D also contains evidence supporting Applicant\u2019s payment efforts for the $540 consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d), \nwhich the Judge concluded was \u201cresolved . . . in full\u201d and found in Applicant\u2019s favor. Decision at 3-4; Applicant \nExhibit (AE) D at 2, 4. \n2 Although the Judge erroneously cited Exhibit A following her summary of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a, her \nsummary of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g accurately includes the information reflected in Exhibit A and it is clear \nthat the Judge considered the exhibit along with the correct debt. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nvoluntary (i.e., not driven by his security clearance process), but the recency also impacted upon \nhis ability to establish a sufficient track record of repayment.

Jun. 11, 2003). The Judge did not find that Applicant\u2019s payments amounted to such a \nmeaningful track record, and her conclusion that Applicant\u2019s efforts were insufficient to fully \nmitigate the financial concerns is reasonable and sustainable. \nFinally, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s reference to a child custody case involving his \nnon-biological son, which he contends is irrelevant to his eligibility for a security clearance and \nimproperly implies \u201cpotential character concerns.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. In the factual findings \nportion of her decision, the Judge indeed summarized Applicant\u2019s legal case, but only after first \nnoting that \u201cApplicant also still owes his attorney about $1,500 in legal fees.\u201d Decision at 4. There \nis no further mention of the custody case in the decision, and it appears that the Judge was simply \nexplaining the basis for Applicant\u2019s outstanding legal fees \u2013 another financial obligation that is \nproperly considered in the full picture of Applicant\u2019s outstanding debts and his ability to repay \nthem. We find no error in this regard. \nThere is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of \ndemonstrating that the judge committed factual or legal error. See ISCR Case No. 00-0050, 2001 \nWL 1044490 at *1 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2001).

He served in the U.S. \nmilitary from June 2001 until his honorable discharge in June 2005, during which time he deployed \ntwice to Iraq. He initially received a 50% disability rating for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD); however, in 2008, he appealed and received a combined 100% disability rating based on, \namong other things, PTSD and traumatic brain injury (TBI). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBetween 2005 and 2013, Applicant sought treatment from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs but found the prescribed narcotics ineffective and the counselors not helpful. He obtained \na prescription for medical marijuana under his residential state law in 2013 and has used that \nprescription to manage his PTSD, anxiety, depression, and pain from injuries sustained in combat, \nto include his TBI. \nIn his June 2023 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he began \nusing marijuana in 2013 and had a prescription for medical marijuana to treat PTSD. He described \nusing the drug daily and acknowledged that he intended to use it in the future. In his October 2023 \nresponse to interrogatories, Applicant disclosed that he continued to use marijuana to-date and \nacknowledged his understanding that marijuana use remains illegal under federal law and that \nfuture use may affect his security eligibility. Despite that awareness and potential consequence, he \nreiterated his intention to continue using marijuana in the future. \nBased on the foregoing, the SOR alleged that Applicant had used marijuana since 2013, \nincluding after submitting his SCA, and that he intended to continue to use marijuana in the future. \nIn his February 2024 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation, including his \ncontinued marijuana use to-date and intentions for future use. He explained that his use was \nresponsible, in accordance with local regulations, and did not affect his job performance or security \nresponsibilities. \nDuring his August 2024 hearing, Applicant testified that he would consider abstaining from \nfuture marijuana use if it meant he could obtain his clearance and stated that he intended to work \nwith his private doctors and VA care providers to find alternative means to manage his PTSD, \nanxiety, depression, and pain. At the end of the hearing, the Judge offered to keep the record open, \nbut Applicant declined because there was nothing he needed to add, and the record was closed. \nAlmost six months later, in February 2025, Applicant requested that the record be reopened to \nsubmit additional evidence, and the Government did not object. As post-hearing evidence, \nApplicant submitted a statement noting that, \u201cI have limited my use strictly to weekends for the \npast couple of months and I intend to discontinue use entirely.\u201d Applicant Exhibit C. \nAfter finding Applicant\u2019s conduct disqualifying under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c), the Judge \nnoted favorably that Applicant self-reported and openly discussed his marijuana use, and he \n\u201cmaintained he did not truly understand that marijuana, which is federally illegal, would impact \nhis security clearance eligibility and provided no exceptions for medical marijuana use until he \nunderwent the security clearance process.\u201d Decision at 6. Despite the mitigative impact of his \ncandor and circumstances, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s lengthy period of marijuana use \ncoupled with his continued use for months after his hearing, all with awareness of its federal \nillegality and security implications, precluded full mitigation of the Guideline H concern. \nOn appeal, Applicant charges that the Judge\u2019s analyses of the mitigating conditions and \nWhole-Person Concept failed to fully consider the \u201climited and medically authorized\u201d \ncircumstances of his marijuana use to address \u201cserious health issues incurred while serving [his] \ncountry.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Applicant\u2019s emphasis on the combat-related and state-compliant \ncircumstances underlying his marijuana use \u2013 both of which were fully considered in the Judge\u2019s \ndecision \u2013 is misplaced. It is not necessarily his history of marijuana use that raises questions about \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis judgment and reliability, but rather his persisting in that behavior while aware that using \nmarijuana is inconsistent with holding national security eligibility.

Sep. 14, 2021). The Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s continued marijuana use after repeated acknowledgments of the \nsecurity implications thereof casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment \nis well-supported by Appeal Board precedent and sustainable. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Our review of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence \nand articulated a satisfactory and sustainable explanation for the decision. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Dept. of Navy v.

Instead, Applicant argues broadly that the Judge \u201cmade his decision based on [his] past\u201d and did not give appropriate weight to his recent efforts to mitigate the security concerns. Appeal Brief at 1. It is well settled, however, that the timing of debt resolution efforts is an important factor in evaluating mitigation \u201cbecause an applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd.

On February 18, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant national security eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged seven financial concerns: that Applicant is indebted to the federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $16,300; that he is indebted to his \nstate of residence for approximately $29,100 in delinquent taxes; and that he has five consumer \naccounts that have been charged off, with delinquent debt totaling about $12,000. Under Guideline \nE, the SOR alleged various disciplinary actions at prior employers. The Judge found favorably for \nApplicant on the Guideline E allegations and on the Guideline F consumer debt allegations, but \nadversely on the two allegations of federal and state tax delinquencies. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn concluding that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his tax \ndelinquencies, the Judge highlighted several factors, including: that Applicant\u2019s most recent \npayment plans with both tax authorities were made after the SOR was issued; that he has paid the \nstate tax authority approximately $3,100 on a $26,000 tax debt; and that, in 2024, Applicant paid \nthe IRS $200 on a $21,000 federal tax debt. Noting that Applicant has had delinquent federal and \nstate income taxes for more than ten years, the Judge concluded that these payments were \ninsufficient to establish the requisite \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d for either debt. Decision at 13. \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Instead, Applicant \nargues broadly that the Judge \u201cmade his decision based on [his] past\u201d and did not give appropriate \nweight to his recent efforts to mitigate the security concerns. Appeal Brief at 1. It is well settled, \nhowever, that the timing of debt resolution efforts is an important factor in evaluating mitigation \n\u201cbecause an applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice \nthat his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and \nregulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). Similarly, the Board has long held that, until an applicant \nhas a \u201cmeaningful financial track record,\u201d it cannot be said \u201cthat he has initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 11, 2003). The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s recent efforts were insufficient to establish \nsuch a track record or fully mitigate the financial concerns was well-grounded in the Appeal Board \nprecedent to which he cites. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief merely advocates for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence. An applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability \nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our \nreview of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of the Navy v.

White, Esq., Department Counsel \nAndrea M. Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 16, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nFebruary 25, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross \ngranted Applicant national security eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his early 40s. His childhood was difficult, \u201cwith a father who was an \nalcoholic, and a mother who was a multi-drug abuser,\u201d and he testified to a cycle of incarceration, \n\n \n \ndrug use, and living on the street. Decision at 5. Regarding the conduct and concerns alleged in \nthe SOR, the Judge summarized that \u201cApplicant was, until 2016, a career criminal.\u201d Id. \nUnder Guideline H and Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged various illegal drug use, \nincluding opioids from 2007 to August 2012, methamphetamine from 1999 until August 2012, and \nmarijuana from 1995 through March 2023. Applicant was also arrested three times in August 2001 \nfor being under the influence of a controlled substance and, on the third occasion, was convicted \nand sentenced to one year in jail. \nUnder Guideline J and Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged a significant history of criminal \nconduct, beginning in 1998 with a conviction following arrest for burglary and grand theft of \nfirearms for which Applicant, then a juvenile, was sentenced to six months at a youth center. The \nJudge noted that, \u201c[f]rom that time, until approximately 2016, he was either in prison, on probation, \nor on parole\u201d for a variety of property, weapons, violent, and drug offenses. Id. at 3. In two 2012 \narrests, Applicant was charged with possession of a loaded firearm and multiple counts of \npossession of methamphetamine and sentenced for the combined offenses to four years in prison. \nAs addressed more fully, below, Applicant explained that he had an epiphany at this point and \nbegan improving himself. \nIn January 2020, Applicant was charged with assault by means likely to cause great bodily \nharm after he got into a physical altercation with a coworker, whom Applicant punched several \ntimes. He was placed on informal probation for three years and required to engage in various \nservices. He successfully completed probation and is no longer on any restriction. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s conduct was disqualifying but, through application of \nboth the mitigating conditions and the Whole-Person Concept, resolved all concerns favorably. \nScope of Review \nThe Board does not review a case de novo. Rather, the Board addresses the material issues \nraised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal error. There is no presumption \nof error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how \nthe judge committed factual or legal error. \nWhen a judge\u2019s ruling or conclusions are challenged, we must determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. A judge\u2019s decision can be arbitrary \nor capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory \nexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion. See ISCR Case No. 95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). In deciding \nwhether a judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they \nare contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, the Government argues that the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions \nand his analysis under the Whole-Person Concept were arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and \nnot supported by the record evidence. For the following reasons, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe nature of this case warrants that we address at the outset the Whole-Person Concept, \nwhich requires that eligibility determinations be made through a careful weighing of multiple \nvariables of an applicant\u2019s life using all \u201cavailable, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3; AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(d). \nThe Government charges that the Judge\u2019s Whole-Person analysis is flawed because he \u201cdid \nnot cite to any new relevant facts in finding the established security concerns mitigated\u201d \nthereunder. Appeal Brief at 25. Analysis under the Whole-Person Concept need not be conducted \nseparately or distinctly from analysis under applicable Guidelines. To the contrary, the Directive \nrequires that the Guidelines be evaluated in the context of the whole person. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nThis case is unquestionably unique, both in terms of the extent of Applicant\u2019s criminal and \ndrug use histories, as well as his exceptional efforts at rehabilitation. Under these unique \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s cases in mitigation under the three Guidelines are inextricably linked \nto analysis of his whole person. This is well-represented in the Judge\u2019s decision, in which \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s whole person is woven throughout. \nOf the general factors to consider in evaluating alleged conduct and the whole person, \nrehabilitation is particularly relevant in this matter. The Judge attempted to summarize the record\u2019s \nmost significant evidence of rehabilitation, but also noted that the \u201cdecision can barely touch on \nthe voluminous evidence in the record showing how [Applicant] was able to rise above a very \nchallenging childhood and adolescence, followed by an adulthood of crime, to be the person he is \ntoday.\u201d Decision at 10. To that end, we note the following information drawn from the decision \nand record: \nDuring his final period of incarceration beginning in 2012, Applicant became a Christian \nand began receiving an education. Although he was sentenced to four years of incarceration, he \nwas released to probation early in 2015. Applicant testified that his subsequent release from \nsupervision in 2016 \u2013 at the age of about 33 \u2013 was the first time he had been free of incarceration, \nparole, and probation since he was 15. He married in 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s fisticuffs in January 2020 resulted in an assault charge; however, impressed by \nthe changes that Applicant had already made in his life, the presiding judge put him on informal \nprobation for three years. During that time, he engaged in various services to address anger \nmanagement and to resolve personal issues that had affected him most of his life. For over two \nyears, he attended one-on-one therapy with a psychologist, who submitted a letter on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf and concluded: \n3 \n\n \nI think that [Applicant] is currently at a point of social, emotional, \nand cognitive development that is significantly above average \ncompared to other males his same age. This is a remarkable \nimprovement and achievement. In my opinion he is no longer a \nthreat to others but a mature individual with good values, the ability \nto handle well the stress and difficulties in life and be there for others \nnow that others have been there for him. \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) E at 2 (emphasis in original). \nApplicant also continued his education and earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nscience in 2022, graduating with a 3.919 GPA, the highest in his class. One of Applicant\u2019s former \nprofessors identified him as a leader among students, a reliable and honest student, and a hard\u00ad\nworking and dedicated computer scientist. Another former instructor advocated for Applicant\u2019s \nemployment with his company, which knew of Applicant\u2019s background, and Applicant has been \nemployed there as a software engineer since mid-2021. The company\u2019s president commented on \nApplicant\u2019s strong performance ratings, absence of security incidents, reliability, and \ndependability. \nApplicant has also been involved in helping at-risk youth and instructing future law \nenforcement officers. The Chief Deputy Probation Officer of the county where Applicant used to \nlive, who has known him since at least 2017 and recounted him speaking to her classes and at \njuvenile hall, praised Applicant by noting: \nAs an instructor and a Chief Deputy Probation Officer, I teach \nstudents and officers that one must believe offenders have the ability \nto change. . . . [Applicant] exemplifies this belief. I\u2019m very proud of \nhis progress and he is a reminder of why I have chosen the career I \nhave. \nAE R. The Judge concluded his favorable decision by opining that \u201cApplicant is an impressive \nman who has truly turned his life around after a start that would have crushed most people.\u201d \nDecision at 12. \nIn addition to, and implicit in, his robust discussion of rehabilitation, the decision reflects \nthat the Judge evaluated Applicant\u2019s case through other relevant general factors, including his age \nand maturity, the recency of and circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the likelihood of \nrecurrence. The Judge thoroughly addressed the record\u2019s unfavorable evidence alongside the \nfavorable evidence supporting mitigation and Applicant\u2019s whole person, and reasonably concluded \nthat the favorable was sufficient to overcome the security concerns. The Government\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s evaluation of this case under the Whole-Person Concept and the \ngeneral factors of AG \u00b6 2(d) is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \n4 \n\n \n \nGuideline H \nThe Judge found that Applicant used methamphetamine and opioids during the period \nwhen he was in and out of prison but stopped in 2012 \u201cwhen he decided to turn his life around,\u201d \nand that his marijuana use continued until 2023. Decision at 9. Relying on Applicant\u2019s assertions \nthat he no longer uses any illegal substances and his demonstrated changed circumstances, the \nJudge concluded that the Guideline H concerns were mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b).1 The \nGovernment challenges the Judge\u2019s favorable mitigation analysis as based primarily on an \nerroneous credibility determination and unsupported factual findings, and argues that the Judge \nfailed to sufficiently consider that Applicant has \u201cnever participated in any consistent substance \nabuse programs\u201d and that he used marijuana after submitting his security clearance application \n(SCA). Appeal Brief at 17. These arguments are of mixed merit. \nFirst, regarding his lack of drug counseling, Applicant acknowledged that he was required \nto attend substance abuse counseling during his periods of parole and probation, but that he did \nnot take it seriously until 2012.2 The record reflects that Applicant\u2019s methamphetamine-related \nconduct3 and his use of opioids4 occurred during a prior, albeit significant, criminal stage of his \nlife and that he ceased involvement with both drugs in 2012.5 As of his hearing, Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence from methamphetamine and opioids had continued for over twelve years. The \nGovernment seems to suggest that, despite the lengthy period of voluntary abstinence from these \ntwo serious drugs, Applicant\u2019s failure to fully engage in counseling before 2012 leaves room for \ndoubt about his sincerity or ability to sustain abstinence in the future. We are unpersuaded by such \nan argument. Considering both the passage of time since Applicant used either of those drugs and \nthe breadth of evidence of considerable and lasting positive changes that he has made since 2012, \nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s non-marijuana drug involvement is mitigated is amply \nsupported by the record and Appeal Board precedent.6 \nWith respect to this marijuana use, the record reflects that Applicant began using the drug \nin the 1990s and continued using infrequently until about 2010. He resumed in 2016 when \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. \n2 See GE 1 at 58; Tr. at 56. Beyond Applicant\u2019s general recollection of having not taken counseling seriously, the \nrecord is not clear what types, frequencies, or durations of counseling were included in his terms of supervision, nor \nis there evidence that any of those terms remain open or unsuccessful. \n3 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 2.b, 2.c, 2.f-2.h. Applicant asserted that his arrests involving controlled substances were, to the \nbest of his recollection, for methamphetamine. GE 2 at 17. \n4 SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n5 GE 1 at 58; GE 2 at 18; Tr. at 53. \n6 To the extent that the Government is advocating that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, which continued until March 2023, \nshould revive the concerns about his otherwise-mitigated methamphetamine and opioid use, we disagree that such an \nanalysis is appropriate under the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is distinguishable from his use of \nmethamphetamine and opioids, particularly considering the comparative legality under state law, nature, recency, and \ncircumstances of use. See ISCR Case No. 24-00914 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2025) (discussing the analysis in cases \nalleging mixed drug use). \n5 \n\n \n \n \nrecreational marijuana was legalized in his residential state and described himself as a weekly user \nuntil around the time that he submitted his October 2022 SCA. Applicant used marijuana several \nmore times in early 2023 and ceased again in March 2023. \nTo the extent that the Government is arguing that Applicant\u2019s lack of substance abuse \ncounseling calls into question his future marijuana abstinence and undermines the Judge\u2019s \nmitigation analysis, we are again unpersuaded. Satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug \ntreatment program is a condition that affords mitigative credit in Guideline H cases, 7 but it is not \nthe only path to mitigation, nor is it a required step on that path.8 \nThe Government\u2019s appeal takes greater aim at the Judge\u2019s failure to sufficiently consider \ncertain significant contrary evidence \u2013 i.e., Applicant\u2019s post-SCA marijuana use \u2013 which carries \nimplications to both Applicant\u2019s judgment and his latest promise to abstain. This argument has \nsome merit. \nAfter disclosing his prior marijuana use in his October 2022 SCA, Applicant averred that \nhe had no intention of using it in the future, citing the drug\u2019s illegal status under federal law and \nnot wanting to lose his job or potential security clearance. About three months later, however, he \nused marijuana several more times between January and March 2023. Applicant reported his \nadditional use to the security investigator in March 2023 and stated again that he had no intention \nof using in the future. Applicant\u2019s marijuana cessation date has since remained fixed in March \n2023, and he has reiterated his intentions against future use. \nApplicant\u2019s post-SCA marijuana use occurred with knowledge that it was inconsistent with \nnational security eligibility, raising questions about his judgment and reliability,9 and also \nundercuts his renewed statement against future marijuana use. 10 These were significant matters to \nbe addressed by the Judge in determining if Applicant had met his burden of persuasion in both \nmitigation and the Whole-Person. The decision, however, is silent to Applicant\u2019s promise made in \nhis SCA that he would not use marijuana again or that, several months later, he did. \nLeaning on the Whole-Person Concept, the Judge concluded generally that Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use was mitigated and addressed Applicant\u2019s commitment to abstinence by finding \nsimply that his \u201ctestimony and other evidence showed someone who has truly changed his attitude \nabout marijuana and can be depended upon not to use it in the future.\u201d Decision at 9. The Judge\u2019s \nsparse analysis about Applicant\u2019s post-SCA marijuana use is, on its face, insufficient. The Judge \nshould have more explicitly addressed how Applicant\u2019s post-SCA marijuana use weighed in \nassessing Applicant\u2019s judgment and why he found Applicant\u2019s renewed statement against future \nuse reliable considering the similar promise Applicant made, and broke, earlier in his investigation. \n7 See AG \u00b6 26(d). \n8 The absence of a specific mitigating condition that is applicable to the facts of a case does not preclude a judge from \nmaking a favorable decision. See ISCR Case No. 03-12882 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005). \n9 See ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021) (The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who \nuse marijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the \njudgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d). \n10 ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \nThat said, the Board does not measure a judge\u2019s decision against a standard of perfection, \nbut rather reviews it as a whole to determine if there is error. DISCR OSD Case No. 90-1054, 1992 \nWL 388310 at *4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 1992) (citations omitted). Post-SCA marijuana use is a \nconsideration in, but not a bar to, eligibility. Looking to the Judge\u2019s otherwise thorough mitigation \nanalysis and weighty reliance on the Whole-Person Concept, his basis for finding Applicant\u2019s post-\nSCA marijuana use mitigated is evident. Applicant\u2019s post-SCA use occurred only a few times, \npermissibly under state law and early in his investigation when he believed he would not be granted \neligibility, and Applicant promptly and voluntarily disclosed the use to his investigator. The Judge \nfound Applicant\u2019s March 2023 cessation date credible11 and, as of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence from marijuana had continued for over fifteen months. Considering the decision in its \nentirety, we conclude that the Judge adequately addressed Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and his basis \nfor finding Applicant\u2019s renewed promise to abstain credible is supported by the record. Any error \nresulting from his not explicitly addressing the post-SCA use was harmless. \nGuideline J \nThe Government next charges that \u201cthe Judge erroneously concluded that the Guideline J \nconcerns were sufficiently mitigated under [AG \u00b6\u00b6] 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d),\u201d and argues that his \nanalysis was flawed \u201cbecause he undertook a narrow, piecemeal approach in which he minimized, \nor completely ignored, the security significance of the totality of the facts when weighed in context \nwith each other.\u201d Appeal Brief at 18. \nTurning first to AG \u00b6 32(c), which affords mitigation when there is \u201cno reliable evidence \nto support that the individual committed the offense,\u201d the Government argues that \u201cthere was no \nreasonable ground upon which to apply [the condition], and the Judge\u2019s use of it is wholly \ninappropriate.\u201d Id. The Judge did not apply AG \u00b6 32(c) and this argument is moot. \nThe Government also contends that the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d)12 was erroneous, based largely on what it describes as an overemphasis on the \npassage of time since Applicant\u2019s last criminal charge in January 2020. To that end, the Judge \nassessed that: \n11 The Government argues that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after stating he had no future intent and after submitting \nhis SCA detracts from a favorable credibility assessment in terms of Applicant\u2019s renewed statement against future \nuse. The Appeal Board gives deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determinations and a party challenging such a \ndetermination has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant was forthcoming about \nhis unfavorable information throughout his investigation and adjudication and there is no evidence that his March \n2023 marijuana cessation date is false. The Judge had the opportunity to personally observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor at \nhearing and could form impressions about the credibility of his testimony based on those observations, which are \nbolstered by numerous personal, professional, and academic references. The Government\u2019s disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s favorable credibility assessment is not sufficient to meet its heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. \n12 AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has truly turned his life around. This decision can barely \ntouch on the voluminous evidence in the record showing how this \nman was able to rise above a very challenging childhood and \nadolescence, followed by an adulthood of crime, to be the person he \nis today. Faith, education, and the ability of people to see through \nthe gangster he was to the fine and upstanding man he now is. The \nincident in 2020 was brought about, at least in part, by his not fully \ncommitting to the lifestyle he has now chosen. However, he has had \nsuccessful therapy, he has a good job where he is respected, he is \nmarried, and he has friends. What is truly compelling is that a chief \ndeputy probation officer has used Applicant to educate prospective \nlaw enforcement officers and juveniles about how a person\u2019s life can \nchange for the better. \nDecision at 10. While the mitigation analysis addressed, in relatively minor part, that Applicant\u2019s \nlast criminal charge occurred in 2020, it focused more heavily on Applicant\u2019s changed \ncircumstances and efforts at rehabilitation since that incident. The Judge\u2019s analytical focus was \nappropriately placed.13 \nThe Government also argues that the record contains a \u201cpaucity of mitigating evidence\u201d to \ncorroborate Applicant having \u201cturned his life around.\u201d Appeal Brief at 20 (quoting Decision at \n10). This argument is puzzling considering the sheer breadth of evidence in this case supporting \nApplicant\u2019s rehabilitation. In applying AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d), the Judge identified the positive \nchanges that Applicant has made since the 2020 assault charge, as reflected not only in Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, but in numerous substantive reference letters from a variety of sources, which weighed \nheavily in the Judge\u2019s finding of rehabilitation. The Judge opined that the 2020 incident \u201cwas \nbrought about, at least in part, by [Applicant] not fully committing to the lifestyle he has now \nchosen,\u201d and cited Applicant\u2019s subsequent successful therapy and professional development for \nmitigation. Decision at 10. \nThe Government next challenges that Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation is further undercut by the \nabsence of \u201cmeaningful aspects of that change.\u201d Appeal Brief at 21. The \u201cmeaningful aspect\u201d that \nthe Government appears to find lacking is, once again, evidence of substance abuse counseling, \nwhich it contends \u201cwould bear favorably on the issues of mitigating [sic] or rehabilitation.\u201d Id. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fully engage in whatever substance abuse counseling may have been \nincluded in his various terms of parole and probation is a matter properly considered under the \ndisqualifying conditions, which the Judge did when he applied AG \u00b6 31(d) and found that \n\u201cApplicant was a career criminal until 2012.\u201d Decision at 9. It does not, however, bar mitigation \nof the criminal conduct concerns or an overall favorable finding. See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at \n2 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006) (\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole \nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular \n13 See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004) (\u201cThe sufficiency or insufficiency of an applicant\u2019s \nperiod of conduct without recurrence of past misconduct does not turn on any bright-line rules concerning the length \nof time needed to demonstrate reform and rehabilitation, but rather a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances \nof an applicant\u2019s case based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence record within the parameters set by \nthe Directive.\u201d). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts of a case. Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the \nrecord evidence as a whole.\u201d). The absence of Applicant\u2019s participation in substance abuse \ncounseling does not detract from the Judge\u2019s sustainable Guideline J mitigation analysis. \nGuideline E \nAfter finding Applicant\u2019s cross-alleged conduct disqualifying under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e), \nthe Judge concluded that the Guideline E concerns were fully mitigated through application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(g) and referred simply to his analyses under Guidelines H and J. The \nGovernment challenges this as insufficient and a failure \u201cto conduct the requisite separate analysis \nunder Guideline E.\u201d Appeal Brief at 23. \nThe Government first contends that the Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines H and \nJ do not allow him to \u201cperfunctorily dismiss the associated Guideline E allegations.\u201d Id. We \ndisagree with the characterization of the Judge\u2019s resolution of the Guideline E case as \n\u201cperfunctory.\u201d To the contrary, the Judge relied on his thorough Guideline H and Guideline J \nanalyses to resolve the cross-alleged Guideline E case. As discussed more fully below, this reliance \nwas reasonable considering the commonalities of the underlying allegations in terms of timeframe, \ncircumstances, and the conduct\u2019s potential security significance. \nThe Government next argues that the Judge was required to \u201cconduct an \u2018independent and \nseparate analysis\u2019 regarding whether [the] behavior is mitigated under Guideline E.\u201d Id. We agree \nthat a judge must consider and evaluate an applicant\u2019s conduct under all Guidelines under which \nit has been alleged in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 01-03107 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2002). A \njudge is not required, however, to supply a new and distinct analysis under each Guideline to \nsufficiently address the concern, which is especially true in cases of cross-alleged conduct. \nIn the instant case, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s criminal history under Guideline J and his \ndrug use history under Guideline H and then simply cross-alleged everything under Guideline E. \nAs the Government correctly notes, the Board has long held that an applicant\u2019s security-related \nconduct may have independent weight under more than one Guideline. See DISCR OSD Case No. \n88-1198, 1992 WL 404179 at *11 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 1992). The mere fact that conduct is cross-\nalleged under Guideline E does not, however, automatically mean that it has independent weight \nunder Guideline E. Id. Rather, the Guidelines contemplate that behavior will have independent \nsecurity significance under Guideline E in a broad range of cases by focusing on the concepts of \nquestionable judgment and irresponsibility. See ISCR Case No. 06-20964 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. \n10, 2008) (citing AG \u00b6 2(e)).14 \nThe reliance on Guideline E as a mechanism through which to separately evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s judgment and responsibility, coupled with the requirement that cross-alleged conduct \ncarry independent weight, results in a strained Guideline E analysis when \u2013 as here \u2013 the underlying \nsecurity concerns are already rooted in questions about the individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, \n14 AG \u00b6 2(e): Although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable \neligibility determination, the individual may be found ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring \npattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.15 In this case, those matters \nwere substantively addressed in the Judge\u2019s Guideline H and Guideline J analyses, under which \nhe clearly articulated his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s conduct was mitigated under Guideline E \nthrough the passage of time (AG \u00b6 17(c)), his participation in counseling and demonstration of \nother positive life changes (AG \u00b6 17(d)), his positive steps to eliminate any vulnerability resulting \nfrom the conduct (AG \u00b6 17(e)), and his disassociation from criminal contacts (AG \u00b6 17(g)). While \na more detailed analysis of the applied conditions \u2013 both mitigating and disqualifying \u2013 would \nhave been preferable, under the facts of this case and upon consideration of the Judge\u2019s decision \nas a whole, we conclude that the Judge reasonably explained why Applicant\u2019s criminal and drug \nuse histories were not a security concern under Guideline E. \nConclusion \nThe Government has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all the \nevidence or shown that he weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. As the trier of fact, the Judge was required to weigh the evidence as a whole and \ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See \nISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 2. A review of the Judge\u2019s detailed decision persuades the Board that \nhe did not simply ignore or disregard record evidence adverse to Applicant. Indeed, the decision \nindicates the Judge acknowledged the adverse evidence and weighed it against the favorable. The \nGovernment\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for \na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Id. \nThe record supports that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person \nfactors. The decision is sustainable on the record. \n15 The security concern under Guideline H is that the \u201cillegal use of controlled substances can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness and raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 24. Similarly, the security concern under Guideline J is that \u201c[c]riminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. Both concerns can be mitigated through \na finding that, among other things, the behavior \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 32(a). \n10 \n\nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 23-02891 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nGrant Couch, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 2, 2024, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On December 3, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged six financial concerns related to Applicant\u2019s federal taxes: that Applicant \nfailed to pay her federal taxes for at least tax years 2018 through 2022 and that she owed varying \namounts for those five years, totaling approximately $17,500. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted all allegations, and the Judge found adversely to Applicant on all allegations. On appeal, \nApplicant asserts that the Judge failed to consider all the evidence in mitigation, rendering his \ndecision arbitrary and capricious. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her mid-forties and has held security clearances between 2008 and 2024. \nApplicant attributed her tax delinquencies to excessive exemptions that she took to cover medical \nbills. Although Applicant entered installment agreements with the IRS for tax years 2018 and \n2019, she allowed them to lapse without payments, and she did not enter agreements for tax years \n2020 through 2022. Applicant has, however, made payments totaling about $300 outside of \ninstallment agreements. Applicant is current with all of her other debts, earns $100,000 annually, \nand regularly contributes to a retirement plan. In light of Applicant\u2019s \u201crepeated failures or inability \nto address her federal tax-paying responsibilities in a timely way,\u201d the Judge concluded that \u201cnone \nof the potentially available mitigating conditions are available to her.\u201d Decision at 6, 7. \nDiscussion \nApplicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, she \ncontends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering \nall of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person \nconcept. She argues, for example, that the Judge did not give appropriate weight to the circumstances \nsurrounding the delinquencies and her ongoing efforts to resolve them. None of her arguments, \nhowever, are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the \nrecord. ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn asserting that the decision is arbitrary and capricious, Applicant is basically arguing for \nthe Judge to weigh the evidence differently. For example, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201centirely \nomits consideration of whether the incident creates the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. The Judge, however, explicitly addressed this issue, \nnoting that \u201c[w]hile the principal concern . . . is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment \nand trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts.\u201d Decision at 6. Applicant\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3. \nAdditionally, Applicant relies on hearing-level decisions in other cases to argue the Judge \nerred in his analysis of this case. As the Board has consistently stated, how particular fact \nscenarios were adjudicated in other cases is generally not a relevant consideration in the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s review of a case. None of the hearing-level decisions that Applicant cites are sufficient \nto show the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our \nreview of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of the Navy v.

The Judge concluded that Applicant \nfailed to demonstrate good judgment or responsibility and instead \u201cshow[ed] that he cannot be \ntrusted.\u201d Id. at 8\u20139. \nThrough counsel, Applicant avers that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant ignored \nmany of his debts for several years. He contends that this \u201cis simply not true\u201d and that \u2013 once \nApplicant became aware of these alleged debts during the clearance process \u2013 \u201che immediately \nbegan actively resolving each and every one of them.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. Applicant asserts that he \n\u201conly refused to pay debts that were not his debts and were incorrectly placed on his credit reports.\u201d \nId. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the record supports the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \nignored debts for several years. For example, Applicant disclosed two debts on his December 2020 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), noting that they arose in 2015 and 2016 respectively. FORM \nItem 3 at 50\u201352. Applicant did not resolve the debts, which are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.w., \nuntil October 2024, eight to nine years after the delinquencies accrued and six months after the \nSOR was issued. Decision at 3, 5. It is well settled that the timing of debt resolution efforts is an \nimportant factor in evaluating mitigation \u201cbecause an applicant who begins to resolve financial \nproblems only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his own interests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). \nThe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s recent efforts were insufficient to fully mitigate the \nfinancial concerns is reasonable and sustainable. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief merely advocates for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence. An applicant\u2019s \u201cdisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability \nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error.

On October 30, 2024, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided a copy to Applicant.

He highlights his military service and his work \nas a defense contractor since leaving active duty. Regarding the allegation of time fraud, Applicant \nreiterates his earlier denial, claiming that he was wrongly terminated after new technology \neliminated the need for his position and that the employer was using the allegation of timecard \nfraud as an \u201cexcuse.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2.

The employer\u2019s investigation included a review of the facility\u2019s badging \nrecords and Applicant\u2019s timecards, interviews with two witnesses, and an interview with \nApplicant, and it revealed significant discrepancies between Applicant\u2019s timesheets and his \npresence in the facility, totaling about 770 hours. The employer noted that Applicant \u201cdid not \nprovide a credible explanation\u201d for those discrepancies. Id. As a result of its investigation, the \nemployer refunded the government customer for the 770 hours charged. The Judge concluded that \n\u201c[Applicant\u2019s] employer established the reliability of its claims by reporting them to the DoD \nInspector General and repaying the Government for the monies Applicant was paid but failed to \nwork.\u201d Decision at 8\u20139. The Judge\u2019s deference to the employer\u2019s internal investigation is well-\ngrounded in the precedent to which he cites, and his conclusion that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concern raised by his timecard fraud is amply supported by the record. \nApplicant has failed to establish any harmful error below.

Additionally, \nApplicant challenges several of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and asserts that he misapplied the \nmitigation and Whole Person analyses. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings of fact are summarized below. \nApplicant is in his mid-sixties. He served on active duty and in the Reserve, earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2004, and has held a security clearance since that year. Married for over 30 \nyears, Applicant has two adult children. \nApplicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for at least TYs 2016 \nthrough 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d). In July 2017, Applicant completed a security clearance \napplication (SCA). Although he did not report his failure to file his 2016 federal and state income \ntax returns on his SCA, Applicant volunteered the information during his subsequent clearance \ninterview and stated that he had filed an extension. He ultimately filed the 2016 federal tax return \nin February 2021. \nIn response to Government interrogatories in August 2023, Applicant accepted full \nresponsibility for not filing his taxes in a timely manner and stated in explanation that he had \nmoved five times in the past seven years. Applicant\u2019s evidence confirms the following: that he \nsubsequently filed his federal returns for TYs 2018 through 2021 in January 2024; that he filed his \nMaryland state tax returns for TYs 2016 through 2021 in February 2024; and that he also filed his \nCalifornia state tax return for TY 2017 in February 2024. \nUpon receipt and processing of the tax returns, Applicant\u2019s federal tax debt included: \n$5,247 for TY 2018; $15,235 for TY 2019; $4,895 for TY 2020; and $3,437 for TY 2021. His \n2023 tax refund was diverted to his arrearage, and Applicant\u2019s delinquency for TY 2019 was \nreduced to $13,691. Applicant is paying between $5,000 and $6,000 a year to pay off his $23,000 \nfederal tax debt, but he does not have a payment plan. Applicant owes approximately $3,500 to \nMaryland and owes no taxes to California. As evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve his tax \ndebts, Applicant submitted canceled checks paid to the IRS and the Maryland state comptroller. \nThe checks were dated from May 2024 through November 2024 in amounts ranging from $25 to \n$75. \nApplicant drives a $60,000 luxury brand car, for which he has a $1,700 monthly payment, \nand his wife also drives a luxury brand car. Both cars were bought in 2017, and his wife\u2019s car was \npaid off in 2019. The couple has a combined annual salary of $240,000. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nThe Judge determined that the following disqualifying conditions were established: AG \u00b6 \n19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations; and AG \u00b6 19(f), failure to file or fraudulently \nfiling annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn examining the potentially applicable mitigating conditions, the Judge determined that \nnone was fully established, as detailed below:   \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant documented that he had \nrecently filed his remaining outstanding Federal and state income tax \nreturns in January 2024 and February 2024 respectively, which \nincluded the years alleged of 2018 through 2021. His behavior was \nrecent, not infrequent, and he filed his Federal and state income tax \nreturns only after his security clearance was in jeopardy, which casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The diversion of his federal income \ntax refund to pay his Federal tax debt does not constitute good-faith \nefforts to resolve the debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant has not made \narrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the \namounts owed. Applicant has made recent voluntary payments \ntowards his tax debts and also relied upon diversion of his tax refund \nto pay the amounts owed. [Decision at 6 (internal citation omitted.] \nThe Judge highlighted that Applicant acknowledged his failure to file his TY 2016 returns \nduring his 2017 SCA process, that he told the investigator he had filed an extension, and that \nApplicant did not file the tax returns until several years later. Additionally, the Judge noted that \nApplicant filed his overdue federal and state income tax returns only after he realized that his \nclearance was in jeopardy. In concluding that Applicant had not mitigated the alleged security \nconcerns, the Judge relied on Appeal Board precedent that the timing of remedial actions is a factor \nto be considered and that actions taken after one is on notice of security clearance concerns may \nbe due less weight. \nDiscussion \nThrough appellate counsel, Applicant first asserts that his previous attorney rendered \nineffective assistance of counsel at several stages of his clearance adjudication, to include: \nsubmitting an inadequate Answer to the SOR, asking a damaging question at the hearing, failing \nto object to a purportedly improper line of cross-examination, and failing to submit additional \ndocuments in mitigation post-hearing. In support of this argument, appellate counsel cites both to \nthe Supreme Court\u2019s standard for ineffective assistance in a criminal case and to its recent \napplication in a military court-martial, and he requests that the Board \u201cgrant him a Trial De Novo \nin order to receive a fair trial.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5-6. DOHA proceedings are civil in nature, and \napplicants are therefore not entitled to the procedural protections afforded to criminal defendants \nin either civilian or military prosecutions. E.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04623 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, \n2006). Appellate counsel\u2019s arguments regarding ineffective assistance are misplaced and without \nmerit. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nNext, Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in his findings of fact regarding particular tax \nyears. Appeal Brief at 9, quoting Decision at 2. Our review of the decision reveals that appellate \ncounsel is challenging as erroneous a paragraph in which the Judge listed Applicant\u2019s admissions \nto the SOR allegations, as reflected in Applicant\u2019s Answer. We conclude that this assignment of \nerror is baseless and decline to address the particular \u201cerrors\u201d that appellate counsel identifies. \nFinally, Applicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigation and Whole Person \ncriteria was arbitrary and capricious. A judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious \nif \u201cit does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \nconclusions, including a rational connection between the facts and the choice made; [it] does not \nconsider relevant factors; [it] reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important \naspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; \nor [it] is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n95-0600, 1996 WL 480993 at *3 (App. Bd. May 16, 1996) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nIn asserting that the decision is arbitrary and capricious, however, Applicant is simply \narguing for the Judge to weigh the evidence differently. For example, Applicant argues repeatedly \nthat the Judge failed to give appropriate weight to the fact that Applicant timely filed his returns \nfor 40 years\u2014from 1976 until 2016\u2014and instead gave undue weight to Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file for TYs 2016 through 2021. Appeal Brief at 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14. We note first that there \nis no actual record evidence of Applicant\u2019s compliance with tax authorities from 1976 until 2016. \nRegardless, an applicant\u2019s disagreement with the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to \nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nSimilarly, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to give appropriate weight to his ongoing \nefforts to resolve his delinquent tax issues. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant took \nremedial action only after being placed on notice of the Government\u2019s security concern is \nsupported by record evidence, which confirms that Applicant filed his delinquent returns for TYs \n2017 through 2021 approximately five months after receipt of Government interrogatories \nregarding the same. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s determination to give those remedial actions \ncomparatively scant weight is well-grounded in the Appeal Board precedent to which he cited. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our \nreview of the record reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-00114 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: James B.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nDan Meyer, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 11, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing but subsequently \nasked that the matter be decided based upon the written record, without a hearing. The Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing the Government\u2019s evidence and \narguments. Applicant, who was represented by counsel, provided a 282-page response to the \nFORM. On December 12, 2024, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nJennifer I. Goldstein found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the Guideline H allegations and against \nhim under Guideline E. She denied Applicant security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6 \u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant asserts on appeal a broad range of errors, to include that the Judge erred both in \nher findings of fact and in her conclusions of law; that the Government failed to carry its burden \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof proof; and that the Judge\u2019s credibility determination was inaccurate. He also contests the Judge\u2019s \nwhole person analysis. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nBackground \nApplicant is in his early thirties and is an honorably discharged military veteran. Under \nGuideline H, the SOR alleged that he had used marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \ngummies. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that he falsified his responses to questions \nregarding his drug use on security clearance applications (SCA) in 2012 and 2022. In his 132-page \nSOR answer, applicant admitted the drug use and one of the falsifications but denied the other \nfalsification. He explained that the 2012 falsification was because he was concerned a truthful \nanswer would prevent him from enlisting in the military and claimed that the 2022 falsification \nwas the result of mistakenly checking a wrong box on the SCA. The Judge found the drug use to \nbe mitigated but concluded that \u201cApplicant intentionally failed to disclose his marijuana use on his \n2012 SCA and his THC gummy use on his 2022 SCA.\u201d Decision at 7. She found his explanation \nfor the 2022 falsification to be lacking in credibility. \nDiscussion \nErrors in Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s counsel asserts that the Judge erred both in her findings of fact, \nmaking \u201cfactual determinations which were wholly inaccurate and are not supported by the \nrecord,\u201d and in her conclusions of law. Appeal Brief at 9. For both assertions, Counsel states that \n\u201c[t]hese errors are delineated at [F], infra.\u201d Id. That section of Applicant\u2019s brief is captioned, \u201cThe \nFailure to Consider Significant Evidence\u201d and does not identify any errors of fact or law. Instead, \nit argues that certain evidence was \u201cincompletely analyzed.\u201d Id. at 11. Similar arguments are made \nin the \u201cPersonal Conduct\u201d section of Applicant\u2019s brief. Id. at 19-20. \nApplicant\u2019s challenge largely conflates \u201cfacts\u201d with \u201cconclusions.\u201d Regardless, however, \nof whether considered to be facts or conclusions, the allegations of error are without merit because \nthe Judge\u2019s factual findings and conclusions are amply supported by the record. Applicant merely \nis advocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. An applicant\u2019s disagreement with a \njudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence \nis not sufficient to demonstrate that the judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a \nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. E.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2007). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence. The mere presence of some favorable or mitigating evidence \ndoes not require the Judge to make an overall favorable determination in the face of disqualifying \nconduct such as Applicant\u2019s. \nBurden of Proof, Credibility Assessment, and Whole Person Analysis \nNext, Applicant\u2019s counsel challenges whether the Government met its burden of proof, \narguing that there is no proof of intent. He also argues that the Judge\u2019s credibility determination \nand whole person analysis are flawed. Appeal Brief at 9-10. In support of each of these assertions \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant, again, relies upon section \u201c[F], infra\u201d of his appeal brief. However, as discussed \nregarding Applicant\u2019s claimed errors of fact and law, section [F] does not support any of these \ncontentions and Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding credibility and whole person amount to a mere \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. \nUpon her review of the evidence in this case the Judge made several conclusions that \nreflected adversely on Applicant\u2019s credibility. Specifically, she concluded that \u201c[h]is claim that he \nmiss-clicked on \u2018No\u2019 in 2022 lacks credibility, given his intentional falsification of the same \nquestion in the past and his subsequent positive drug test.\u201d Decision at 7. She also noted that \n\u201c[w]hile Applicant voluntarily disclosed his drug use to the investigator, his disclosure was only \nafter his positive urinalysis.\u201d Id. The Directive requires the Appeal Board to give deference to a \njudge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Given the Judge\u2019s specific explanation \nfor why she found Applicant to be lacking in credibility, we find no reason to disturb her adverse \ncredibility assessment. \nApplicant\u2019s argument that there is no proof of intent appears to be rooted in the erroneous \nposition that intent \u201ccan not be inferred.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6, n.2. However, it is not mere speculation \nor surmise for a judge to make a finding of fact about an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind based \non circumstantial evidence. \u201cAs a practical matter, when an applicant denies that he or she engaged \nin a falsification, proof of the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind is rarely based on direct evidence, \nbut rather often must rely on circumstantial evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-15935 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 15, 2003). In this instance, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Government carried its burden of \nproof is well-supported by the record. \nHearing Office Cases \nIn his brief, Applicant\u2019s counsel cites to and summarizes 24 hearing-level decisions in prior \nGuideline E cases, including five Department of Energy Personnel Security Hearing cases. Appeal \nBrief at 21-35. Counsel\u2019s reliance on hearing-level decisions is misplaced because each case must \nbe judged on its own merits. AG \u00b6 2(b). As the Board has frequently stated, how particular fact \nscenarios were decided at the hearing level in other cases is generally not a relevant consideration \nin our review of a case. Only in rare situations \u2013 such as separate cases involving spouses, \ncohabitants, or partners in which the debts and the financial circumstances surrounding them are \nthe same \u2013 would the adjudication outcome in another case have any meaningful relevance in our \nreview of a case. The decisions that Applicant\u2019s counsel recites have no direct relationship or \nunique link to Applicant\u2019s case that would make them relevant here. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has failed to identify any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of \nthis case or in her decision. The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant \ndata and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Corrales, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMarch 7, 2024, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nMay 13, 2025, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Edward W. \nLoughran denied Applicant national security eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDiscussion \nThe SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling about $36,000. The Judge found favorably \nfor Applicant on seven of the alleged debts and adversely on five. In her appeal brief, Applicant \ndoes not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, she contends that the Judge \nerred in his mitigation analysis. Through Counsel, Applicant argues that the Judge did not give \nappropriate weight to \u201ca series of extraordinary and compounding hardships,\u201d which included the loss of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher job,thefinancialdependency of her family members,hermother\u2019s deathduetoCOVID-19, \u201cburdensome \nexpenses in attempting to extricate herself from a timeshare contract,\u201d and the requirement that she pay \n$85,000 in restitution stemming from \u201ca prior legal matter.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all the evidence in the record. Indeed, our review of the decision confirms that the \nJudge explicitly considered each factor to which Applicant\u2019s Counsel alludes. For example, the \nJudge highlighted that the restitution payment of $85,000 for \u201ca prior legal matter\u201d was actually \nfor non-alleged financial crimes; he noted that \u201c[i]t is difficult to imagine that Applicant would \nhave been in the same dire straits if she had access to that money.\u201d Decision at 8. Moreover, the \nJudge characterized Applicant\u2019s purchase of the timeshare in June 2024\u2014after receiving and \nresponding to the SOR\u2014as a \u201cbad decision\u201d that resulted in additional and unnecessary \nexpenses. Id. at 9. In summary, the Judge considered all of the factors to which Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel alludes, but he weighed them differently. Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence is insufficient to establish the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.132.3. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The record reflects \nthat the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be \ngranted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Dept. of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision in ISCR Case No. 24-00198 is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \nSigned: Jennifer I.
