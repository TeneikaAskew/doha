On August 24, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 20, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were in error; whether the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence; whether the Judge\n\nmis-weighed the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the decision of\nthe Judge.\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to all of the allegations under Guideline F.\nHowever, he found against him for certain of the allegations under Guideline E.  He made the\nfollowing pertinent findings: Applicant is an engineer specialist working for a Defense contractor.\nFrom 1999 until 2004 Applicant worked for a public utility company.  He was laid off from work\nin 2004 and was out of work for a year.  He returned to work for the company in 2005 and in 2007\nbegan his current employment.\nIn completing his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant answered no to four\nquestions: (1) whether Applicant had ever had any property repossessed; (2) whether Applicant had\never had a lien placed against his property due to failure to pay taxes or other debts; (3) whether,\nwithin the previous seven years, Applicant had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts; and (4)\nwhether Applicant were currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  \nThese negative answers were untrue.  In fact, Applicant and his son had had a truck\nrepossessed due to non-payment; the IRS had taken a lien against Applicant\u2019s property due to non-\npayment of tax; and this same IRS debt had been delinquent over 180 days and over 90 days for\npurposes of the SCA questions at issue.  \nThe Judge further found that Applicant\u2019s answers to these four questions were deliberate.\nHe stated that the questions themselves were clear and that, under the circumstances of the case,\nApplicant\u2019s claims of good-faith mistake and/or confusion were not credible.\nApplicant enjoys a good reputation for his trustworthiness, honesty, dependability, and for\nthe quality of his job performance.  He received excellent evaluations by his employer for the 2009\nrating period.  \nFactual Sufficiency \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings.  He claims, for example, that\nthe Judge erred in his finding that the omissions on the SCA were deliberate.  He claims that the\nJudge erred by mis-identifying which of his sons had been a co-lessee with him on the repossessed\ntruck; by finding that Applicant had received a degree from college; and by finding that Applicant\nhad withdrawn $50,000 from his 401k plan.  Applicant also contends that the Judge committed other\nfactual errors, including mis-identifying his daughters as having come from his current marriage and\nunder-stating the number of years Applicant had worked for the public utility company.  \nWe review the Judge\u2019s findings of facts to determine if they are supported by substantial\nevidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  We note\nthe Judge\u2019s finding about the clarity of the questions involved.  We also note record evidence that\nApplicant attended a university for nearly two years, thereby demonstrating an educational level that\nwould render less likely claims not to have understood the questions.  In light of the record, the\n\n1The Judge\u2019s finding about the length of time Applicant worked for the utility company is supported by\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1, Applicant\u2019s SCA, at 13.  The finding about Applicant\u2019s withdrawal of $50,000 from his\n401k is supported by Applicant\u2019s testimony at Tr. 51.  The Judge\u2019s finding about Applicant\u2019s having received a college\ndegree is error.  GE 1 at 10.  The finding concerning the son with whom Applicant co-leased the truck appears to be\nerror.  Tr. at 86.  The record evidence is not clear concerning the finding about Applicant\u2019s daughters. \n \nJudge\u2019s findings about the deliberate nature of Applicant\u2019s omissions are sustainable.  Regarding\nthe remaining challenged findings, even if they contain errors, they are not such as would have\naffected the outcome of the case.1  See ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009).\nTherefore, the are harmless.  The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable. \nRemaining Issues   \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, for example his\nexcellent work performance and his good financial record prior to his lay-off from work.  However,\na Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-\n05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010).  In this case, the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the\nGuideline F concerns.  His adverse findings pertain to the false answers on Applicant\u2019s SCA, alleged\nunder Guideline E.  Under the facts of this case, evidence of prior good financial management is not\nrelevant to security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s false answers.  \nAdditionally, the Judge made specific findings about Applicant\u2019s job performance and good\nreputation.  Moreover, the record supports a conclusion that the Judge complied with the\nrequirements of Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(a) in arriving at his decision.  Applicant\u2019s presentation\non appeal is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record\nevidence.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not properly weigh the record evidence, relying too\nmuch on Applicant\u2019s years of unemployment.  Again, however, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is not\nsufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009).\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs). \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 14, 2009, and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2010, and was scheduled for\nhearing on April 12, 2010.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of six exhibits (GE); Applicant relied on two witnesses\nJuly 20, 2010\n\n2\n(including himself) and six exhibits (AE). The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 21,\n2010. \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\npayment agreement documentation and documented payment of his debts covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.h.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to\nsupplement the record.  Within the time permitted, Applicant provided copies of his cover\nletter, an IRS letter confirming his payment agreement with the Service, his son\u2019s social\nsecurity card to document his son\u2019s social security number (different from his own), his\nson\u2019s student loan statement and last correspondence regarding his student loan, a\nstatement from his medical provider documenting his payment of the debt covered by\nsubparagraph 1.h, and an updated credit report that shows the debts covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.h to bear zero balances.  Applicant\u2019s exhibits are admitted as\nAEs G through L.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated 15 delinquent\ndebts exceeding $28,000; (b) incurred a judgment in October 2006, in the amount of\n$20,000; and (c) entered into a repayment agreement with a debt consolidation firm in\nSeptember 2007.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified the security clearance\napplication (e-QIP) he completed in April 2008 by omitting his (a) repossessed vehicle,\n(b) his IRS lien, and (c) his $20,000 student loan judgment.  He is also alleged to have\ndeliberately failed to disclose his consolidation repayment agreement with F services in\nhis June 2008 interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM).\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of  the allegations pertaining\nto his finances, but denied others.  He claimed the listed adverse student loan judgment\nbelonged to his son, not himself. He denied other allegations (including all of the medical\nclaims) because they were erroneously attributed to him. He claimed to have a number\nof the medical claims (subparagraphs 1.j through 1.o) removed from his credit report.\nApplicant admitted to some of his omissions (his car repossession, his IRS lien, and his\ndebts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively), but denied the allegation of\nomitting his son\u2019s judgment.  He never admitted any deliberate e-QIP omissions, and\ndenied any intent to omit his consolidation repayment agreement in his OPM interview.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 56-year-old engineer specialist  for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n3\nApplicant married his wife in August 1977.  GE 1.  They have six sons and two\ndaughters from their marriage, who range in ages from 33 to 16.  See GE 1.\nApplicant was born and raised in Belize. He immigrated to the United States\n(U.S.) and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005.  See GEs 1 and 5).  He retains his\nBelize citizenship and is a dual citizen of the U.S and Belize.  Applicant attended college\nfor two years between July 1996 and December 1998 and earned a degree. \nBetween January 1999 and February 2004, Applicant worked for a public utility\ncompany in an engineering capacity.  GE 1.  He was laid off in February 2004 and was\nout of work for over a year. Tr. 39, 44-45.  He worked in a full-time capacity as an\nengineer between February 2005 and December 2006 before returning to the same\nutility company he previously worked for in 2004.  GE 1.  Between January 2007 and the\npresent, he has been employed as an engineering specialist for this utility company.\nSee GE 1.  \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nWhen Applicant was laid off from his full time job in 2004, it was his first layoff\nsince 1982.  Tr. 44-45, 50.  His oldest son was laid off about the same time. Tr. 45, 49-\n50.  Applicant and his son were unemployed for over a year between 2004 and 2005.\nTr. 51.  His wife left school to go to work to provide additional financial support for the\nfamily. Applicant withdrew $50,000 from his 401(k) to cover his bills. Tr. 51. This resulted\nin his owing over $10,000 in taxes and penalties.  See GE 4.  \nApplicant offered the IRS $3,800 to settle his tax debt with the IRS and was\ndeclined. Tr. 83-85  Following his unsuccessful efforts to work out a compromise with the\nIRS, the Service filed a tax lien in February 2008 in the amount of $16,332 to cover back\ntaxes owed the IRS for the tax year of 2008.  See GEs. 2 and 6.  Applicant has since\nworked out an installment payment plan with the IRS. Under the terms of his February\n2010 plan with the Service, Applicant is required to make monthly payments of $183,\nbeginning April 2010, and to continue with the payments until the entire tax debt is\nsatisfied. See AEs  C and H; Tr. 84-85. \nBesides his IRS debt, Applicant accrued a deficiency debt from an old truck lease.\nIn 2004, Applicant co-signed for his son\u2019s lease of a used truck. Tr. 106.  See GE 4.  His\nson was involved in an accident with the truck in December 2007. Tr. 75. After the\naccident, his son received medical treatment for severe brain trauma from which he has\nnot fully recovered. Tr. 41-42. Unable to work, his son was laid off from his job.\nApplicant remains jointly and severally responsible for the truck lease obligations.\nIn December 2004, both Applicant and his son were unemployed and behind in\ntheir truck lease payments. Efforts to stretch out the payments on the truck were\nunsuccessful, and the truck was repossessed from a local repair shop in January 2005.\nSee GE 4; Tr. 88-89.  After allowing for credits for the sale of the truck, Applicant and his\nson were billed for a $7,642 deficiency.  With accrued interest on the deficiency, the debt\nincreased to $8,597. Applicant has since entered into a payment plan with the truck\n\n4\nlease assignee (creditor 1.g) that requires monthly payments of $95. See AE. D; Tr. 95-\n100.  Other vehicles noted on his credit reports have been paid off.  See GEs 2 and 6;\nTr. 90-97.\nApplicant disputes most of the other debts listed in the SOR.  The largest of his\ndisputed debts is creditor 1.c\u2019s $20,651 judgment that it obtained in October 2006.  See\nGEs 2 and 6; Tr. 74-75.  Applicant claims that the judgment debtor is his son, who bears\nthe same name and obligated himself for the student loan without Applicant\u2019s assistance\nor co-signing. GE 1; Tr. 73-77.  \nTo corroborate his claim that the listed judgment concerns his son, and not\nhimself, Applicant furnished documentation of his son\u2019s social security number and loan\nrepayment schedule that bear his son\u2019s social security number. See AE I. This identified\nsocial security number differs from Applicant\u2019s social security number that is cited in his\ncredit reports. GEs. 2 and 6. Creditor 1.c\u2019s  judgment has been deleted from Applicant\u2019s\nmost recent credit reports.  AEs F and L.\n Considered together, Applicant\u2019s assurances and written proofs are sufficient to\nwarrant inferences the judgment covered by subparagraph 1.c of the SOR is erroneously\nattributable to Applicant.  See AEs J through L.\nApplicant\u2019s disputed medical debts are covered by subparagraphs 1.d and\nsubparagraphs 1.h through 1.o.  These listed debts exceed $4,000.  Applicant assures\nhe paid one of these listed debts (creditor 1.h) and disclaims any knowledge of the\nremaining ones before he received the SOR in August 2009.  Tr. 80.  He disputed these\nremaining medical debts (creditors 1.I through 1.o) in writing and received confirmations\nfrom the credit reporting agency of its intention to delete these accounts from his credit\nreport. See AEs  E and F; Tr. 103-05. These medical debts do not appear in Applicant\u2019s\nmost recent credit reports. See AEs F and L. Applicant\u2019s explanations are sufficient to\naccept his claims that these medical debts do not belong to him.\nApplicant also disputed some of his smaller debts that he claimed to have either\npaid or doesn\u2019t recognize: 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f.  See AE F; Tr.  69-72.  He characterized\nthese small bills on his credit reports as billing errors.  Tr. 69-72.\nIn September 2007, Applicant entered into a consolidated repayment agreement\nwith F Services to repay his delinquent debts. See GE 5. Under the terms of his\nagreement, Applicant pays F Services $435 a month for disbursements to his identified\ncreditors and expects to complete the payments covered by his F Services agreement\nwithin 18 months. Tr. 105. These creditors are identified in Applicant\u2019s supplied\ndisbursement summary (see AE 5) and are reflected in current status in his most recent\ncredit reports.  See AEs F and L. \nOmissions\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in April 2008, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all of the\nquestions covered by sections 27 and 28 of the questionnaire.  See GE 1.  In  answering\n\n5\n\u201cno\u201d to the questions, he omitted the repossession of the vehicle he co-signed for to\nfacilitate his son\u2019s lease, the federal tax lien that the IRS filed against Applicant\u2019s\nproperty in February 2008, his son\u2019s state judgment, and his debts over 180 delinquent\nwithin the previous seven years, and currently 90 days delinquent, respectively. \nApplicant admitted each of his omissions, but denied any intention to mislead the\nGovernment. He attributed his truck repossession omission to confusion and oversight.\nTr. 106-07  He assured he had not received the notice from the lender confirming the\nrepossession and the deficiency balance and did not know whether there was any\ndeficiency from the public sale of the vehicle. Tr. 105-06. It is his understanding that the\nrepossession and deficiency notice went to his son, who co-signed for the truck lease.   \nAddressing his omission of the state judgment owned by creditor 1.c, he claimed\nthe judgment involved his son and not himself. He has never seen a copy of this\njudgment and does not believe he ever co-signed for his son\u2019s student loan with the\nstate, or was ever named in the creditor\u2019s complaint or judgment Tr. 107-09. \nApplicant attributed his omission of his IRS tax lien in his April 2008 e-QIP to his\noverlooking it and perhaps confusing it with a lien belonging to his son.  Tr. 106-07. He\nattributed his omissions of his debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent to his belief at the\ntime that he \u201cwas pretty current on everything.\u201d  Tr. 111. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for his omissions of his medical and other smaller\ndelinquent debts in the e-QIP he executed are plausible and credible, and they are\naccepted.  He disputed most of the listed medical debts (subparagraphs 1.I through 1.o)\nin the SOR.  He is equally persuasive about the real parties to the state judgment that\ninvolved his son, and not himself. Applicant is less convincing, though, about his claimed\noversight of the IRS lien, and the underlying tax debt, that was filed just two months\nbefore he completed his e-QIP.  Less credible, too, are his explanations for his failure to\nacknowledge the repossession of the leased truck he co-signed for his son when\nanswering question 27 of his e-QIP.  \nConsidering the straight-forward nature of the e-QIP questions, and Applicant\u2019s\nblanket denials of all of the information covered in questions 27 and 28, Applicant cannot\nbe credited with good-faith mistake and confusion over his negative answers to all of the\nquestions. Taking account of his overall reputation for honesty and candor, his omissions\nof son\u2019s truck repossession, his federal tax lien, and the underlying tax debt cannot be\nexcused.  \nUnfavorable inferences warrant, accordingly, that his omissions of his leased\ntruck repossession, his federal tax lien, and the underlying tax debt were made\nknowingly and wilfully. Favorable inferences are warranted only with respect to the\nomitted state judgment belonging to his son and the remainder of the debts by the SOR. \nAn OPM investigator scheduled an interview with Applicant in June 2008 to\nresolve his credit issues. See GE 5. When interviewed by the OPM investigator,\nApplicant disclosed his IRS lien, his son\u2019s truck repossession, and the status of other\n\n6\ndebts listed in his credit report. While the summary of interview makes no reference to\nany showing of investigative use of credit report information to challenge or confront\nApplicant about his repossession, liens, and debts, it provide no information to suggest\nApplicant volunteered all of the details of his tax lien, truck repossession, and the status\nof his other without assistance from the investigator. \nIn his 2008 OPM interview, Applicant failed to disclose the details of his F\nServices agreement. AE 5. Applicant recalled discussing the agreement generally in the\ninterview, but none of the details. Tr. 113-19.  And there is no specific mention of the F\nServices agreement in the summary of interview. See GE 5. Albeit, it is briefly referenced\nin the Government\u2019s 2008 credit report.  See GE 6.  Not until he was specifically asked\nabout his enrollment in his F Services debt consolidation program in interrogatories\npropounded to him in June 2009 did he acknowledge his enrollment and provide a list of\nthe identified creditors participating in the program.  See GE 5.\nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s OPM interview, his\nexplanations of his brief reference of his F Services agreement, and his later-supplied list\nof creditors in current status in the program, no adverse inferences of material omission\nare warranted. While his discussion of his F services agreement with the interviewing\nOPM agent could have certainly been more revealing and complete, there is no\nprobative evidence of an intentional omission in his explanations.  Both his agreement\nand his payment progress with the identified creditors reflect positive efforts to address\nhis creditors, and not information he might want to conceal from the Government.\nFavorable inferences warrant with respect to the allegation covered in subparagraph 2.f.\nEndorsements and evaluations\nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisors and coworkers who are familiar with\nhis engineering work. See AE A; Tr. 35-41. His division manager credited him with\ntrustworthiness, honesty, dependability, courtesy, and strong work habits in all of the\nprojects he has tasked him to complete.  AE A.  His first-line supervisor (who also serves\nas his employer\u2019s facility security officer) characterizes Applicant as an outstanding\nemployee. Tr. 36. This first-line supervisor works with Applicant on a daily basis and has\nconsulted with him from time to time on his finances.  Tr. 37, 42  \nApplicant\u2019s coworker, who wrote on his behalf, supports Applicant\u2019s clearance\napplication.  He credits Applicant with being very honest, diligent, and hardworking. AE\nA.  Applicant has received excellent performance evaluations for his 2009 rating period.\nSee AE B.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\n\n7\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.   Adjudication Guidelines (AG), AG\n\u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\n\n8\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for a\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a respected employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a\nvehicle repossession, IRS lien, and a number of delinquent debts during his extended\nperiods of recurrent unemployment.  He has been able to resolve most of his debts by\neither paying them off in full or establishing repayment arrangements with the creditors.\nOther listed debts he has successfully disputed and resolved favorably. Still, his past\nfinancial difficulties raise some security concerns.  \nBesides initial security concerns over Applicant\u2019s finances, some concerns are\nraised, too, over his e-QIP omissions and his failure to provide more details about his F\nServices agreement when subsequently interviewed by an OPM agent.\n\n9\nFinancial concerns\nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debt delinquencies (which include a large deficiency\nbalance on a repossession and an IRS tax lien) warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guideline: DC \u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s payment history to date is quite recent and modest.  He\nhas a repayment agreement with F Services that has been in place for some time.  This\nagreement covers a host of creditors who are not included in the SOR and reflect current\ndebts in his most recent credit reports.  Applicant is current with his debt consolidation\nprogram and has made good progress in maintaining these accounts in current status,\nwhile addressing his older debts. \nAddressing his listed debts, Applicant has repayment agreements in place with F\nServices, the IRS (creditor 1.f), and creditor 1.g, and has either paid or successfully\ndisputed his remaining debts (inclusive of the state judgment that rightfully names his\nson as the responsible defendant). True, he has just prepared to make his first IRS\npayment under the installment agreement he completed with the Service in February\n2010, and he has made only a few payments to the collection agency for the lender who\nrepossessed his son\u2019s vehicle  in 2005. But the agreements reflect earnest commitments\non Applicant\u2019s part to address his debts with the limited resources he has available to\nwork with his creditors. \nEvaluating all of his repayment efforts contextually, and given his burdensome\nfamily responsibilities and unemployment history (through no fault of his own), Applicant\nmay be credited with serious, good-faith efforts to resolve his debts and regain control of\nhis finances.  His progress to date in regaining control of his finances, while modest,  is\nencouraging, and a reflection of a good deal of work on his part to resolve his listed\ndelinquencies. \nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish\nconsiderable extenuating circumstances associated with his debt accumulations. As a\nresult, MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation,\nand the individual acted responsibly),\u201d has application to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s repayment efforts entitle him to mitigation credit under both MC \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d These mitigating conditions have partial application to\nApplicant\u2019s situation, given his tight financial circumstances over the past few years.\n\n10\nTo be sure, Applicant could have exerted more responsible efforts in addressing\nhis debts once the conditions (i.e., recurrent unemployment) that contributed to the\ndelinquencies had passed or eased, and his finances had improved. See ISCR Case 03-\n01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004).  Records show that he has been continuously\nemployed with his employer since January 2007. In  balance, though, he has shown\ngood-faith in addressing his debts since he returned to full-time employment with his\ncurrent employer.\nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s duties\nand access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust and\ncandor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically imposed\non government employees and contractors involved in other lines of government\nbusiness.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Failure of the\napplicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his debts when able to do so raises\nsecurity-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the applicant\u2019s demonstrated trust\nand judgment necessary to safeguard classified information.\nWhole-person assessment enables Applicant to surmount the judgment questions\nraised by his accumulation of a repossession deficiency, an IRS tax lien, and delinquent\ndebts. His positive endorsements from his supervisors and co-worker merit considerable\npraise and commendation. On balance, he has shown sufficient tangible effort in\naddressing his major repossession delinquency, tax obligations, and other accounts to\nmitigate his listed delinquent debts and credit him with restored control over his finances.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them, and\nthe earnest steps he has mounted to address his old debts, and his current ones through\ndebt consolidation, safe predictive judgments can be made about Applicant\u2019s ability to\nrepay his accrued debts and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his\nholding a security clearance. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.p. \nPersonal conduct concerns\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\ninitially raised under Guideline E as the result of his omissions of his vehicle\nrepossession, his IRS lien, and his debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent in the e-QIP\nhe completed in April 2008.  By omitting this financial information, Applicant failed to\nfurnish materially important background information about his debts that was needed for\nthe Government to properly process and evaluate his security clearance application.\nApplicant successfully demonstrated that the state judgment bearing his name rightfully\ncovered his son, and perforce belongs to the son.  As a result, this judgment did not\nneed to be reported on his e-QIP.\n\n11\nDespite some Applicant claims of confusion about the status of the leased truck\nrepossession and the tax lien covering his delinquent taxes, his omissions of the\nrepossession, tax lien, and underlying tax debt are imputed to have been knowingly and\nwilfully made by Applicant to shield important background information from the\nGovernment.  These conclusions are based on a full review of all of the evidence and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s completion of his e-QIP. Only his omission of his\nmedical and smaller debts may be properly characterized as good-faith mistakes.\nBased on the adverse inferences of deliberate omission that are drawn from\nApplicant\u2019s omissions of his IRS tax lien, truck repossession, and underlying tax debt\nfrom his April 2008 e-QIP, DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d has application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \nIn a follow-up interview with an OPM investigator two months later, Applicant\ndisclosed his vehicle repossession, the identity and circumstances of his IRS lien and\nunderlying tax debt, and his other listed debts. Whether Applicant made his disclosures\nvoluntarily or with the help of a credit report supplied by the OPM agent cannot be\ndetermined from the interview summary itself. \n When presented with evidence of an applicant\u2019s being confronted with adverse\ninformation about his finances, the Appeal Board has held that it is then too late to\nreceive mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 17(a).  See ISCR Case No. 05-10921 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApril 19, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-30369 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2006).  It is an\napplicant\u2019s affirmative burden to demonstrate he undertook prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect his omissions, and not the Government\u2019s.\nFor Applicant to be able to take full advantage of MC \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts,\u201d it was incumbent upon him to establish convincingly that\nhe promptly volunteered the omitted information about his finances.  From the developed\nrecord, Applicant has not carried his affirmative burden with probative evidence he\ncorrected his omissions promptly and voluntarily.\nApplicant does carry his burden, though, in demonstrating his omission of his F\nServices agreement from the information he disclosed in his OPM interview was not\nintentional.  Because Applicant\u2019s failure to provide more details about his F service\nagreement was non-intentional and did not entail any effort to mislead the OPM\ninvestigator, the falsification allegations covered in the SOR that pertain to this omission\nare unsubstantiated.\nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s e-QIP and OPM\nomissions, his ensuing corrections, and his hearing explanations, his explanations are in-\nsufficient to enable him to convincingly refute the deliberate falsification allegations with\nrespect to the repossession of the leased truck, his IRS lien, and the underlying IRS\n\n12\ndebt. Overall, Applicant\u2019s omission explanations are not persuasive.  And, probative\nevidence of prompt, good-faith corrections of omitted information is lacking.  Conclusions\nwarrant, accordingly, that the omission allegations against him concerning the\nrepossession, tax line, and underlying tax debt are proven and not mitigated.    \nTaking into account all of the evidence produced in this record, unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the Guideline E allegations that Applicant knowingly\nand wilfully omitted his leased vehicle repossession, his IRS lien, and his delinquent tax\ndebt over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively, from his April 2008 e-QIP.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to his alleged omitted state judgment and his\nwithholding of his F Service agreement from the OPM investigator who later interviewed\nhim.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       FOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 1.a through 1.p :\n          \nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n          AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d through 2e:           Against Applicant\nSubparas. 2.c and 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 47-year-old intelligence analyst employed by a federal contractor. In 2002, he retired from the U.S. Air Force as a master sergeant (pay grade E-7) after more than 20 years of active duty. He received a security clearance in 1980 and eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in 1989. While on active duty, he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in April 2001 (GX 7 at 4). In August 2008, Applicant\u2019s SCI access was revoked based on financial considerations (Tr. 7; GX 10). He requested a personal appearance before an administrative judge in accordance with Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, 3 Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended. Notwithstanding the administrative judge\u2019s favorable recommendation, the Air Force Personnel Security Appeals Board upheld the revocation. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed that the administrative judge\u2019s findings of fact at the personal appearance were true as of the date of the personal appearance and could be considered at this hearing without resubmission of the evidence presented at the personal appearance (Tr. 65-66).

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 9, 2007. On May \n19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 28, 2009; answered it on June 9, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nNovember 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nJune 12, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 24, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on July 27, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August \n5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 31, 2009.  \n \nOn August 25, 2009, Department Counsel withdrew the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.k and 1.o-1.s. I treated Department Counsel\u2019s action as a motion to amend the SOR \nand I granted it, with no objection by Applicant (Tr. 14-15).  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 14 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but presented no \ndocuments. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 10, 2009. \n \nJurisdiction \n \nOn my own motion, I raised the question of jurisdiction after Applicant testified he \nwas \u201cterminated\u201d when he lost his security clearance, but his employer was holding his \nposition for him if his clearance was reinstated (Tr. 72, 78). After the hearing, I \nrequested Department Counsel to produce documentation from the Joint Personnel \nAdjudication System (JPAS) supporting jurisdiction in light of ISCR Case No. 08-09776 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2009) (Hearing Exhibit I).  \n \nDepartment Counsel responded on November 4, 2009 (HX II). Attached to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s response were JPAS documents dated August 19, 2009, and \nNovember 4, 2009, reflecting that Applicant was not separated and was still being \nsponsored for a clearance by his employer, even though he is not working or being \npaid. I admitted the JPAS documents as GX 15 and 16, without objection from \nApplicant. Based on the JPAS documents and Applicant\u2019s testimony, I am satisfied that \nDOHA had jurisdiction at the time the hearing commenced and as of the date of this \ndecision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, \n1.f-1.j, 1.l-1.n, 1.t, and 1.w. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old intelligence analyst employed by a federal contractor. \nIn 2002, he retired from the U.S. Air Force as a master sergeant (pay grade E-7) after \nmore than 20 years of active duty. He received a security clearance in 1980 and \neligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in 1989. While on \nactive duty, he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in April 2001 (GX 7 at 4).  \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant\u2019s SCI access was revoked based on financial \nconsiderations (Tr. 7; GX 10). He requested a personal appearance before an \nadministrative judge in accordance with Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPersonnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended. Notwithstanding the \nadministrative judge\u2019s favorable recommendation, the Air Force Personnel Security \nAppeals Board upheld the revocation. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed that \nthe administrative judge\u2019s findings of fact at the personal appearance were true as of \nthe date of the personal appearance and could be considered at this hearing without \nresubmission of the evidence presented at the personal appearance (Tr. 65-66). The \nadministrative judge\u2019s recommended decision is included in the record as GX 10.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant was on active duty, he deployed frequently and relied on his wife \nto handle the family finances. He learned that she was not a good money manager (Tr. \n31). Their financial difficulties started around 1995, when he returned from deployment \nand found out his wife had \u201cmaxed out\u201d their credit card accounts (Tr. 55; GX 13). \nAlthough he and his wife obtained financial counseling while he was on active duty, they \ncontinued to have financial problems until his retirement (GX 13; GX 14).  \n \nAfter Applicant retired, he accepted a civilian job in a location away from his last \nduty station. His wife and daughter decided not to move with him because his daughter \nwanted to finish high school without moving and changing schools (Tr. 32). He rented \nan apartment for his wife and daughter, and he rented a town home at his new job site. \nAlthough his wife was working and receiving up to $3,500 per month from Applicant, \nshe did not always pay the bills when they were due (Tr. 32).  \n \nAfter about a year, Applicant\u2019s father passed away, and Applicant decided to \nreturn to his former location and be with his family. His wife decided she wanted a \ndivorce. She moved out of the apartment without paying the last month\u2019s rent for the \napartment and a storage unit (Tr. 33). The three judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.c were for unpaid rent. \n \nWhen the divorce was granted, Applicant was ordered to provide his wife and \ndaughter with a car. He purchased the car and sent her money for the car payments, \nbut she did not make the payments and the car was repossessed (Tr. 34-35). \n \nAfter Applicant learned the extent of his indebtedness, he contacted a debt \nmanagement company and started to make payments to resolve the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.n, 1.t, and 1.v (GX 10-4-5). The debt management agency did \nnot include the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c in its plan for Applicant (Tr. 53), \nbut he made an arrangement to pay $300 per month on the judgments (Tr. 41; GX 8 at \n6; GX 10 at 4-5). After his clearance was revoked in August 2008, he could no longer \nwork on classified contracts, and he was forced to \u201ctake a vacation\u201d without pay \nbeginning in October 2008. Without any income other than his military retirement, he \ncould not continue to make the payments. He still was not working or drawing pay as of \nthe date of the hearing (Tr. 38-39).  \n \n \nAt the personal appearance, Applicant submitted evidence that the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.n, 1.t, and 1.v were included in a negotiated payment plan \nand he was making regular payments pursuant to it (GX 10 at 4-5). At the hearing, he \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntestified he had suspended payments under the plan because he could no longer afford \nthem.  \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.o-1.s are not listed because \nthose allegations were withdrawn by Department Counsel. \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount\nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \n1.b \n1.c \nApartment and \nStorage Unit \n(judgments) \n$3,318 \nPayment plan (suspended) \nGX 8 at 6; GX 10 at 4-\n5; Tr. 41 \n1.d \nCollection \n$1,417 \nContacted creditor; \nunresolved \nGX 6 at 3; GX 9 at 3; \nTr. 41-42 \n1.e \nHealth Club \n$1,513 \nDisputed; unresolved \nGX 5 at 8; GX 8 at 6; \nTr. 44 \n1.f \nCredit card \n$518 \nPayment plan (suspended) \nGX 10 at 5 \n1.g \nCredit card \n$1,077 \nPayment plan (suspended) \nGX 10 at 5 \n1.h \nCredit card \n$1,782 \nPayment plan (suspended) \nGX 10 at 5 \n1.i \nCredit card \n$758 \nPaid \nGX 10 at 4 \n1.j \nCredit card \n$570 \nPaid \nGX 10 at 4 \n1.l \nCar \nrepossession \n$7,504 \nEx-wife\u2019s debt; attempting \nto resolve \nGX 10 at 3; Tr. 46-47 \n1.m \nCredit card \n$212 \nMaking monthly payments \nGX 8 at 9; Tr. 47 \n1.n \nCredit union \n$390 \nPayment plan (suspended) \nGX 8 at I10 \n1.t \nCar \nrepossession \n$9,988 \nPayment plan (suspended) \nGX 8 at I13;  \nGX 10 at 5 \n1.u \nCollection \n$283 \nPaid \nGX 10 at 4; Tr. 50 \n1.v \nCollection \n$1,417 \nPayment plan (suspended) \nGX 8 at I21 \n1.w \nDish TV \n$152 \nWife\u2019s debt; unresolved \nGX 5 at 8; Tr. 51-52 \n \n \nApplicant testified at the hearing that he disputed the health club debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. It arose when he moved back to his family\u2019s location and informed the club \nthat he was moving (Tr. 44). He testified he was assured by the club owner that there \nwas no problem with terminating his membership, but the debt appeared on his credit \nreport after another company took over the club (Tr. 44). He did not present any \ndocumentation of his dispute.  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel questioned the administrative judge\u2019s finding at the \npersonal appearance that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.u was paid, pointing out the \ndiscrepancy in account numbers (HX I). I have accepted the administrative judge\u2019s \nfinding that it was paid, because there are no debts to that creditor on the credit reports \ndated after the personal appearance (GX 6; GX 9). \n \n \nApplicant has exhausted the funds in his retirement account (Tr. 60), and he is \nliving very frugally. He lives in a friend\u2019s house and contributes to the household \n\n \n5 \n \n \nexpenses when he can, but he does not pay rent. His car was damaged in an accident, \nthe insurance company paid off the balance due on the car loan, and Applicant has not \nreplaced it (Tr. 59). His son dropped out of college because he and his parents could no \nlonger afford to pay for his education (Tr. 60). He is dating a woman who is \u201cvery good \nwith money,\u201d and she has been helping him prepare a budget and apply his limited \nincome to his expenses (Tr. 59-60).  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised \nwhen there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when \nthere is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, \nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d  \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems dating back to about 1995. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e) are raised by his financial history, shifting the burden to him to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are recent and frequent. However, many of his financial problems were \nthe product of frequent deployments and reassignments, maintaining two households, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand his ex-wife\u2019s financial irresponsibility. Now that he is retired from the Air Force and \ndivorced, these circumstances are not likely to recur. Until he lost his clearance in \nOctober 2008, he was gainfully employed, had obtained professional assistance with his \nfinances, and was executing a realistic plan to regain financial stability. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nApplicant encountered numerous conditions beyond his control: numerous \ndeployments and reassignments, his ex-wife\u2019s mismanagement of their finances, a \ndivorce, and loss of employment. He did not act responsibly when he first learned that \nhis then-wife was mismanaging their finances and spending money irresponsibly. After \nthe break-up of his marriage, however, he sought professional help and was well on his \nway to financial stability until he lost his clearance and his income. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nreceived financial counseling in the Air Force, but it apparently was not effective, \nbecause his problems persisted even after he retired. More recently, however, he \nengaged the services of a debt-management agency, and his financial problems were \nunder control until he lost his clearance and stopped working. At the moment, his \nproblems are not being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. \n \nApplicant had a plan in place and was carrying it out until he lost his clearance. \nHis track record as of the date of his personal appearance in August 2008 \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndemonstrated the good-faith effort required to establish AG \u00b6 20(d). He went beyond his \nlegal obligations trying to resolve the car repossession debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l, even though \nthe domestic relations judge found that the debt was solely his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. I \nam confident that he will resume execution of his plan if he regains his clearance and \ncan resuming working for his employer. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed the health club debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but he provided no \u201cdocumented \nproof\u201d of the dispute or evidence of actions to resolve it. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He held a security clearance for about \n28 years and SCI access for about 19 years before they were revoked. He also has a \nlong history of financial problems dating back to about 1995. He had finally adopted a \nrealistic plan to regain his financial health when his clearance was revoked, putting him \nin a Catch-22 situation: he needed his clearance to resolve his financial problems, but \nhe could not keep his clearance because of his financial problems.  \n \n \nApplicant was sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. He cannot work in his \nspecialty without a clearance, but the financial impact of losing his clearance is not \nrelevant. See ISCR Case No. 02-09220 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2004). However, the \nsignificant steps he took to resolve his financial problems before his clearance was \n\n \n9 \n \n \nrevoked are relevant. I am confident that, if he is able to resume his job, he will resolve \nhis remaining financial problems.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve doubtful cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to restore his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant (withdrawn) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l-1.n: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.s: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant (withdrawn) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.t-1.w: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto restore Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 8, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 15, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on June 2, 2010 with a hearing date of June 30, 2010. The \nhearing was rescheduled to accommodate a witness\u2019s availability. DOHA issued a \nsecond notice of hearing on June 29, 2010, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on August 10, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, \nwhich were admitted except as noted.1  Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit index was \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, presented three witnesses, and \noffered exhibits (AE) A-H that were admitted without any objections. Applicant\u2019s exhibit \nindex was marked as HE II. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 17, \n2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.b, 1.c (partially), 1.d, and \n1.k. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.e\u20131.n. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He is married and has one child. Since 2004, he has \nworked as an information systems engineer for a local university that also does \ngovernment contracting work. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is working on a \nmaster\u2019s degree. He has no military experience. He has held a security clearance since \n1995.2   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raised in the SOR includes: (1) being fired from a job for \nstealing money from a cash register in 1976 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) using, purchasing, and \nselling various drugs between 1979 and 1984 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c); (3) being arrested in \n1984 on a theft charge (SOR \u00b6 1.d); (4) using a prescription drug, Percocet, for non-\nprescribed use in 1997 and 2000, and while holding a security clearance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-\n1.g); (5) taking a computer chip home from work without authorization (SOR \u00b6 1.h); (6) \nmaking false statements on security clearance applications, to investigators, and in \ninterrogatories concerning his Percocet misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j, 1.l-1.n); (7) being \ndenied access to a classified program by another government agency in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k). \n \n \n \nApplicant admits to unacceptable behavior when he was younger. He wrongfully \ntook money from an employer when he was 16 years old. He paid the money back and \nwas fired for his actions. When he was in college, between 1979 and 1984, Applicant \n \n1 GE 1 and 5-6 were admitted in total. GE 2 was admitted except for pages 6-10 of the exhibit. I sustained \nan objection to those pages based upon there being no authenticating witness for these Department of \nDefense reports as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. GE 3 was admitted except for pages 20-23 of the \nexhibit. I sustained an objection to those pages based upon there being no authenticating witness for \nthese Department of Defense reports as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. GE 4 was not admitted for the \nsame reason stated above. \n \n2 Tr. at 32-33; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nengaged in extensive drug involvement including using and purchasing drugs such as \nmarijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, mushrooms, Quaaludes, opium, and hashish. \nApplicant maintained that while he engaged in accommodation transfers to his friends \nfor money, he did not engage in the sale of drugs for profit. He was also drinking heavily \nthen. He was 19 to 23 years old when he engaged in this behavior. His school work also \nsuffered because of his drug and alcohol activities. In 1984, he was arrested and \ncharged with shop lifting. As part of his probation, he was required to attend Alcohol \nAnonymous (AA) meetings. He completed his probation, but realized that AA was \nsomething he needed to help get his life under control. It was in either late 1983 or early \n1984 that Applicant stopped using drugs and his last drink was in February 1984. He \nalso began regular AA attendance.3  \n \n \nIn February 1997, Applicant had surgery and was prescribed Percocet for the \npain he experienced during his recovery. He took only about half the prescribed amount \nof Percocet because, given his alcoholic background, he was concerned how taking this \ndrug might affect his sobriety. The leftover Percocet remained in his medicine cabinet. \nHe did not take any Percocet outside of the prescribed use. In October of 2000, \nApplicant fell off a ladder while working at his home. He broke two ribs from the fall and \nwas once again prescribed Percocet for the pain. He only took half of the prescribed \ndosage because he felt uncomfortable taking this medicine because of his alcoholic \nbackground and because it caused him to be nauseous. The remaining Percocet \nremained in his medicine cabinet. He only took the Percocet for the prescribed purpose \nto relieve the pain from the broken ribs he suffered.4 \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant sought eligibility to access sensitive compartmented \ninformation (SCI) through another government agency. He was interviewed during this \nprocess. Those interviews, in a summarized fashion, formed the basis for the denial of \nApplicant\u2019s request for SCI access on October 1, 2003. The interview characterized \nApplicant as misusing the Percocet on several occasions outside of the prescribed use \nbecause Applicant used the term \u201cmake himself feel good\u201d when he described using the \nPercocet. Applicant admitted he may have used a poor choice of words, but what he \nmeant was he used the Percocet for the prescribed purpose to make him feel better.5  \n \n \nThe Government did not offer any written statements by the Applicant concerning \nthis interview. Additionally, the Government agent conducting the interview did not \ntestify at hearing. Alternatively, Applicant did testify at the hearing about his Percocet \nuse and was subject to cross-examination by Department Counsel. I found his \ntestimony, that he only used Percocet as prescribed, credible.   \n \n \n3 Tr. at 36-44. \n \n4 GE 5; Tr. at 66-69. \n \n5 GE 2; Tr. at 39-42. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIn April 2000, Applicant took home a company computer chip so he could use it \non his personal computer. The chip had been discarded by his company and was going \nto be donated to charity. There was no classified information on the chip. Once \nApplicant got the chip home, he started thinking about whether he was authorized to \ntake the chip home. With this thought in mind, he returned the chip and talked to his \ncomputer security manager about what the policy was for this sort of thing. The security \nperson was not sure what the policy was, but he did not think Applicant had done \nanything wrong. The chip had minimal intrinsic value. Applicant decided to leave the \nchip in a surplus bin at work and never took it home again. No disciplinary action \nresulted against him by his company for taking the chip.6  \n \n \nFour coworkers/supervisors submitted character letters for the Applicant. \nAdditionally, two witnesses testified to Applicant\u2019s good character. Applicant is held in \nhigh regard for his professional work and his reputation for honesty, trustworthiness, \nand dependability. Applicant also presented the testimony and written report of a \npsychologist who interviewed him for the purpose of this action. I found minimal value to \nthis information.7  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \n \n6 GE 5, Tr. at 74-78, 128. \n \n7 AE C-F; Tr. at 130-149, 153-166. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group.  \nApplicant\u2019s admitted drug involvement from 1979 to 1984 and his 1976, 1984, \nand 2000 thefts and unauthorized taking of a computer chip reflect personal conduct \nthat creates a vulnerability to his personal standing. AG \u00b6 16(e) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a. - \n1.d and 1.h. \nI found Applicant\u2019s denial of improper use of Percocet credible. Additionally, the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence to prove unauthorized use was based upon a report that \nsummarized an interview by an agent who did not testify and was not subject to cross-\nexamination. I gave this evidence less weight than Applicant\u2019s testimony. Therefore, the \nevidence does not support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \u2013 1.g and AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e) does \nnot apply. \nAll the false statement allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n) are \npremised on Applicant misusing Percocet. Since I concluded that Applicant did not \nmisuse Percocet, there is no factual basis to support these allegations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n(b) do not apply. Finally, the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is the same conduct as \nalleged in the remaining allegations. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse ended 26 years ago. Since then he has remained sober \nthrough the support of AA. Likewise, the two theft incidents occurred over 25 years ago \nwhen Applicant was young and immature. The computer chip incident was minor in \nnature, Applicant self-reported his actions, and no consequences resulted. Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are not in doubt. I am convinced that \nthese types of action will not recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), and (e) all apply.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age when \nhe engaged in his drug abuse and thefts, and the passage of time since the acts. \nAdditionally, I considered his current work environment and the strong recommendation \nhe received from a coworker regarding Applicant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant met his burden and provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant used marijuana, at times daily, from June 1997 to at least August 2008.\nHe continued to smoke and purchase the illegal drug despite being arrested on three\noccasions for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He denies any intent to\nuse marijuana in the future, but the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that his\nillegal drug use is behind him. Clearance denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that provided the\nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to\nan administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nJuly 29, 2010\n\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was found guilty of the February 2005 paraphernalia charge. The\n1\ncourt record indicates that he was convicted of the marijuana possession charge, and the paraphernalia\npossession charge was not prosecuted. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was charged with an alcohol-related offense.\n2\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an undated Answer, which was received by DOHA on June\n16, 2009. He requested a decision without a hearing. On July 20, 2009, the Government\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7).\nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within\n30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on November 2, 2009. DOHA received\nno response from Applicant by December 2, 2009, the due date, and on February 2,\n2010, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. Based upon a review\nof the Government\u2019s FORM, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, that Applicant used\nmarijuana from about June 1997 to at least August 2008 (SOR 1.a), and that he had\npurchased marijuana (SOR 1.b). Under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Applicant is\nalleged to have been arrested on marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia\npossession charges in February 2005 (SOR 2.a), July 2004 (SOR 2.b), and June 2003\n(SOR 2.c), and found guilty of the 2005 drug paraphernalia possession and 2003\nmarijuana possession charges.  Applicant admits the allegations. After considering the\n1\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old data quality engineering analyst, who has worked for a\ndefense contractor since March 2008. He has a bachelor of science degree in\nmathematics and seeks his first security clearance. (Item 4.)\nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, at times daily, from June 1997\nto at least August 2008. He began using marijuana at age 14 because \u201ceveryone\u201d at his\nschool was using it. Applicant smoked the illegal drug with friends, to include in his\nhome. Applicant purchased marijuana on occasion. Other times, he obtained the drug\nfrom his friends at no cost to him. He continued to smoke the drug while in college from\nAugust 2001 to August 2007, despite three arrests for possession of marijuana and\ndrug paraphernalia. He stopped using marijuana at times because he was arrested,\nonly to resume smoking the drug. (Items 4, 5.)\nIn early June 2003, Applicant was stopped for driving under the influence.  The\n2\npolice found less than one gram of marijuana in a bowl in his vehicle, and Applicant was\narrested and charged with possession of marijuana and with possession of drug\n\n3\nparaphernalia. (Items 4, 6.) In August 2003, he pleaded guilty to marijuana possession.\nHe was awarded unsupervised probation before judgment; fines and costs totaling\n$100; and 30 days in jail, with 29 days suspended and credit for one day served. The\nparaphernalia possession charge was dismissed. (Item 6.) Applicant completed his\nprobation on August 4, 2004. (Items 4, 5, 6.) Although not reflected in the district court\nrecords, Applicant apparently also had to complete two days of community service.\n(Item 5.) \nIn early July 2004, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and\npossession of drug paraphernalia after some marijuana was found in his car. The\ncharges were not prosecuted after the arresting officer failed to appear in court in\nNovember 2004. (Item 4, 5, 6.) \nIn early February 2005, while in college visiting a friend, Applicant was arrested\nalong with his friend by campus police. Applicant was charged with possession of drug\nparaphernalia and with possession of marijuana. In late April 2005, he was found guilty\nof marijuana possession and sentenced to probation until October 7, 2006; to 15 days in\njail (suspended); and to $55 in costs (suspended). The drug paraphernalia charge was\nnot prosecuted. (Items 4, 5, 6, 7.) The university placed him on probationary status,\nbarred him from student housing for three years, and required him to undergo drug\ntesting and to complete 100 hours of community service. Applicant completed the terms\nof his sentence in 2006. (Item 5.)\nIn March 2008, Applicant started his professional career with his current\nemployer. (Item 4.)  Applicant continued to smoke marijuana until at least August 2008.\n(Items 4, 5.) On September 16, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance for his\ndefense contractor employment. He indicated on his application that he used marijuana\n\u201ccountless\u201d times from about June 1997 to August 2008. (Item 4.) During an October 16,\n2008, interview with an authorized investigator for the Government, Applicant admitted\nthat he had used marijuana in the past between June 1996 and August 2008, at times\ndaily. Applicant denied any intent to use marijuana in the future, or that he had a\nproblem with marijuana. He discussed his three arrests on drug charges, and admitted\nthat small amounts of marijuana had been found in his car and some paraphernalia had\nbeen found in his car in the 2003 and 2004 incidents. Concerning the 2005 arrest,\nApplicant indicated that he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, and to possession\nof drug paraphernalia. (Item 5.) But court records indicate that he was found guilty of\nmarijuana possession after he had pleaded not guilty. (Item 6.)\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in January 2009, and in response to the\nSOR in June 2009, Applicant had an opportunity to update the record concerning his\ndrug involvement and any changes in his lifestyle to ensure against a relapse. (Item 3,\n5.) He provided no information.\nAs of September 2008, Applicant was involved in a committed relationship with\nhis girlfriend, who lived with him. They shared their apartment with a male roommate.\n(Item 4.) The available record is silent as to whether or not Applicant\u2019s girlfriend has\n\n4\never used any illegal drugs, or whether she knows about his marijuana use. Nor is there\nany information about the roommate\u2019s involvement, if any, with illegal drugs or whether\nApplicant has changed his associates or activities to ensure a drug-free lifestyle.\nApplicant\u2019s mother apparently knows something about his illegal drug use or his arrests\nor both (Item 5), although the extent of her knowledge is unclear.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\n\n5\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nApplicant smoked marijuana in various quantities between June 1997 and August\n2008. While there were periods of abstention, especially after his arrests, he abused the\ndrug as frequently as daily at other times. Applicant also purchased the drug, and he\nwas arrested on three occasions after he was caught with the drug or drug\nparaphernalia or both. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug\npossession, cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or\npossession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d apply.\nAlthough there is no evidence that Applicant has used any illegal drug since\nAugust 2008, AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably\napply to marijuana abuse that occurred over ten years and was as frequent as daily.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s admission to having smoked marijuana \u201ccountless\u201d times, I\naccept as credible his assertions in October 2008 that he had not smoked marijuana\nsince sometime in August 2008, and that he did not intend any future use. But it is\nunclear whether he has managed to sustain his commitment to abstinence, or whether\nhe has avoided the friends with whom he had smoked marijuana, or situations\npotentially conducive to drug use. Applicant provided no new detail about his drug\ninvolvement or efforts to abstain when he answered DOHA interrogatories in January\n2009, or the SOR in June 2009. He filed no response to the FORM. AG \u00b6 26(b) requires\nan applicant to demonstrate his or her commitment to maintain a drug-free lifestyle.\nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any illegal drugs in the future\u201d\ncan be shown by:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\n\n6\nThe information of record falls considerably short of establishing \u201ca demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse any drugs in the future\u201d under AG \u00b6 26(b). There is no evidence that\nApplicant has completed a drug treatment program, so AG \u00b6 26(d) is not pertinent. As of\nOctober 2008, he did not believe that he had a problem with marijuana.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe security concern about criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and\npossession of drug paraphernalia in June 2003, July 2004, and February 2005. He\nadmits that marijuana and drug paraphernalia were in his vehicle in June 2003 and July\n2004, so AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d applies, despite the\ncourt\u2019s decision to award him probation before judgment for the 2003 marijuana\npossession charge, and the state\u2019s decision not to prosecute the paraphernalia\npossession charge in 2003 and marijuana possession and paraphernalia possession\ncharges in 2004. AG \u00b6 31(c) also applies because of the guilty finding on the February\n2005 marijuana possession charge. Furthermore, three illegal drug offenses within three\nyears implicate AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nAlthough Applicant has not been arrested for marijuana possession since\nFebruary 2005, he continued to smoke the drug, and therefore had physical custody of\nthe illegal drug on the occasions of usage, until at least August 2008. AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply to drug\ninvolvement that was obviously a significant part of Applicant\u2019s socialization or\nrecreational activities for over ten years. There is no indication that Applicant was\npressured into using and possessing marijuana, so AG \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthe person was\npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present\nin the person\u2019s life,\u201d is not pertinent. AG \u00b6 32(c), \u201cevidence that the person did not\ncommit the offense,\u201d applies, if at all, to the 2005 possession of drug paraphernalia. The\ndetails of his arrest, as disclosed during his subject interview of October 2008, do not\ninclude an admission to possession of any paraphernalia, apart from a statement that\nhe pleaded guilty to the charge. The court records indicate that he pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d\nto the marijuana possession charge. The drug paraphernalia charge was not\nprosecuted after an \u201cother plea\u201d was entered for that offense.\nApplicant demonstrated some reform around September 2008 when he resolved\nto stop using marijuana out of concern for his employment. But in the absence of\nevidence proving Applicant has successfully put his illegal drug abuse behind him, and\n\nThe adjudicative process factors identified in AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows:\n3\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n7\nthat  his present activities, associates, and circumstances are consistent with a drug-\nfree lifestyle, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG \u00b6 2(a).  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\n3\na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nMarijuana played a significant part in Applicant\u2019s recreational or social activities\nfor over ten years. He smoked the drug in his home, and with his friends. He likely also\nsmoked the drug in his vehicle at least twice. The police found marijuana and\nparaphernalia in his car on two occasions, including in 2003 when he was stopped for\ndriving under the influence. He continued his marijuana involvement even after he was\nfound guilty in court and sanctioned by the university for his drug use in 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s blatant disregard for the laws prohibiting the use of marijuana is inconsistent\nwith the judgment and reliability that must be demanded of those persons granted\naccess to classified information. His candor about his drug involvement is a factor in his\nfavor, but based on the evidence before me, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He denied the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. Applicant is 40 years old. He was an inactive reservist in the Army from February 1987 until January 1988 when he received an honorable discharge. He married his first wife in January 1993 and divorced in June 2000. They have three children, ages 9, 13 and 16 years old. He married his second wife in December 2007. They have a two-year- old child. Since July 2008, he has worked as a scientific programmer for a defense contractor. Prior to this position, he was consistently employed over the last ten years, except for a month in 2000. (Item 4.) In April 2009, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories regarding his delinquent debts. He attributed his financial problems to his separation and divorce in 2000, subsequent child support proceedings, a month of unemployment in 2000, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in which he lost his personal property.

On August 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

(Item  4.) \n \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories regarding his \ndelinquent debts. He attributed his financial problems to his separation and divorce in \n2000, subsequent child support proceedings, a month of unemployment in 2000, and \nHurricane Katrina in 2005 in which he lost his personal property. He also submitted his \nfamily budget that recorded a net annual income of $63,150 (after deducting his child \nsupport payments), which is approximately a monthly income of $5,262.

(Item 6 at 7.) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated July 25, 2008 and June 15, 2009, \nthe SOR alleged seven delinquent debts, totaling $30,330, which became delinquent \nbetween 2001 and 2009. (Items 5, 9.) The status of each debt is as follows: \n \n1. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $11,643 is a federal tax lien that was filed \non May 14, 2009, for taxes due for 2001. Applicant admitted that he owed the \ntaxes and indicated that he had made payment arrangements and intended to \npay the debt. (Item 6 at 6.) He did not submit any evidence that he is making \npayments on the lien. It remains unresolved.  \n \n2. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $207 is owed to a communications \ncompany. It was reported to the credit bureau in June 2009. (Item 9.) \nApplicant denied owing this debt, but did not present any evidence that he \ndisputed it or other evidence to support his assertion. The debt is unresolved.  \n \n3. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $106 is a medical bill that was reported in \nJune 2009. (Item 9.) Applicant denied owing this debt, but did not present any \nevidence that he disputed it or other evidence to support his assertion. The \ndebt is unresolved. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n4. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $186 is a debt owed to a credit collection \ncompany. In his Answer, Applicant denied the debt. In his April 2009 \nInterrogatories, he stated that he was unaware of the debt, but would pay it. \n(Item 6 at 4.) He did not present any evidence that he disputed it or to support \nhis assertion that it was not his debt. It is unresolved.   \n \n5. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $291 is a medical debt. Applicant admitted \nthe debt and stated in the April 2009 Interrogatories that he would pay it.  \n(Item 6 at 4.) It remains unresolved.  \n \n6. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $16,945 is a car loan that was charged off \nin July 2002, indicating that Applicant defaulted before that date. He admitted \nthe debt and indicated in his April 2009 Interrogatories that he intended to \nmake arrangements to pay. (Item 6 at 5.) It is unresolved. \n \n7. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $952 is owed to a creditor for a debt that \nbecame delinquent in 2002. In his April 2009 Interrogatories, he stated he \nwas unaware of it, but indicated that he would pay it. (Item 6 at 5.) It is \nunresolved.   \n \n \nOther than his statements, Applicant submitted no documentation that he has \ntaken any steps to resolve his debts. He presented no character references or other \nevidence to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to \nevaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his \ncase decided without a hearing. \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe two potentially disqualifying conditions raised by Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ and AG & \n19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ Based on two CBRs and his \nstatements, Applicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing \nin 2001 and which he has not addressed. The evidence is sufficient to raise said \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of those security concerns. The guideline \nincludes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated \nwhere Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s seven financial \ndelinquencies arose in 2001 and remain unresolved to date. Because the problems are \nongoing and not isolated, there is a likelihood that that they will continue in the future \nand cast doubt about his current judgment. Hence, this condition does not apply.   \n \nAG & 20(b) states that it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant \nstated that some of his financial problems arose after he divorced in 2000 and \nexperienced personal losses in 2005 as a result of a hurricane. However, he did not \noffer any evidence that he attempted to act responsibly while the debts were accruing or \nafter they accrued. This mitigating condition marginally applies.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not present any evidence that \nhe received credit counseling and/or that his financial problems are under control, as \nrequired under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nthat Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@ He did not provide evidence that he paid, attempted to pay, or has a \nrepayment plan for any debt, including the smaller debts. AG & 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he legitimately disputed any of the debts \nin SOR. Said evidence is necessary to trigger mitigation under AG & 20(e), which \napplies when \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue.\u201d  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 40 years old, married to \nhis second wife, and has three children from a previous marriage for whom he pays \nchild support. He has successfully worked for his employer since July 2008. He served \nin the military for a year. In April 2009, the Government put him on notice about the \nsecurity concerns related to his delinquent debt. Despite stating that he would resolve \nhis debts in April 2009, and subsequently receiving the SOR in August 2009, he has not \ntaken any action to address his financial obligations. His persistent inaction, in view of a \nbudget that could accommodate repayment, is troubling. It demonstrates a lack of good \njudgment and increases the likelihood that similar financial concerns will recur. The \nrecord contains insufficient other evidence about his character, trustworthiness, or \nreliability to mitigate these concerns. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance at this time. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate all of the concerns arising under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the f national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On April 27, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 15, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 16, 2009. I received the case assignment on June 22, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 8, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n6, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received\n\n2\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Applicant\nExhibits A through K, which were received without objection. Applicant requested that\nthe record remain open for a period of time to allow for the receipt of additional\ndocumentation. Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibit L on August 10, 2009, which was\nalso received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing, and the\nrecord closed, on August 17, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 49, single, and has a post-graduate degree. She is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment\nin the defense industry. Applicant admits both allegations in the SOR. Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. She also provided additional\ninformation to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)  \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she\nhas acted in a way that shows a preference for another country over the United States. \nApplicant was born in Germany (then West Germany) in 1959.  She left Germany\nin 1985 to continue her education in Canada. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at Section 9;\nTranscript at 24.)  Applicant moved to the United States in 1993.  She became a\nnaturalized American citizen in April 2006. (Government Exhibit 1, Section 8.)  She has\nworked for her current employer since 2007. (Government Exhibit 1, Section 11;\nApplicant Exhibit C; Transcript at 26.) Applicant\u2019s net worth in the United States is about\n$310,000. She has no financial interests in Germany. (Applicant Exhibit D; Transcript at\n26-27.)\nApplicant has had a German passport during the entire time she has been an\nAmerican citizen. In August 2001, before she became an American citizen, she\nrenewed this passport as required by US immigration law. (Government Exhibit 2.)\nApplicant has made two trips to Germany since she became an American citizen, in\n2007 and 2009. She was unclear which passport she used to travel to Germany in\n2009, stating, \u201cI used whatever is the slower line, the shorter line for it.\u201d Neither passport\nshowed transit stamps from this trip. (Government Exhibit 2; Transcript at 37-38.)\nApplicant testified that she wishes to retain her German passport in order to have a\nGerman language ID when travelling to Germany to visit her elderly parents. (Transcript\nat 27-28.) Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant surrendered her German passport to\nher security officer for safe-keeping. (Applicant Exhibit L.) \nApplicant is still a dual citizen of Germany and the United States. In fact, she\npetitioned the German government in 2000 to be allowed to retain her German\ncitizenship after she completed her naturalization process in the United States in 2006.\n\n3\nThis permission was granted. (Transcript at 25.) This was required because Applicant\u2019s\nGerman citizenship would have been automatically revoked upon her acquiring\nAmerican citizenship. (Applicant Exhibit A.) Applicant stated repeatedly and\nemphatically that she is not willing to take any steps to renounce her German\ncitizenship while her parents are still alive. (Transcript at 30-35.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted evidence showing that she has consistently followed the\nrules concerning reporting foreign travel and foreign contacts to her security office.\n(Applicant Exhibits J and K.)\nApplicant submitted letters and other documents.  They show that she is a highly\nrespected expert in her field, and that she has provided valuable services to the defense\nefforts of the United States.  People who have worked with her believe that she is an\nhonest person and recommend her for a security clearance.  (Applicant Exhibits E, H,\nand I.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or\nmitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\napplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant is a dual citizen of Germany and the United States, and that she\nhas a valid German passport (Guideline C).\n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nThe Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s concerns about her dual\ncitizenship with Germany, and her continued possession and use of her German\npassport after becoming an American citizen. The concern is stated thus under this\nGuideline, \u201cwhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\n5\nUnder any analysis of the evidence, it is obvious that Applicant would like to\nretain her German citizenship and passport if at all possible.  The undersigned well\nunderstands that the Applicant has emotional ties to her parents.  However, Applicant\ndid not even attempt to make a credible showing that she \u201cexpressed a willingness to\nrenounce dual citizenship\u201d as required by Mitigating Condition 11.(b). Instead, she\ncredibly stated that she does not intend to even contemplate such an action as long as\nher parents are alive.\nApplicant took steps to retain her German citizenship before she began the\nprocess to become an American citizen. Disqualifying Condition 10(b) states that a\nconcern is \u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen.\u201d Applicant was not an American citizen when she took the above\naction. However, the steps were taken when she was contemplating becoming an\nAmerican citizen, and approval of the request was important to her in making the\ndecision. This was because her German citizenship would have been revoked upon her\nbecoming an American citizen. I find that this condition has some application, given the\nparticular circumstances of this case. \nDisqualifying Condition 10(a)(1) applies to the facts of this case: \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include: (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1)\npossession of a current foreign passport.  (Emphasis supplied.)\nApplicant has surrendered her passport to her company security officer.\nTherefore, it has \u201cbeen destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated.\u201d  Accordingly, Mitigating Condition 11(e) applies to this case.  \nHowever, the above action is insufficient to completely mitigate the Government\u2019s\nconcerns. As stated above, Applicant made affirmative steps that allowed her to retain\nher German citizenship after becoming an American citizen. In addition, the record\nshows that Applicant was reluctant to even surrender her passport.  Her ties with\nGermany obviously still run deep. Accordingly, Guideline C is found against the\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Two of the factors have the most\nimpact on this case. First, I cannot find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nApplicant simply has not engaged in sufficient conduct which shows a preference for the\nUnited States instead of Germany. Rather, her conduct shows a clear preference for\nGermany over the United States.  \nApplicant\u2019s obvious reluctance to take the steps necessary to show a preference\nfor the United States make it impossible for me to find that there is little or no \u201cpotential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on July 29, 2008 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 5). On June 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline C \n(GX 1). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nOctober 27, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 30, 2009; answered it on July 6, 2009; and \nrequested a decision on the record without a hearing (GX 4). DOHA received his \nresponse on July 20, 2009. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written \ncase on August 5, 2009. On August 6, 2009, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s \nevidence. Applicant received the FORM on August 11, 2009, but did not respond. The \ncase was assigned to me on October 8, 2009.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old engineer employed by a federal contractor (GX 6 at 1). \nHe has worked for his current employer since March 1995. He has never held a security \nclearance.  \n \nApplicant married a U.S. citizen in June 1973 and was divorced in June 1997. He \nmarried his current spouse in September 2004. His current spouse was born in the \nRepublic of Vietnam and became a U.S. citizen in September 1974. He has three \nchildren from his first marriage and a stepson from his second marriage. All are U.S. \ncitizens. At the time he submitted his security clearance application, his stepson was a \nU.S. Army captain serving in Iraq. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Italy. His parents and brother are citizens and residents of \nItaly. He served as an officer in the Italian Air Force from October 1969 to April 1989 \n(GX 6 at 4). He attended college in the U.S. from January 1993 to March 1995 and \nobtained a degree in electrical engineering (GX 5 at 5-6). He became a U.S. citizen in \nOctober 2005 and obtained a U.S. passport in November 2005 (GX 6 at 3).  \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in September 2008, Applicant \nstated his allegiance is to both Italy and the U.S., but his ultimate allegiance is to Italy \n(GX 6 at 3). He is not willing to renounce his Italian citizenship. He has held an Italian \npassport since 1967 and renews it periodically. He uses his Italian passport for travel to \nItaly three times a year (GX 6 at 4).  \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in March 2009, Applicant stated he intended \nto renew his Italian passport because it is his only government identification while he is \nin Italy and it allows him to stay in Italy for as much time as he desires (GX 6 at 10). He \nlast renewed his Italian passport in March 2008 (GX 6 at 15). \n \n \nApplicant votes in Italian elections every five years (GX 4 at 42). He last voted in \nan Italian election in April 2008 (GX 6 at 12). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \n\n \n3\nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Italy by possessing a \ncurrent Italian passport (SOR \u00b6 1.a(1)), by renewing his Italian passport in 2008 after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a(2)), by using his Italian passport for travel \nto Italy (SOR \u00b6 1.a(3)), and by voting in Italian elections after becoming a U.S. citizen \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a(4)). It also alleges he told a security investigator that his ultimate allegiance \nis to Italy (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline C is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a \nway as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or \nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. A disqualifying condition may arise from \n\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(1)) and \u201cvoting in a foreign election\u201d (AG \u00b6 10(a)(7)).  \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 1999). \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, \neven for a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might \npose a challenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, \n2009). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of an Italian passport and his participation in \nItalian elections after becoming a U.S. citizen raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and (7), shifting the \nburden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nFour mitigating conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 11(a): \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or \nbirth in a foreign country\u201d;  \n \nAG \u00b6 11(b): \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship\u201d; \n \n\n \n5\nAG \u00b6 11(c): \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when \nthe individual was a minor\u201d; and   \n \nAG \u00b6 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  \n \nNone of the above enumerated mitigating conditions are established by the evidence in \nthis case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult with many ties to the U.S., but he also \nhas deep ties to Italy. He is unwilling to sever those ties. He was candid during his \nsecurity interview and admitted that his ultimate allegiance is to Italy.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n6\nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a(1)-1.a(4): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(SCA, GE 1) on December 8, 2006.  On September 30, 2008, Applicant was\n1\ninterviewed by an investigator of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\nconcerning drug involvement. In his interrogatory answers dated January 8, 2009,\nApplicant checked \u201cYes,\u201d that he agreed with and adopted the investigator\u2019s summary of\nthe September 30, 2008, interview, and that it could be used in evidence (GE 2). On\nApril 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug involvement (Guideline H),\nand personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order\nMarch 1, 2010\n\n2\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant furnished his answer to the SOR on June 9, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on August 31, 2009, for a hearing on September 16, 2009. The\nhearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, two exhibits (GE I and GE 2) were\nadmitted in evidence without objection to support the government's case. Applicant\ntestified. The record remained open until September 30, 2009 (Tr. 47), to allow\nApplicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. No evidence was submitted.\nDOHA received the transcript on September 24, 2009. The record closed on September\n30, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges drug involvement (Guideline H) and personal conduct\n(Guideline E). Applicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d., but denied\nsubparagraph 1.e., alleging that he still associates with individuals that used drugs with\nhim in the past. He admitted both allegations under personal conduct (Guideline E) in\nParagraph 2. \nApplicant is 22 years old. It is not clear from the record when he was married. In\nhis SCA (GE 1) he was single on December 8, 2006, the day he signed the SCA. His\ndaughter was born on February 1, 2006 (GE 1 at 2). Applicant has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since November 2006. Currently, he is an installation technician\nhoping to become an electronics technician, then an engineering technician (Tr. 27). \nDrug Involvement \nApplicant was nervous when he began his testimony. He had some difficulty\nproviding a history of his drug use (Tr. 13-17). He told the OPM investigator in\nSeptember 2008, that he smoked an average of one marijuana cigarette a day between\nages 15 and 17 (GE 2). Applicant told the investigator he stopped using marijuana in\n2004 (Id.). He testified he quit using marijuana in 2005 after beginning a relationship\nwith his former wife (Tr. 13-14). \nMarital discord developed between Applicant and his former wife in April 2008.\nHe resumed using marijuana two or three times a week, and after being granted a\nsecurity clearance on March 31, 2007. He took a random drug test and registered\npositive for marijuana in June 2008. His employer referred him to outpatient counseling\n(Tr. 16). \n\n3\nThe counseling, which began in June 2008, consisted of individual therapy with a\ncounselor for at least seven or eight sessions (GE 2, interview). Applicant completed the\ncounseling in November 2008 (Tr. 16). Applicant\u2019s counselor wrote a report indicating\nthat Applicant was a high risk for marijuana use but not drug dependent (GE 2,\ninterview). Applicant testified that he no longer associates with friends who used\nmarijuana with him in the past (Tr. 25). \nApplicant finally told his wife to leave in April 2008 and she departed with his car\nand their child (Tr. 18-20). Applicant obtained a divorce on August 3, 2009 (Id.). \nPersonal Conduct\nOn December 8, 2006, Applicant completed a SCA. In response to question 24a.\n(use of drugs since 16 or in the last seven years), Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d In his\nanswer to the SOR, he admitted he intentionally concealed his marijuana use. At the\nhearing, he confirmed his deliberate concealment of his drug use to get a job (Tr. 26).  \nWhole Person Information\nDuring the course of his testimony, Applicant referred to documentation that he\nindicated he could obtain (Tr. 11, 23-25, 29, 30-33). Though he was provided two weeks\nto submit documentation regarding his job performance, negative drug test results, and\nhis drug counselor\u2019s post therapy report, Applicant did not submit additional\ndocumentation. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nused in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on common sense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" Finally, the administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical, and based on the evidence\n\n4\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in demonstrating it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him security clearance access. \nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules or regulations.\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement falls within the scope of AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug\nabuse); AG \u00b6 25(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use); AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia); and AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use\nafter being granted a security clearance). Marijuana, an illegal drug, is defined by the\nguideline as a mood and behavior altering substance. In June 2008, Applicant tested\npositive for marijuana. He used the drug with varying frequency from 2002 to June\n2008. The most bothersome aspect of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is that he used the\ndrug while holding a security clearance. The government has established a case of drug\nabuse under the drug involvement guideline. \nApplicant has the burden of presenting evidence in explanation, mitigation, and\nextenuation, that meets his ultimate burden of persuasion. AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply because his drug use did not stop\nuntil June 2008, less than two years ago. Applicant was using the drug two or three\ntimes a week for several months. His decision not to furnish probative documentation in\nsupport of his good job performance, negative drug tests, and written drug report\nverifying he completed drug therapy, continues to have a negative impact on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, (2) changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs are used, (3) an appropriate period of abstinence, and a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation)\nprovides four actions an applicant may take to demonstrate he intends to maintain drug\n\n5\nabstinence in the future. While Applicant stresses that he no longer associates with drug\nusers as set forth in AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), he provided insufficient evidence to support his\nposition. He provided insufficient evidence to substantiate his claim that he abstains\nfrom environments where drugs are used (AG \u00b6 26(b)(2)). \nWhether an appropriate period of abstinence from illegal drug use AG 26 (b)(3) is\nsufficient depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Applicant did not stop\nusing marijuana until he was caught in June 2008, less than two years ago. He used the\ndrug while holding a security clearance. A longer period of abstinence is necessary\nunder these circumstances. Without a written declaration of intent to forego future drug\nuse (AG 26(b)(4)), Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence under any of the four\navenues of demonstrating an intent to refrain from all drug use in the future. The drug\ninvolvement guideline is resolved against Applicant. \nPersonal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThis guideline applies to intentional attempts to conceal or omit information from\nan SCA. Applicant\u2019s admission of both subparagraphs of paragraph 2 of the SOR\nestablishes that he deliberately concealed drug information because he needed the job.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire to determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness)\napplies to Applicant\u2019s deliberate concealment of his drug history.\nApplicant\u2019s decision to resume marijuana use in April 2008 brings his conduct\nwithin AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is\nnot limited to: . . . (3) a pattern of rule violations); . . . .). Applicant\u2019s resumption of\nmarijuana use constitutes a violation of not only the law, but also the Department of\nDefense policy against illegal drug use. \nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. Those conditions are: AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense was so minor, or so much time\nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\n\n6\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur).\nApplicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a) or AG \u00b6 17(c). While his\nmarijuana use stopped two years before his deliberate concealment of that information\nin December 2006, he demonstrated poor judgment in April 2008 by resuming use of\nthe drug while holding a security clearance. The fact that his wife and child suddenly left\nhim in April 2008, was clearly a traumatic event. However, her departure does not\nexcuse him from breaking the law while holding a security clearance. \nApplicant receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d) because he acknowledges\nhe used marijuana and he had drug counseling. But his admission of drug use and\ncounseling is insufficient to overcome his deliberate falsification of his earlier drug use,\nand his drug use between April and June 2008. The personal conduct guideline is found\nagainst Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate findings against Applicant under the drug and personal conduct guidelines. I\nhave also weighed the circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the\nwhole person concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant used marijuana daily between ages 15 and 17. He claims he stopped\nusing the drug in 2005. During a period of marital discord in April 2008, Applicant\nresumed using the drug about two or three times a week. By resuming marijuana use,\nApplicant violated the drug laws and the zero tolerance policy of the Department of\nDefense against drug use while holding a security clearance. The credit Applicant\nreceives for stopping his marijuana use in June 2008 is tempered by the fact he was\ncaught using marijuana by a random drug test. \n\n7\nApplicant has the burden of proving his security worthiness. He testified he had\nfavorable job performance evidence, a favorable drug report, and negative test results.\nHis decision not to reinforce his testimonial claims with independent evidence raises a\nreasonable inference that the evidence does not exist. Applicant has not demonstrated\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to restore his security clearance.\nAccordingly, the drug involvement and personal conduct guidelines are found against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.             \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on March 12, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 18,\n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 5, 2010. The Government\noffered Exhibits (GE 1-5), which were received into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified on her own behalf and presented the testimony of one witness. She\nsubmitted Exhibits (AE A-H), at the hearing which were admitted into the record without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript on April 13, 2010. Based upon a review of the\nJuly 2, 2010\n\n2\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated February 22, 2010, Applicant admitted in part\nand denied in part the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.a. of the SOR.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1978 and college in 1985. Applicant is divorced and has two children.\nShe has been with her current employer since March 2005. (Tr. 53) She has held a\nsecurity clearance since January 2006. (Tr. 53)\nIn November 2007, Applicant visited her dentist who referred her to an\nendodontist. After a November 12, 2007 root canal, she received a prescription for\nPercocet. (AE A) Due to the continuing pain, she received another prescription on\nNovember 16, 2007. (Tr. 18) She photocopied the prescription and had it filled on\nDecember 4, 2007. (Tr. 21; 70) She admits that she made several photocopies of the\nprescription. (Tr. 43)\nIn November, Applicant also learned that her husband was having an affair and\nspending all her money on another woman. (GE 2) He was also addicted to internet\npornography. (AE F) She was facing the loss of her nine-year relationship. Applicant\ndescribes this as a \u201cvery dark time in her life.\u201d She stated she was overwhelmed with\ngrief and uncertainty, and she made some bad errors in judgment. (GE 2) She reported\nthat she was \u201can emotional wreck.\u201d (Answer to SOR)\nOn December 11, 2007, Applicant\u2019s husband dropped off her prescription for\nPercocet (12 tablets). The prescription was also a photocopy of a November 16, 2007\nprescription prescribed by her dentist. After calling the dentist and learning that\nApplicant was no longer under his care, the pharmacy alerted the local police due to the\npossible fraud. (GE 3)\nThe fraud unit conducted an investigation. Applicant admitted to the police\ndetective, after first denying the forgery allegation, that she had photocopied the\nprescription, dated November 16, 2007. She blamed her relationship problems and\nfinancial upheaval for her bad judgment. She also stated that her husband had \u201cflushed\u201d\nher medications. Ultimately, she accepted responsibility for the alteration of the\nprescription. (GE 3) \nApplicant disclosed to the police that she used other prescription medications for\nchronic back pain, and other health problems. She denied that she had ever \u201cforged\u201d\nany of those prescriptions. (GE 3) In a follow-up police interview on December 12, 2007,\nApplicant revealed that she thought she had filled the November 16, 2007 prescription\nduring the week of December 4, 2007. The police confiscated the prescription from\nanother pharmacy. (GE 3) After the conclusion of the investigation, a report, dated\n\nApplicant received one charge (felony summons) in March 2008. She discussed the 2007 drug charge in her\nOPM interview. Although there was no specific reference to the December 4, 2007 prescription refill, she was\nnot charged with that offense. This was one period of time in 2007. Applicant admitted to a \u201cone time error of\njudgment.\u201d She was charged based on the December 11, 2007 offense.  \n3\nDecember 17, 2007, was completed. The evidence invoice, attached to the report,\nnoted two photocopied November 16, 2007 prescriptions. One filled on December 4,\n2007 and the other attempted to be filled on December 11, 2007. (GE 3) \nOn March 19, 2008, Applicant was served a Felony Summons for the charge of\nControlled-Substance-Obtain Fraud/Deceit (Felony 6) based on the police investigation.\nApplicant pled guilty. She received a deferred sentence for a term of two years.\nApplicant was ordered to complete 48 hours of useful public service as a condition of\nher probation. Applicant completed her community service in a timely manner. She\ncompleted her community service in a women\u2019s shelter. She wanted to help other\nwomen who had made poor choices in their life. Applicant learned that most of the\nwomen were in the shelter as a result of a court order. She learned about rehabilitation\nand what it means to move forward with her life. She observed the counseling and other\nprograms. She listened to the stories of other women. She learned about humility, and\nshe believes she is now a better person because of her community service experiences.\nApplicant complied fully with all conditions imposed by the court. Her probation\nofficer confirmed Applicant\u2019s assertion in a letter submitted for the record. (AE B) During\nher probation, Applicant completed court-appointed counseling. She also paid her fines\nand court fees. \nDue to Applicant\u2019s success while on the deferred sentence, Applicant\u2019s probation\nwas ended after more than one year in July 2009. The case was then dismissed by\ncourt order on July 21, 2009. (AE C)\nWhen Applicant completed her July 15, 2008, security clearance application she\nanswered Section 23 concerning her police record. She disclosed that she had been\ncharged with a felony offense in December 2007. She provided details concerning the\nattempt to obtain the Percocet (a controlled substance) by a photocopy of a\nprescription.  (GE 1)\n1\nAt the hearing, Applicant expressed great remorse and shame for the offense.\nShe blamed her behavior on many reasons relating to a common law marriage that was\nin crisis at the time. She claims she was depressed about the emotional upheaval in her\nlife. She was also in great pain from the dental work. She also said that she did not\nhave money to return to get the tooth repaired completely. She acknowledged that she\nclearly was using poor judgment at the time. However, she admitted that is not an\nexcuse to break the law. \nShe also acknowledged that she has taken prescribed Percocet and Vicodin on\nand off for approximately nine years for her chronic back pain. (Tr. 75) Applicant\n\nApplicant was credible in her testimony that she focused on the March 2008 charge in her answers prior to\nthe hearing. She did not remember that she had filled a prescription on December 4, 2007. The police report\nconsidered that information and charged Applicant based on the December 11, 2007 incident. The SOR\nalleged conduct under Guideline J and not under Guideline E.\n4\nexplained that she has never used illegal drugs. She has no prior criminal record. She\ndivorced her common law husband in 2008. She is calm and not in turmoil. She is not\nrequired to attend any other drug counseling because she uses prescription\nmedications on a daily basis. Her dentist and another doctor spoke to police about\nApplicant and both believed that Applicant was \u201cnot a drug seeker.\u201d (AE A)\nApplicant was candid at the hearing that she believed the reason that she\nphotocopied the November 16, 2007 prescription was fear of not having sufficient\nmoney to return to the dentist. She wanted to have medication for the pain. She admits\nthat there was no logic to this plan. (Tr. 102) Despite the many reasons that Applicant\nbelieved she had for photocopying the prescription, she pled guilty and completed the\nconditions for her deferred sentence in one year rather than two years.2\nApplicant\u2019s employer describes her as a superior employee who has consistently\nachieved solid results during her five years with the company. Applicant was promoted\ndue to her dedication, customer service, attitude and overall professionalism. (AE B)\nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals from 2005 to 2009 confirm that her good\nperformance is better than most of the individuals in her position level. Her work rarely\nrequires corrections or review. Her work is consistently complete and error-free.\nApplicant is a team leader who has high standards. Applicant is always available for an\nassignment. She also volunteers for projects. (AE D) \nApplicant has many letters of appreciation and certificates of recognition from\n2007 through 2010. (AE E). Her performance and initiative are consistently noted. She\nwas nominated for a company award for her superior accomplishments. (AE E) \nApplicant\u2019s company Deputy Director believes she is \u201cawesome.\u201d He noted her\nprofessionalism and technical support during Planning and Operations Training in\nFebruary 2010. Applicant constantly demonstrated professionalism, proficiency, and\ncommitment to service. (AE E)\nApplicant\u2019s Chief, Training and Education Center, acknowledged another\n\u201cprofessional job done award\u201d on February 16, 2010. (AE E). Applicant had supported\ntraining for high level clients. \nApplicant\u2019s Company Supervisor, who is a retired Air Force Officer, is aware of\n\u201cher personal troubles.\u201d He submitted a letter to recommend Applicant for retention of\nher security clearance. He states she follows procedures and handles classified\ninformation on a daily basis without any discrepancies. He trusts Applicant, and has\nnever had any concern with her work product in that arena. (AE E)\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s sister testified at the hearing that she is very close to Applicant. She\nknew that something was bothering her sister in 2007, but Applicant would not confide\nin her. (Tr. 135) Applicant\u2019s sister described her as a fine mother and a good provider\nfor her two children. She has never known her sister to have any problems with illegal or\nlegal prescription drugs. (Tr. 137) She regards Applicant as responsible and trustworthy.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By it\u2019s\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant admitted that she photocopied a November 16, 2007 prescription for\nPercocet, a controlled substance. She filled the prescription on December 4, 2007 and\nattempted to fill it again on December 11, 2007. Applicant received a felony summons in\nMarch 2008. She was charged with Controlled Substance-Obtain Fraud/Deceit-Att. After\npleading guilty, she received a deferred sentence of two years supervised probation,\ncommunity service, and a fine. AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c)apply.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred in December 2007. In March 2008,\nApplicant received a felony summons. She pled guilty to the charge and received a\ndeferred sentence and was initially ordered to be on probation for two years. She\nsuccessfully completed her probation in July 2009. Thirty months have elapsed since\nthe incident. Applicant has served her probation and successfully complied with court\norders. It has been almost one year since the probation ended. Applicant does not have\nany other criminal charges or arrests on her record. The case has been dismissed. \n\n7\nApplicant has an excellent employment record. Her supervisor and others\nrecommend her for retention of her security clearance. In her five years of employment,\nshe has not had any issues with handling classified information. She has received\nnumerous awards and letters of appreciation from her employer. She understands the\nimportance of a security clearance. She has complied with the rules and regulations in\nher work environment.\nApplicant is ashamed and remorseful about her behavior in 2007. She had\nseveral reasons for resorting to her criminal behavior in 2007, but she acknowledged\nthat she did not have any excuse for breaking the law. She ultimately pled guilty and\nserved her reduced probation. She is on her own and supporting her family. She had\nbeen a law-abiding citizen her entire life until December 2007.  \nApplicant does not use illegal drugs. Her treating physician and dentist do not\nbelieve that Applicant is a \u201cdrug seeker.\u201d She has used prescribed medications for more\nthan nine years. She has never had any prior difficulties. She believes she has learned\na lesson. She understands that the December 2007 incident was a life-changing one for\nher.  Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply in this case\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a well-educated, highly\nrespected employee. She has held a security clearance since 2006. She has no\nsecurity violations. She has an excellent employment record. Many reference letters\nrecommended Applicant for retention of her security clearance. She has many letters of\nappreciation for her work. Her performance evaluations from 2005 until the present time\nrate her as a \u201csuperior employee.\u201d\n\n8\nApplicant had no record of criminal conduct until the December 2007 incident.\nShe has been on pain medication for many years for a chronic back problem. There had\nnever been an issue prior to the November-December 2007 time frame with her\nprescriptions. Her physicians do not believe she is a \u201cdrug seeker.\u201d She admits that she\nwas not in an emotionally or physically healthy place when she photocopied the\nNovember 16, 2007 prescription. She is now living on her own with her children.\nApplicant was charged in March 2008. She pled guilty and completed her\nprobation. She was successful in completing her program in July 2009 rather than in\nMarch 2010 when it was scheduled to end. The case was dismissed. It is now almost\nthree years since the offense date. \nApplicant was overwhelmed with her personal situation in November 2007. She\nwas trying to cope with her emotional and physical pain. She admitted that during this\nperiod she made errors in judgment. She divorced her husband in 2008. She is no\nlonger vulnerable to the stress that  occurred during that time.\nApplicant has provided solid service to her employer since 2005. She has been\nrecognized time and again. There is every indication that she is an honorable person.\nShe has had no substantiated allegations of security violations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her criminal\nconduct concerns.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant incurred some delinquent debts after a change-of-station move, and\ndue to personnel office errors when he was discharged from the Navy. He worked\naggressively to resolve them all. He used marijuana a few times in high school, and\nonce while camping in 2008. Applicant fully mitigated resulting security concerns. Based\nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on September 17,\n2008. On December 6, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for\nAccess to Classified Information effective within the Department of Defense on\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nSeptember 6, 2011\n\nDiscussion and ruling on the objection are at Tr. 27-32.  \n1\nGE 1; GE 2; Tr. 6, 23, 67.\n2\nAR.\n3\nGE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5.\n4\nGE 6.\n5\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (AR) on December 23, 2010, and\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on March 2, 2011, and the case was assigned to me on April 7, 2011. DOHA\nissued a Notice of Hearing on April 18, 2011, and I convened the hearing as scheduled\non May 12, 2011. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were\nadmitted over Applicant\u2019s objection that evidence concerning his marijuana use during\nhigh school should be excluded as irrelevant.  Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through\n1\nM, which were admitted without objection, and testified on his own behalf. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until June 6, 2011, for submission of\nadditional evidence. On May 20 and 23, 2011, Applicant submitted additional evidence\nthat was marked AE N, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on May 24, 2011. No further evidence was submitted, and the record\nwas closed as scheduled.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has\nworked since October 2006. He was honorably discharged from the Navy in September\n2006 after 8 years of active enlisted service that started shortly after his graduation from\nhigh school. He has held security clearance since 2002. He is married, with a nine-year-\nold son.  In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations in\n2\nSOR \u00b6 1, concerning financial issues, and admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2\nconcerning drug involvement.  Applicant\u2019s admissions, including his statements in\n3\nresponse to DOHA interrogatories,  and his sworn statement to a Defense Security\n4\nService special agent on October 30, 2002,  are incorporated in the following findings.\n5\nDuring their last change of duty stations in the Navy, Applicant and his wife lost\ntrack of a few relatively small debts. When they were brought to Applicant\u2019s attention\nthrough his receipt of interrogatories from DOHA, he promptly resolved the $533 credit\ncard debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the $2,253 consumer debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and\ntwo other charged-off credit card accounts for $1 and $652 that were not listed on the\nSOR. Despite substantial efforts to do so, he was unable to identify the creditor involved\nwith the $174 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. That debt only appears on the oldest credit\nreport in the record, on which it was reported to be delinquent since March 2003. It does\nnot appear on any later credit reports. Applicant has never been contacted by anyone\n\nGE 4; GE 7 through 10; Tr. 68-74.\n6\nAR; GE 3; AE B through E; AE G through K; AE N; Tr. 39-53, 56-61.\n7\n3\nattempting to collect this debt, and he has no recollection of any dealings with the listed\ncreditor.6\nApplicant disputes the $15,370 debt to the Defense Finance and Accounting\nService (DFAS) alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He was involuntarily discharged from the Navy in\n2006 as a result of reaching high-year tenure of eight years as an enlisted member in\npaygrade E-4. He was otherwise fully eligible and recommended for reenlistment, and\nhad requested to do so. According to applicable regulations, he should have been\nentitled to full separation pay, which would have been around $20,000 before taxes.\nApplicant was one of more than 300 sailors who were discharged from the aircraft\ncarrier to which he was assigned during September 2006, resulting in some errors by\nthe personnel office. Applicant was placed on 30 days of terminal leave, after which he\nmailed his active duty identification card back to the ship. His discharge was supposed\nto be effective September 14, 2006, and the ship\u2019s personnel office was supposed to\nmail him his discharge certificate (DD-214) upon receipt of his identification card. That\nnever happened, and his multiple attempts to contact the ship for assistance were\nunsuccessful over the next several years. Finally, in 2009, he was told that he would\nhave to contact the Navy Personnel Command (NPC) to request a DD-214. He received\na response from NPC dated August 5, 2009, informing him that there was no DD-214 in\nhis official military personnel file and advising him to contact another office within NPC\nto request a reissued DD-214. He did so, and NPC reissued him a DD-214 on March\n16, 2011. This DD-214 contained an incorrect Separation Code and an incorrect\nReentry Code which, if correct, would indicate that Applicant was only eligible to receive\n50% of full separation pay. Applicant has been diligently working with various Navy\noffices to attempt to correct these errors. He provided complete documentation\nsupporting the validity of his position and entitlement to full separation pay, as well as\nhis ongoing attempts to convince the bureaucracy of the errors involved.    \n7\nAnother consequence of Applicant\u2019s incomplete discharge processing was that\nDFAS continued paying him through direct deposits, as though he remained on active\nduty, for the period from September 2006 through January 31, 2007. Applicant\ncontacted DFAS about this problem several times, but was told that they had no record\nthat he was out of the service. For a reason unknown to Applicant, these payments\nstopped at the end of January 2007 and DFAS subsequently notified him that he had\nbeen overpaid by $14,731 and he was indebted to the Government in that amount. That\ntotal also included recoupment of part of a Selective Reenlistment Bonus he had\npreviously received. On June 29, 2007, he wrote a letter to DFAS explaining that his\nalleged overpayment should be offset by the amount of unpaid separation pay to which\nhe was entitled. DFAS responded to Applicant with an undated letter that gave him\ncredit for half of the full separation pay to which he was entitled, reducing his balance\ndue to $7,910. This reduced amount is reflected in his May 10, 2011 credit report.\nApplicant then offered to compromise the disputed debt for a one-time payment of\n\nGE 3; GE 4; GE 7; AE E; AE F; AE N; Tr. 47-56.\n8\nGE 4; Tr. 74-85.\n9\nAR; GE 2; GE 5; GE 6; AE A; AE N; Tr. 38-39, 86-103.\n10\n4\n$1,500. DFAS rejected this offer in a letter dated May 5, 2011, and put him on a\nrepayment plan of $309.75 per month toward an outstanding balance of $10,685 that\nincludes interest and penalties. Applicant\u2019s first monthly payment under this plan was\ndue on June 4, 2011. He made that payment by money order on May 18, 2011. He\nintends to continue complying with the repayment plan until he convinces the Navy to\ncorrect his DD-214 and credit him with the other half of the separation pay he should\nhave received.8\nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement reflects a monthly surplus of $380,\nwithout including net income of about $600 per month that his wife earns in a job she\nstarted after he submitted the statement. They have about $800 in savings, and\nApplicant has saved about $30,000 in a 401(k) account. Although they have not\nundergone any formal financial counseling, they have become much more careful and\norganized in managing their budget and bills in order to prevent any recurrence of\ndelinquent debt.  \n9\nApplicant experimented with smoking marijuana a few times while he was in high\nschool. His initial urinalysis test taken when he entered the Delayed Entry Program in\n1996, at age 16, was positive for marijuana. He never used marijuana while in the Navy,\nor after leaving the Navy except for one time on or about July 25, 2008. During a\nweekend camping trip with some former friends, Applicant smoked some marijuana that\none of the other campers provided and passed around. He did so after having a few\ndrinks, and due to peer pressure. He regretted having done so the next morning. During\nthe following week, Applicant\u2019s employer announced that all employees would be\nsubject to an unannounced urinalysis drug test. Applicant immediately told his\nsupervisor that he had used marijuana the previous weekend and might test positive.\nHis employer treated this as a self-referral, and told him to go ahead and take the test.\nHis urine tested positive for marijuana, at a low level. He underwent a drug evaluation\nby a counselor at his company\u2019s Employee Assistance Program (EAP), who determined\nthat there was no need for substance abuse treatment. Applicant successfully\ncompleted a six-session EAP counseling program from August through October 2008.\nHe has subsequently tested negative for drugs and alcohol on unannounced random\nurinalysis tests during September 2008, December 2008, December 2009, June 2010,\nand October 2010. He also tested negative on a series of urinalysis tests administered\nin connection with an investigation into a job-related injury. He no longer sees the\nformer friends with whom he smoked the marijuana, is extremely remorseful for having\ndone so, and sincerely and credibly expressed his intention never to illegally use drugs\nin the future. He also signed a letter to that effect, agreeing to automatic revocation of\nhis clearance for any future violation.      \n10\n\nAE L; AE M.\n11\n5\nApplicant\u2019s facility security manager submitted a letter praising his dedication,\nloyalty, dependability, and general good character. He also described Applicant\u2019s\nprofessional and personal growth over the past four-and-a-half years, while working\nextremely hard to apply positive lessons learned from his mistakes and showing great\nremorse for his lapse in judgment in July 2008. Applicant\u2019s performance evaluations\nreflect steadily improving technical competence and satisfactory performance.  His\n11\ndemeanor during the hearing was pleasant, open, sincere, and straightforward. His\ntestimony was credible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying\nconditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n6\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe evidence raised initial security concerns under two Guideline F DCs, as set\nforth in AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThere is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending, deceptive or illegal\nfinancial practices, or financial issues caused by any misconduct on Applicant\u2019s part.\nThree of his four SOR-alleged financial problems were minor bills that became\ndelinquent when he and his wife lost track of them during their last Navy change of duty\nstations. He promptly resolved two of them, and two other small credit card debts, when\nhe became aware of them through DOHA financial interrogatories. The final $174 debt\ncould not be resolved because the creditor could not be identified despite diligent efforts\nto do so. This debt was last reported in 2003, has not been pursued by any creditor, and\nno longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. Applicant is complying with an agreed\nrepayment plan concerning his alleged DFAS debt, while still actively pursuing his\nextensive efforts to correct the personnel office errors that led to the problem. The\nevidence establishes Applicant\u2019s temporary failure to satisfy some of his debts, and a\nhistory of not meeting a few minor financial obligations, thereby shifting the burden to\nhim to prove mitigation.\n\n7\nThe guideline includes five MCs in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns\narising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant incurred a modest amount of delinquent debt when he lost track of a\nfew bills during a Navy move. He promptly resolved all but one of them upon learning\nthat they were on his credit report. The unresolved debt was listed only on his oldest\ncredit report, to a creditor he does not recognize and could not locate. Only $174 was\ninvolved, and this is too old and minor to support security concerns in light of his actions\nto resolve all other debts. He has no plans to move again, and earns sufficient income\n(together with his wife\u2019s) to avoid delinquencies in the future. The circumstances giving\nrise to these debts do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s present reliability, judgment, or\ntrustworthiness. The evidence establishes significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a).\nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) was also established with respect to the only\nsignificant debt alleged in the SOR, involving DFAS. Applicant has spent the past five\nyears trying to overcome a nightmare series of errors by the personnel department on\nhis last ship and his resulting pay problems. He has actively and diligently pursued\nofficial channels to correct those errors, with partial success to date. He has entered a\nrepayment plan agreement with DFAS to show good faith while he continues to seek\ncredit for the other half of the separation pay to which he is demonstrably entitled.\nApplicant has not undergone personal financial counseling, but he offered\ndocumentation to establish clear indications that his former problems have been or are\nbeing resolved, and that his financial situation is under control. Thus, substantial\n\nISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App.\n12\nBd. Jul. 6, 2006)). \n8\nmitigation was also established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d). Applicant fully documented\nhis legitimate basis to dispute the debt to DFAS alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, as well as his\nsignificant efforts to resolve the issue, so any security concerns related to that debt are\nalso mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(e). \nAs the Appeal Board has ruled concerning the successful mitigation of security\nconcerns arising from financial considerations, \u201c[a]n applicant is not required to show\nthat [he] has completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established a\nreasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement\nthat plan.\u2019\u201d  This applicant has fully met this standard by resolving almost all of his\n12\nformer delinquencies, and complying with a DFAS repayment agreement while\ncontinuing his legitimate efforts to dispute that debt.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and\nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The DCs raised by the evidence in this case include:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; and \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\n\n9\nApplicant smoked marijuana in late July 2008 while employed in his current\nposition and holding a security clearance. He tested positive for this use on a urinalysis\ntest. He had also smoked marijuana a few times about 15 years ago while in high\nschool, and tested positive for marijuana on a pre-enlistment urinalysis given upon\njoining the Navy\u2019s Delayed Entry Program in 1996. These facts support application of\nthe foregoing DCs, and shift the burden to Applicant to prove mitigation of resulting\nsecurity concerns.\nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation;\n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness\nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended;\nand\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\nApplicant\u2019s high school marijuana experimentation was over 15 years ago, was\ninfrequent, and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or\njudgment as established by his many intervening drug-free years. His single use in 2008\ntook place while camping with old friends who convinced him to share some of their\nmarijuana after he had a few drinks. He realized the wrongfulness of this conduct\nalmost immediately, and has ended all similar activities and contact with those friends.\nEven when viewed together with his high school experimentation, Applicant\u2019s marijuana\nuse was very infrequent and happened so long ago that it does not cast substantial\ndoubt on his current judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. His demonstrated remorse\nand credible expression of resolve convince me that such behavior is highly unlikely to\nrecur. Some mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a) was accordingly established.\n\nTr. 107.\n13\n10\nDepartment Counsel suggested that Applicant\u2019s testing positive on urinalysis\ntests in 1996 and 2008, shortly after two of his admitted three to six possible lifetime\nuses of marijuana was suspicious, and could support an inference of more substantial,\nun-admitted drug abuse.  While such an inference might be supportable under other\n13\ncircumstances, I do not find it to be one that should properly be drawn under the totality\nof the evidence in this case. That evidence is insufficient to support a finding of more\nextensive drug abuse than that to which Applicant candidly admitted. \nApplicant has completely disassociated from drug-using former friends and\ncontacts, and no longer engages in recreational activities where peer pressure to use\nmarijuana might exist. The evidence, including numerous urinalysis tests, indicates that\nhe has been abstinent since July 2008. He also submitted a statement of intent to never\nabuse drugs in the future with automatic revocation for any violation. These facts\nestablish additional mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b).\nThe drug abuse in this case did not involve prescription drugs, so AG \u00b6 26(c) has\nno bearing on this decision. Applicant has not participated in any drug treatment\nprogram, but did successfully complete the EAP counseling that was recommended\nafter his substance abuse evaluation. He was never diagnosed with drug dependence\nor abuse, or recommended for treatment. No favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional was provided, however, so minimal mitigation was established\nunder AG \u00b6 26(d).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \n\n11\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a hard-working\nand dedicated employee. He had fully repaid all but two of his formerly delinquent minor\ndebts several months before the SOR was issued, and has since reached an\nagreement to make payments toward the DFAS debt while he continues to dispute it.\nHe has sufficient income and savings to continued resolution of his one remaining\nallegedly delinquent debt, without the risk of incurring additional debt. He has submitted\ndocumentation through appropriate channels that clearly establishes this debt resulted\nfrom personnel office errors during his discharge process, and that he will ultimately be\nentitled to additional funds from DFAS rather than owing money to them. \nApplicant is a mature and experienced individual, who is fully accountable for his\nsituation and intends to continue resolving his obligations. The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress is minimal, and he has demonstrated a pattern of\nfinancial responsibility and ability to remain solvent in the future. He made one bad\ndecision in July 2008 to share some marijuana with old friends with whom he went\ncamping for a weekend. He has since compellingly demonstrated his remorse over that\nchoice, his determination to never abuse drugs in the future, and lifestyle changes\nnecessary to be successful. The likelihood of future financial troubles or drug abuse is\nminimal. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial confidence as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He fully met his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and drug\ninvolvement.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 15, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 5, 2010, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The SOR was amended on January 14, 2011 and Applicant \nanswered the amended SOR on February 10, 2011. The case was assigned to me on \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 9, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApril 5, 2011. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 13, 2011. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on May 24, 2011. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 12. Applicant did not object and they were admitted into evidence. Applicant \ntestified and did not offer any exhibits. The record was held open until June 1, 2011 to \nallow Applicant to submit documents. He submitted three documents marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C. Department Counsel did not object and they \nwere admitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 1, \n2011.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nThe Government amended the SOR and withdrew all Guideline B and E \nallegations under paragraphs 1 and 3. It withdrew \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. It renumbered \u00b6 2.c, \n2.d and 2.e, and designated them \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. It added \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g \nto the SOR.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.g and admitted the remaining SOR \nallegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old computer administrator. He married in 2002 and \ndivorced in 2009. He has one child from the marriage and pays child support. He \nremarried in September 2010. His wife is a student. Applicant completed three years of \ncollege, but did not earn a degree. However, he has been accepted into an executive \nmaster\u2019s of business administration program at a prestigious university. He works for a \nfederal contractor and has held a secret security clearance since 2003.1  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that in about 2002 or 2003, he bet on sporting events through \nan off-shore betting organization. He estimated he bet about $20,000. He has not \nparticipated in any similar activity since then. He could not recall if he lost money or won \nmoney, but either way it was not a substantial amount. He does not intend to participate \nin any similar activity in the future. His actions were legal.2  \n \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant provided a personal financial statement that \nindicated he had approximately $1.1 million in assets. Of that, approximately $880,000 \nwas real estate that he owned. He estimated the mortgages on the properties to be \nabout $800,000.3  \n \n \n \n \n1 Tr. 69-70. \n \n2 Tr. 19-21, 71, 74-77. \n \n3 Tr. 21-22; GE 4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIn August 2001, Applicant purchased a home for $260,000. When he applied for \nthe mortgage he was employed. The day before he was to close on the house, he lost \nhis job. He was employed in the computer field and the 2000 \u201ctech bubble\u201d burst. \nApplicant was 23 years old at the time and had been earning $95,000. He had made a \ndown payment of $17,500 on the home. At the time, he had been working for five years \nand was frugal and saving his money. He always contributed the maximum amount \nallowable to his IRA and pension plan, thereby reducing his taxable income. Because \nhe had savings he was able to complete the purchase of the house. He took a job at a \nretail electronics store and earned about $33,000 annually. He had two others living in \nthe house with him who paid a portion of the mortgage. Applicant was able to continue \nto make his mortgage payments on the house.4  \n \n \nIn March 2004, Applicant purchased another house. He saw what he believed \nwas a good opportunity to purchase another house. He purchased it for $352,000. He \nhad sufficient equity in his first house to obtain a loan, but needed cash for the \ntransaction, so he borrowed $35,000 from his father to use to purchase the new house. \nHe did not have enough time to get an equity loan from his first house to complete the \npurchase of the second house. However, he did get the loan later and immediately \nrepaid his father. It is alleged that Applicant was earning around $59,654 at the time he \npurchased the second home. Applicant credibly testified that his annual income was \n$75,000. Each year he would reduce his taxable income by making IRA and pension \ncontributions. He also was frugal and saved his money throughout the years. In 2004, \nthe computer field began to rebound and salaries increased.5  \n \n \nBetween January 2007 and January 2008, Applicant purchased three investment \nproperties. At the time, his adjusted gross income was about $94,000 annually, but his \nactual gross income was about $125,000, because he maximized his IRA and pension \ncontributions. He sold his first house and made a profit of $140,000. He used some of \nthe money to purchase a car, some was put into savings and stock trading, and some \nhe used to purchase the properties. He researched the real estate market and found an \narea where real estate rentals would be good cash flow properties. After he selected a \nlocation, he purchased three properties for a total of about $170,000. Two properties \nrequired a 10% down payment (about $4,000 each) and the third required a 20% down \npayment (about $16,000). Applicant had sufficient assets to purchase these properties.6  \n \n \nApplicant participated in short-term option trading in the stock market. Financial \ninstitutions are required to report the cumulative total amount of trades, including both \npurchases and sales for the year. Applicant\u2019s financial statement shows this cumulative \nnumber. This is not the amount of cash that Applicant has, but rather the total amount of \ntransactions that occurred in the year. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that in 2007 Applicant had \n \n4 Tr. 42-47. \n \n5 Tr. 47-51. \n \n6 Tr. 51-57. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n$707,990 in cash. This is incorrect. In 2007, Applicant had about $86,000 in the account \nalleged. In 2008, the amount was about $93,000. Depending on the market, and \nApplicant\u2019s success or failure in trading, this amount fluctuated. In May 2009, \nApplicant\u2019s investment accounts, which included his Individual Retirement Account \n(IRA) and his 401K retirement account, had $78,266 and $56,192 in them, respectively. \nApplicant has not actively traded in the stock market since May 2009.7  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged that Applicant did not file his 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 tax \nreturns until September 28, 2008. Applicant had an accountant complete his federal and \nstate income tax returns. In response to the Government\u2019s request that he provide \ncopies of past tax returns, Applicant contacted his accountant and requested copies of \nthe returns. The accountant copied the tax returns and included a cover letter dated \nSeptember 28, 2008. Applicant provided documents from the IRS showing he filed his \ntaxes timely. Applicant filed his taxes timely and received refunds.8 Applicant estimated \nhis current gross salary is about $175,000, and he also receives additional commission \ncompensation.9  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n7 Tr. 22-41; 65-69; GE 9, 10, 11, 12. \n \n8 AE A, B, C. \n \n9 Tr. 41, 57-62; GE 5, 6, 7, 8. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19, and conclude none apply. \nApplicant has been working since he was 18 years old. He has saved and invested his \nmoney frugally. His assets are consistent with a person who saves and invests his \nmoney wisely. He had one situation in 2002 and 2003, where he participated in sports \nbetting, but his actions were not illegal. He no longer participates in this activity. A \nmisunderstanding by the Government of certain financial documents, led it to believe \nthat Applicant had financial affluence beyond the actual value of his assets. Applicant is \nnot living beyond his means. He is not overextended. To the contrary, he does not have \nany delinquent debts and his current salary is substantial. The Government also \nmisinterpreted the documents his accountant provided regarding Applicant\u2019s tax returns. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThere is no evidence he failed to file his taxes on time. The Government failed to \nprovide evidence to convince me that any of the disqualifying conditions under \nGuideline F apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but others warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nyoung, intelligent, ambitious, and financially savvy. He has saved his money, invested it \nin real estate and the stock market, and continued to advance in his career. He \nconsistently filed his taxes on time. There is no indication of financial problems in his \nbackground, or suspicious activity that raises concern about affluence that cannot be \nexplained. He has consistently filed his taxes on time. There was no evidence \npresented by the Government to raise any security concerns. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the sole SOR allegation, \u00b6 1.a. He admits that he had the credit card but claims his former employer is responsible for the debt. Applicant is a 36-year-old senior field service representative employed by a Department of Defense contractor seeking to maintain his security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since October 2007. From July 10, 1991, to October 16, 1999, he served on active duty in the United States Army. He separated with an honorable discharge in the pay grade of E-5. He has worked for numerous defense contractors after separating from active duty. He is divorced and has two children, a daughter, age 15, and a son, age 10. (Tr at 46-48; Gov 1; Gov 3.) The sole allegation in the SOR is a $63,519 AMEX credit card that was opened in August 2002 and placed for collection in January 2003. It is listed as an individual account on a credit report dated October 23, 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2; Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 4) Applicant claims the AMEX card was a company credit card account which was issued to him during his employment with Company S from August 2002 to August 2003.

Eisen, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86) on October \n23, 2007. On July 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concern under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 8, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October \n14, 2009. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 16, 2009. \nOn October 22, 2009, the case was transferred to me. On October 26, 2009, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for November 16, 2009. The case was \nheard on that date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant testified and offered one exhibit which \nwas marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The record was held open until November 30, \nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  He timely submitted an 18-\npage document that was admitted as AE B. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE B is \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript was received on November 25, 2009.  \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the sole SOR allegation, \u00b6 1.a. He \nadmits that he had the credit card but claims his former employer is responsible for the \ndebt.    \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior field service representative employed by a  \nDepartment of Defense contractor seeking to maintain his security clearance. He has \nworked for his current employer since October 2007. From July 10, 1991, to October 16, \n1999, he served on active duty in the United States Army. He separated with an \nhonorable discharge in the pay grade of E-5. He has worked for numerous defense \ncontractors after separating from active duty. He is divorced and has two children, a \ndaughter, age 15, and a son, age 10. (Tr at 46-48; Gov 1; Gov 3.)  \n \nThe sole allegation in the SOR is a $63,519 AMEX credit card that was opened \nin August 2002 and placed for collection in January 2003. It is listed as an individual \naccount on a credit report dated October 23, 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2; Gov 3 at 2; Gov \n4 at 3; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 4) \n \nApplicant claims the AMEX card was a company credit card account which was \nissued to him during his employment with Company S from August 2002 to August \n2003. Applicant worked for Company S in Colombia. He claims the AMEX card was \nused for official expenses. Although the AMEX card was in his name, he claims he \nnever received a bill from the credit card company. (In his response to the SOR, his \nlawyer indicates that the AMEX credit card statements were mailed to his address in the \nUnited States instead of to his residence in Colombia.) He claims he would file expense \nreports with Company S and assumed Company S paid the credit card bill. (Tr at 34; \nGov 2 at 5) \n \nHe did not discover the delinquent credit card account until 2004 when he \nattempted to purchase a house. He retained Mr. C., a family friend, to serve as his \nmortgage broker and financial advisor.  Applicant provided a power of attorney to Mr. \nC.\u2019s company to act on his behalf.  Mr. C. disputed the delinquent accounts that were \nlisted on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. Ten delinquent accounts were listed. Nine of the \naccounts were successfully removed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The AMEX \ncredit card account was not removed. Mr. C. advised Applicant not to contact the credit \ncard company directly because he might be held liable for the account and/or toll the \nstatute of limitations. Mr. C.\u2019s company did not directly contact AMEX or Company S \nabout the AMEX debt. (Tr at 37, 41; AE B; Gov 2 at 4-5; Gov 3 at 5) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter Applicant left his employment with Company S, he obtained a job as a \ncontract employee for the State Department working in Columbia. At some point, the \ngovernment of Colombia threatened to jail Applicant and deport him because he failed \nto pay income taxes to the government of Columbia. He claimed Company S did not \npay tax withholding to the Colombian government. Applicant claims he contacted \nCompany S to inquire about the taxes owed to the Colombian government and about \nthe AMEX debt. Applicant says that after a long protracted battle with the Colombian \ngovernment, he paid the Colombian government $18,000 in unpaid taxes. It took him \nover three years to be reimbursed by Company S for the unpaid taxes. He testified that \nhe inquired about the AMEX debt at the same time. He claims Company S told him they \nwould look into the credit card issue. After Company S reimbursed him for the taxes, \nApplicant claims that they stopped answering his telephone calls and e-mails.  He \ncontacted his senator to get Company S to pay the tax debt. (Tr at 41-44) \n \nUnder cross examination, Applicant stated that he began contacting Company S \nabout the tax debt owed to the Columbian government in 2002/2003. He stated he was \nnot aware of the AMEX debt at the time. Company S paid him the money for the tax \ndebt in 2004. After Company S reimbursed the money owed for the Colombian tax debt, \nhe became aware of the AMEX debt when he attempted to purchase a house. (Tr at 66-\n67) \n \nApplicant has no documentation of his interaction with Company S about these \nissues. Most of the communication was done over the telephone. (Tr at 69-70) Shortly \nafter receiving the SOR, Applicant contacted his senator\u2019s office to ask for help in \nresolving the issue with the AMEX debt, noting that it was a government contract matter \nand it is prejudicing his ability to remain employed in the defense of the U.S.  The \nsenator\u2019s office contacted Applicant about three weeks prior to the hearing and told him \nthey were pursuing the matter. He claims that Company S contacted him and told him \nhe could resubmit the expense reports for reconsideration. He claims he cannot \nresubmit the expense reports because he no longer has them. He saved copies of his \nexpense reports but he has lost them after moving several times. (Tr at 70-72) \n \nApplicant is waiting for a response from his senator\u2019s office. In October 2009, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel contacted AMEX on two occasions and tried to negotiate a \ncompromise on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  No agreement had been reached at the close of the \nrecord. (Tr at 72; AE A)   \n \nWhen Applicant filed monthly expense reports to Company S, he does not recall \nreceiving notice that payment was received for the expense reports. He claims he never \nreceived statements from the AMEX credit card company directly. When he left his \nemployment with Company S, he returned the AMEX card to the company. He does not \nbelieve Company S checked the AMEX card to make sure there was no outstanding \nbalance. (Tr at 92-93)  \n \nAs of August 24, 2008, Applicant\u2019s net monthly income was $10,300. His monthly \nexpenses include: $1,000 child support, $50 for a credit card, and $100 for a cell phone. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHis total monthly expenses were $1,150. His employer pays all other expenses for him. \nAfter expenses, he has approximately $9,150 left over each month. He has \napproximately $14,000 in a 401K account. (Gov 2 at 5)  \n \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided an e-mail from Colonel M. \nColonel M. has 41 years combined active duty and reserve service in the United States \nArmy. He retired in 2006.  Colonel M. was Applicant\u2019s manager from April 2001 to July \n2002. Applicant was a team leader for maintenance of UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters in \nsupport of the Colombian Army in their efforts for combating the rebel-army FARC. \nColonel M. states Applicant is a loyal and dedicated American with the highest integrity \nand strength of character.  They worked in a hostile environment. Colonel M. trusted \nApplicant with his life and well-being and would do so again without hesitation. Colonel \nM. supervised a team of mechanics in the maintenance of a very complex piece of \nequipment. (AE B at 3-4) \n \nColonel M. stated that company S\u2019s accounting practices were \u201ca shambles.\u201d It \ntook him three years for his personal affairs to be correctly aligned with the U.S. Internal \nRevenue Service. Colonel M. attributes most of the errors to the inaction and repeated \nerrors of Company S. He claims Applicant\u2019s situation with the lack of AMEX payments \nfits the behavior of Company S\u2019s management. (AE B at 3)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s awards and decorations during his active duty military service include \nthe Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army \nAchievement Medal, the Army Superior Unit Award (2nd Award), the Army Good \nConduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Humanitarian Service \nMedal. (Gov 3 at 7) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nwhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant incurred a $63,519 credit card \ndebt that was placed for collection in January 2003. He became aware of the debt in \n2004. At the close of the record, the debt remains unresolved.   \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nAlthough Applicant claims this credit card account was a business account, there is \nnothing in the file to corroborate his assertions. Even if it were to be established that this \nwas a business credit card account, Applicant could still be responsible for paying the \naccount. He provided no evidence pertaining to Company S\u2019s procedures for filing \nexpense reports. He provided no evidence pertaining to who was responsible for paying \nthe credit card account. I cannot rule out the possibility that Applicant was reimbursed \ndirectly by the company after he submitted the expense reports and that he was \nresponsible for paying the credit card account. Nor can I rule out the possibility that \nApplicant made unauthorized charges on the account which Company S refused to pay. \nApplicant was aware of this account since 2004. While he retained Mr. C. as his \nmortgage broker and financial advisor, Mr C.\u2019s company essentially helped Applicant \ndispute items on his credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The credit \nreporting agencies did not remove the AMEX card account from Applicant\u2019s credit report \nafter the dispute because it was established as a valid debt.  Mr C. advised Applicant \nnot to contact the credit card company directly because he could find himself liable for \nthe debt. During the five-year period that he was aware of the debt, Applicant did not \nestablish that he took proactive steps to resolve this debt. While he has worked out of \nthe country for long periods of time, one would assume he would have been more \ninvolved in resolving what he claims to be an unpaid business expense of such \nmagnitude. His lack of action in attempting to get this debt resolved raises questions \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. It was within Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol to monitor his expense reports and his credit card balance to insure that he was \nbeing properly reimbursed. Once he discovered the unpaid AMEX account in 2004, it \nwas his responsibility to contact both Company S and AMEX to resolve the account. \nWhile Colonel M. states Company S\u2019s accounting practices were \u201ca shambles\u201d, no \nspecific details were provided. (I also note Colonel M. was not subject to cross- \nexamination, as such, his statement is given less weight.) He describes an issue that he \nhad with the Internal Revenue Service, but he also indicates he worked the issue for \nthree years until it was resolved. I cannot conclude Applicant worked the issue with his \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAMEX card diligently to get it resolved. While he claims he contacted Company S, there \nis no corroboration in the record evidence that he was in contact with AMEX or \nCompany S to resolve this issue. A reasonable person, upon discovering a $63,000 \nunpaid business credit card account would take more proactive steps to get the \ncompany to reimburse such a large amount.    \n \n  \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant retained Mr. C.\u2019s \ncompany to assist in disputing several delinquent accounts on his credit report under \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act. The $63,519 credit card debt was established as a valid \ndebt. Applicant became aware of this debt in 2004. Mr. C.\u2019s company did not dispute the \naccount until mid-2007.  Applicant\u2019s attorney contacted the credit card company directly \nto negotiate an offer in compromise on two occasions in October 2009, about one \nmonth after Applicant responded to the SOR in this proceeding.  I cannot conclude \nApplicant made a good-faith effort to resolve the AMEX credit card debt.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. Applicant disputes the legitimacy of the past-due debt claiming it \nwas a business credit card that Company S was responsible for paying. He provided no \ndocumentation to substantiate that the AMEX card was a business credit card. It may \nbe, but it was listed as an individual account on the credit report. He provided no \ndocumentation to substantiate that Company S is responsible for paying the balance on \nthe account. Company S recently gave him the opportunity to resubmit the expense \nreports for reconsideration. Applicant claims that he lost the expense reports and is \nunable to resubmit the request.  While he provided a compelling story, he has been \nunable to provide sufficient corroboration to substantiate his basis for dispute.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s service in \nthe military and his employment with various defense contractors since his separation \nfrom the military. I considered Applicant\u2019s claims that the AMEX credit card balance \nshould have been paid by his former employer, Company S. There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude the AMEX debt is Company S\u2019s responsibility. Although Applicant \nclaims he filed expense reports, he no longer has copies of the expense reports \nsubmitted. He did not keep an accurate accounting to ensure that he was being \nreimbursed for expenses during his employment with Company S. He discovered the \ndebt in 2004. While he took some steps to resolve the issue, he does not appear to \nhave been proactive in his efforts to be reimbursed for what he believes is a legitimate \nbusiness expense. His behavior is at odds with what a reasonable person would do if a \n$63,000 debt was discovered on their credit report which they know is not their debt but \nthe responsibility of a former employer. \n \nAt the close of the record, doubts remain because Appellant provided insufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns raised under financial considerations. Mindful \nof my responsibility to rule in favor of national security in cases where there is doubt, I \nfind Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nclearance decision.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and admitted the remaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He served in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1985 to 1993, and was honorably discharged. He is not married and has no children. He worked as a policeman for a university from 1984 to 2005. There is conflicting information provided by Applicant about what he did after he left the police force. It is also unclear if he retired from the police force, or left for another reason. If he retired and receives a pension, he did not list it on his personal financial statement.1 In Applicant\u2019s interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator on October 9, 2008, he stated he took a year off after he retired.2 In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated \u201cYes, I left a job in law enforcement after almost 21 years of service. I did take some time before re-entering the work force.\u201d3 He did not say how much time. He further stated: \u201cI did apply for other law enforcement jobs during that time.\u201d4 His job search in the security/law enforcement field was unsuccessful.5 In August 2006, he accepted employment as an insurance salesman, working on commission. He had \u201clittle success.\u201d6 He then was employed in the car industry from May 2007 to April 2008. He has worked for a federal contractor since April 2008. Applicant stated",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn October 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answered the SOR in writing on November 9, 2009, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 25, 2010. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 8, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nmailed to Applicant, and it was received on February 2, 2010. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant provided additional information. The case was assigned to me on March 9, \n2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and admitted the \nremaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1985 to \n1993, and was honorably discharged. He is not married and has no children. He worked \nas a policeman for a university from 1984 to 2005. There is conflicting information \nprovided by Applicant about what he did after he left the police force. It is also unclear if \nhe retired from the police force, or left for another reason. If he retired and receives a \npension, he did not list it on his personal financial statement.1 In Applicant\u2019s interview \nwith an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator on October 9, 2008, he \nstated he took a year off after he retired.2 In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated \n\u201cYes, I left a job in law enforcement after almost 21 years of service. I did take some \ntime before re-entering the work force.\u201d3 He did not say how much time. He further \nstated: \u201cI did apply for other law enforcement jobs during that time.\u201d4 His job search in \nthe security/law enforcement field was unsuccessful.5 In August 2006, he accepted \nemployment as an insurance salesman, working on commission. He had \u201clittle \nsuccess.\u201d6 He then was employed in the car industry from May 2007 to April 2008. He \nhas worked for a federal contractor since April 2008.  \n \n \nApplicant stated he injured his back in November 2006, and had surgery in April \n2007. During Applicant\u2019s periods of underemployment and unemployment, he used \ncredit cards to pay his bills. He stated: \u201cI do not dispute I have made poor [choices] in \nthe past few years. I have.\u201d7 In his OPM statement from October 2008, he stated that \nnow that he had a good job, he planned to pay off or bring current his past-due debts \nbeginning in January 2009, and satisfying them all within one to two years.8 \n \n1 Item 7. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Response to FORM. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Response to FORM.  \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Item 7. \n\n \n3 \n \n \naid.\n  \nenses. \n                                                          \n \nApplicant stated in response to interrogatories dated February 23, 2009, referring \nto SOR \u00b6 1.b, that: \u201cI have not attempted to settle this account yet.\u201d9 In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($106) and 1.b ($9,450), \nclaiming he paid the debts. The debts are listed on his credit report as delinquent. He \ndid not provide any evidence to support the debts have been p\n10\n \n \nApplicant admitted he owes the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($14,029), 1.d \n($6,064), and 1.e ($12,003). He stated in his response to the FORM that he has \ncontacted the largest account holder and has a settlement \u201cin the works.\u201d11 He did not \nspecifically identify which debt he was referring to. He stated he was waiting to pay his \n2009 income taxes before \u201csettling the remaining items on his credit history.\u201d12 \nApplicant stated he intended to pay all of his delinquent debts. In April 2009, his mother \npassed away and he paid her funeral exp\n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant made two trips to Mexico. He provided a letter from a friend \nconfirming these trips were paid for by the friend, and Applicant helped his friend make \nrepairs on a house owned by the friend that was damaged in two hurricanes.13 \n \n \nApplicant provided in a statement that he took advice from a financial advisor \nregarding his outstanding debt and was advised to settle the debts when he had funds \navailable. He was also advised to purchase a new vehicle, because he was working at a \ncar dealer, to reestablish his credit. Applicant stated he took the advice, but did not \nspecify what he did.14  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n \n9 Item 6. \n \n10 Item 8 is a credit bureau report (CBR) from June 4, 2009. It notes the consumer disputes the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. No other information is provided by Applicant regarding this debt.  \n \n11 Response to FORM. \n \n12 Id.  \n \n13 Id. \n \n14 Item 6. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n5 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has approximately $41,652 in delinquent debt that remains unpaid or \nunresolved. I find both disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has paid or resolved any of his \ndelinquent debts. Therefore, his behavior is recent and the delinquent debts remain a \nconcern. I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s debts \nremain owed and unresolved. Applicant provided some information that he experienced \nperiods of unemployment and underemployment. However, he failed to provide enough \ninformation to determine how long he took off voluntarily after he left the police force, \nwhether he is receiving a pension, how he planned his finances for when he was \n\n \n6 \n \n \nvoluntarily not working, and when he began to use credit cards to pay his bills. I am \nunable to determine that his financial problems were beyond his control, or if he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There is some \nevidence Applicant sought advice from a financial advisor. However, there is not clear \nevidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved or under control. He did \nnot provide evidence that he has made a good-faith effort to pay his delinquent debts or \nattempt to resolve them. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant responded \nthat he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, but did not provide any proof to show he \npaid the debt or resolved it. I find AG \u00b6 20 (e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant received an honorable \ndischarge from the military. He was a policeman for 21 years. I have considered he \nexperienced periods of underemployment and unemployment. I have also considered \nhis medical issue and that he paid for his mother\u2019s funeral expenses. Applicant failed to \nprovide sufficient information to clarify how he financially planned for taking time off after \nhe left the police force. He did not provide documentation to show he paid any of his \ndelinquent debts. He did not provide information that he has a repayment plan or \nsettlement agreement with any of the creditors. He failed to provide sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns. Overall the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant \nfailed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On April 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJune 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 7). Department Counsel \nwas prepared to proceed on May 19, 2009. On May 27, 2009, the case was assigned to \nme. On June 16, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on June \n18, 2009.1 At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 17-18), and Applicant offered three exhibits (Tr. 20-22; AE A-C). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 18), and AE A-C (Tr. 22). Additionally, I \nadmitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 5-7). I received the \ntranscript on June 25, 2009.     \n   \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.c ($450), 1.d ($14,426), 1.e ($628), 1.h ($9,468), 1.i ($18,590), \n1.j ($25,103), 1.k ($3,922), 1.m ($29,104), 1.n ($5,907), 1.p ($570), 1.q ($10,775), 1.r \n($984) and 1.t ($12,280) (GE 7). He denied responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \n($106), 1.g ($183), 1.o ($980), and 1.s ($10,095) (because they duplicate the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.t ($12,280), and 1.l ($374) (GE 7). He described how \nhis debts became delinquent (GE 7). His SOR response was consistent with his hearing \nstatement. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6, 24). He has a \nmaster\u2019s degree in computer science (Tr. 6). He has worked in his current position on \nthe night shift since August 2005 (Tr. 24-25, 59). His monthly net, take home pay is \nabout $3,000 (Tr. 60). In February 2009, he lost his other government contractor job \nafter 21 years of continuous employment with that contractor because of the delay in \nthe adjudication of his clearance (Tr. 25-27).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o ($980) and 1.s ($10,095) are duplications of the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.t ($12,280). The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.t had to file four civil actions to get paid. \nOn October 14, 2008, Applicant completed payment of the debt through garnishment of \nhis pay (Tr. 28-30, 55-57; AE A).   \n \n \n1On May 29, 2009, Department counsel discussed the hearing date, time and location with \nApplicant (Tr. 32). Applicant waived his right to 15 days notice to the date, time and location of his hearing \nand agreed to proceed with his hearing on June 18, 2009 (Tr. 30-32). \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant intends to dispute SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.c ($450), 1.e \n($628), and 1.g ($183) (Tr. 63-65). The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g were for the same \namount. He believed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g were medical debts that \nhis insurance company was supposed to pay (Tr. 65). He intended to dispute two non-\nSOR debts for $139, $450 and $59 because they should have been covered by medical \ninsurance (Tr. 64-65). He did not dispute the other debts (Tr. 66). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f \nis paid (Tr. 77-78).   \n \nIn 1995, Applicant was divorced (Tr. 36). He was responsible for paying $315.17 \nevery two weeks for child support for one child born in 1992 (Tr. 36-37; GE 1). In 2003, \nhe missed four payments; however, now he is paid up and current on his child support \nobligation (Tr. 37). He is obligated to make these payments until his child reaches the \nage of 18 in January 2010 (Tr. 38). \n \nApplicant fell behind on his debts in 2002 (Tr. 33). His girlfriend/partner \ncontracted leukemia and Applicant helped her with her debts (Tr. 35, 57-58). He co-\nowns a house with her and when she was ill, he contributed about $2,000 monthly to \nher (Tr. 44-45). She had some income from her former husband and from some \ninvestments (Tr. 58). The mortgage on the property where she lives is current (Tr. 45). \nApplicant now lives in an apartment in a different state from the state where the \nmortgaged property is located (Tr. 45). \n \nApplicant charged his bills on his credit cards, while still believing that he could \nsell some property and use his profits to pay his debts (Tr. 35). He sold two properties \nbefore he really wanted to do so, and used the profits to pay daily living expenses (Tr. \n35). In the fall in 2002, Applicant sought assistance from and signed a contract with a \ndebt consolidation company (DCC) (Tr. 39). He worked with the DCC for about six \nweeks (Tr. 40). He terminated his agreement with DCC because their charges were too \nhigh (Tr. 40-41). His employer did not recommend any particular debt counseling or \ndebt consolidation company (Tr. 42). In 2003, he went to another debt consolidation \ncompany and they recommended that he declare bankruptcy (Tr. 43-44). He did not \nwant to use bankruptcy to avoid repayment of his creditors (Tr. 43). By 2004, his real \nestate investment properties were sold (Tr. 51-52). After 2004, he did not receive any \nother debt counseling or work with any debt consolidation companies (Tr. 41-42, 44).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s partner lives in the only real estate where Applicant has an ownership \ninterest (Tr. 51). Applicant owns two cars (Tr. 46). The newest one is 14 years old (Tr. \n46). There are no liens on his cars (Tr. 46). He does not have a checking account (Tr. \n47). His other bank accounts have very limited funds (Tr. 47). He does not have any \nother non-bank financial-type accounts (Tr. 49). He cashed out his 401K and pension \nplan in March or April of 2009 and received about $30,000 (Tr. 49-50). He used the \nfunds for living expenses for the house where his partner lived and for his living \nexpenses in another state (Tr. 50-51). His total assets are about $2,000 (primarily \nclothes, laptop computer, and two old cars) (Tr. 74-75). \n \nApplicant informed the credit card account creditors that the accounts should be \nclosed, and he would pay when he was able (Tr. 53-54). He plans to pay his delinquent \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndebts a little at a time (Tr. 52, 66). He has learned to keep his expenses low, and \nmaintains a lower standard of living than previously when his income was higher. For \nexample, he did not purchase newer cars. His frugal spending habits increased \navailable funds to address his debts (Tr. 52). He recently asked the mortgage holder \n(mortgage amount: $205,000) to reduce his payments (Tr. 69; AE C). He was optimistic \nabout the future, noting his plan to reduce his payments to his partner next month, and \nhis payments to support his child would end early in 2010 (Tr. 67, 73). When he has \nfunds accrued, he intends to contact his creditors and negotiate settlements (Tr. 68). \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement showed his approximate monthly expenses \n($5,609) substantially exceeded his approximate monthly income from his current \nemployment ($3,000) mostly because he has two households that he is attempting to \nsupport (Tr. 70-73; AE C). Before he lost his primary employment in February 2009, he \nhad sufficient income to pay his expenses. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and, \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his SF-86, his credit reports (GE 3, 4, AE B), his SOR response \nand at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further \ninquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n   \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of the real estate downturn as well as his support for his \ngirlfriend/partner, who has cancer. He receives some mitigating credit because his \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur;\u201d \nhowever, the problem of about $118,847 in delinquent debt continues to \u201ccast doubt on \n[his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He established that he paid \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t ($12,280) and 1.f ($106) and he is current on his mortgage and \nhis expenses of daily living, such as his rent. He disputes five debts mostly because he \nbelieves they are covered by medical insurance and one is a telephone company debt: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($105), 1.b ($183), 1.c ($450), 1.e ($628), and 1.l ($374). Three debts are \nduplications of other debts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.o and 1.s. He has promised to pay the \nremaining debts; however, that promise is unlikely to successfully resolve his debts as \nindicated by the lack of meaningful progress he has demonstrated over the last four \nyears.    \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received some financial counseling and \nworked with a debt consolidation program in 2003 for about six weeks. However, there \nare not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d because \nten debts totaling about $118,847 remain unresolved. He has also established some, \nbut not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed some, recent good faith3 in \nthe resolution of his SOR debts by paying one large debt through garnishment of his \npay.    \n \nApplicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity of any debts. \nHowever, I will apply AG \u00b6 20(e) because he credibly disputes five small debts totaling \nabout $1,500, which is less than two percent of his total delinquent debt. His overall \nrecent conduct; however, does not show that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.4  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last four years, he has not done anything \nto address ten delinquent debts, totaling $118,847, even though up until February 2009 \nhe had sufficient funds from his two jobs to make greater progress.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is insufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation(s). He is a law-abiding citizen. His current financial problems were caused by \nsome factors partially or fully beyond his control: (1) insufficient income, (2) the real \nestate downturn, and (3) his girlfriend/partner\u2019s cancer. He paid two SOR debts. His \npays his current living expenses. He pays his rent, mortgage and utilities. Five SOR \ndebts are disputed. Three SOR debts are duplications. He has a plan to pay his other \nSOR debts. He does not have any credit cards.  \n \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. Up to February 2009, he \nhad been employed by the same defense contractor for 21 years. This stable \nemployment and contributions to a defense contractor speaks well for his character. In \nFebruary 2009, he lost that employment because of his security clearance problem \nrelating to his delinquent debts. He still holds employment on the night shift with another \ngovernment contractor. He understands how to budget and what he needs to do to \nestablish his financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism \nand trustworthiness through his 21 years of service to the Department of Defense as a \ncontractor. These factors, especially his past government service, show substantial \nresponsibility. However, all of these positive attributes are insufficient to mitigate \nsecurity concerns at this time.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent more than four years ago. Through those four \nyears, up to February 2009, he should have made greater progress addressing his \ndelinquent debts. He has admitted a total of ten delinquent debts, totaling $118,847, \nand he has not paid anything to these 10 creditors in at least four years. He showed \nsome effort to increase his income by working two jobs, but he did not make enough \neffort to reduce his expenses until recently. Ultimately, he did not establish that he acted \nwith sufficient effort and self-discipline to resolve his delinquent debts and to better \ndocument his remedial efforts. All the factors considered together show too much \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfinancial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises \nunmitigated security concerns.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not sufficiently \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e to 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h to 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m and 1.n: \n Against Applicant \n Subparagraph 1.o: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p to 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.s and 1.t: \nFor Applicant \n  \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 30-year-old advance administrative specialist who has worked for the same defense contractor since February 2008. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2007. With the help of student loans, she is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree.1 Applicant is the mother of four young children and is currently single. In 1996, when Applicant was 17 years old, she met a man with whom she had a baby. The couple lived together until 2000, when they had a second child. In about June 2000, the man left her. Initially, he did not provide any form of child support. He also left her with the bills from jointly-held accounts. Consequently, Applicant had started accumulating debts by the time she was 21 years old. Since then, Applicant has balanced motherhood and college courses with a variety of temporary jobs. Most of her temporary jobs were as an administrative assistant or a receptionist. While being a \u201ctemp\u201d gave her flexibility, it did not provide her with health insurance benefits. Lacking health insurance, she was unable to pay for her medical expenses. Today, she has a significant amount of delinquent medical debt.

On \nJuly 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nOn August 7, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. She admitted all 23 of the \nallegations raised in the SOR, representing an approximate sum of $19,300 in \ndelinquent debt, acknowledged a 2003 bankruptcy discharge, and confirmed that her \nmonthly expenses exceed her monthly income. She also requested a hearing before a \nDOHA Administrative Judge. I was assigned the case on September 9, 2009. The \nNovember 18, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                           \nparties proposed an October 20, 2009, hearing. A Notice of Hearing was issued to that \neffect on October 7, 2009. \n \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and offered eight \ndocuments, which I accepted into the record without objection as Exhibits (Exs.) A-H.  \nThose materials documented payment of one of the debts at issue and demonstrated \nthat payments are being made on the balance owed on another account. Also accepted \nwithout objection were four documents from Department Counsel, marked as Exs. 1-4. \nApplicant was given through November 6, 2009, to submit any additional materials. \nApplicant timely submitted three additional documents, accepted without objection as \nExs. I-K. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 28, 2009, and the record was \nclosed. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance \nis denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old advance administrative specialist who has worked for \nthe same defense contractor since February 2008. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nDecember 2007. With the help of student loans, she is currently pursuing a master\u2019s \ndegree.1 Applicant is the mother of four young children and is currently single.  \n \nIn 1996, when Applicant was 17 years old, she met a man with whom she had a \nbaby. The couple lived together until 2000, when they had a second child. In about June \n2000, the man left her. Initially, he did not provide any form of child support. He also left \nher with the bills from jointly-held accounts. Consequently, Applicant had started \naccumulating debts by the time she was 21 years old.   \n \nSince then, Applicant has balanced motherhood and college courses with a \nvariety of temporary jobs. Most of her temporary jobs were as an administrative \nassistant or a receptionist. While being a \u201ctemp\u201d gave her flexibility, it did not provide her \nwith health insurance benefits. Lacking health insurance, she was unable to pay for her \nmedical expenses. Today, she has a significant amount of delinquent medical debt. \n \nApplicant was in another relationship in 2006 which resulted in a third child. This \npartner was abusive and ultimately abandoned her, leaving her with their joint debts. \nThey briefly reconciled in 2008. In January 2009, Applicant was injured and could not \nwork from January 2009 through about March 20092. Unable to generate an income, \nshe relied on worker\u2019s compensation during her convalescence. Later, Applicant took an \nunpaid absence from work for maternity leave from approximately May 4, 2009, through \nabout July 29, 2009. Her partner subsequently abandoned her, again leaving her \nresponsible for their jointly-held debts. She is currently unable to locate the father of her \nyoungest child. She has not pursued legal action against him to secure child support.  \n \n   1 Applicant currently has about $30,000 in student loans. Tr. 24. They are currently deferred. Tr. 76. \n \n   2  Tr. 70. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOver the years, she and her first partner developed an amicable relationship. He \nultimately gave her some financial assistance. In 2009, this partner, now married to \nanother woman, decided to \u201cstep up\u201d and \u201cdo his fatherly duties.\u201d3 Consequently, in late \nAugust 2009, he took over physical and financial responsibility for her two older \nchildren. Applicant retains visitation rights. \n \nApplicant has worked for her current employer for close to two years. She earns \n$16.32 per hour. Both Applicant\u2019s aunt and grandfather provide her with nominal \nfinancial assistance. The SOR raises, and Applicant admits, allegations based on \ndelinquent accounts cited in credit bureau reports from 2009: \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Judgment from about June 2006 for a medical obligation ($1,149). \nUNPAID \u2013 Applicant contacted the provider regarding the bill, but never received a \nresponse. She has not pursued the matter.4 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Collection account for approximately $680. UNPAID. Applicant stated \nthat this balance is in repayment, but provided no evidence of payments being made.5 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.c \u2013 Medical obligation for about $102.

Applicant admitted this debt, but has no idea what it represents.7  \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.e \u2013 Telecommunications account balance for about $572. UNPAID. \nApplicant has been unable to contact a representative from this company.8 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.f \u2013 Medical obligation for about $245. UNPAID. Applicant contacted the \ncompany and gave it her current health insurance information, but has yet to receive \nany documentation concerning the account.9 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.g \u2013 Medical obligation for approximately $149. UNPAID. Applicant \ncontacted the company and gave it her current health insurance information, but has yet \nto receive any documentation concerning the account.10 \n                                            \n   3  Tr. 29. \n \n   4  Tr. 51. \n \n   5  Tr. 52-53. \n \n   6  Ex.

Applicant \nadmitted this debt but does not know what it represents.11 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.j \u2013 Collection account for approximately $283. UNPAID. Applicant only \nadmitted to this account, which she cannot identify, because she wanted to be complete \nin her answers.12 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.k \u2013 Collection account for about $595. UNPAID. Applicant is unable to \nmake payments on this account at this time.13 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.l \u2013 Charged off account for approximately $1,464. IN REPAYMENT \u2013 \nApplicant has been making monthly payments of $50 toward this balance since at least \nAugust 2009.14 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.m \u2013 Charged off account for about $46. UNPAID. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor and was told it had no record of a balance owed. She failed to submit evidence \nto that effect.15 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.n \u2013 Charged off account for approximately $341. UNPAID. Applicant \nstated her contact with this creditor did not culminate in a repayment schedule.16 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.o \u2013 Charged off account for about $3,404. UNPAID. This account is for a \npost-repossession balance on a car which Applicant purchased, but which was in such \ndisrepair she could not use it.17 She admits liability and stated that she made contact \nwith the creditor, but no progress has been made toward paying the balance. \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.p \u2013 Collection account for approximately $180. UNPAID. Applicant failed \nto submit evidence this balance was paid or otherwise resolved.18 \n                                                                                                                                             \n  \n   11 Id. \n \n   12 Id. \n \n   13 Id. at 57. \n \n   14 Ex.

Applicant has no \nknowledge of this creditor.20 \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.s \u2013 Telecommunications collection account for about $1,062. \nRESOLVED. This account balance was included in Applicant 2003 bankruptcy.21  \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.t \u2013 Medical obligation for approximately $2,359. PAID. Department \nCounsel conceded that this account may match evidence submitted as Ex. F, which \nshows a debt handled by the identified collection entity as paid in full. No direct \nevidence was presented linking the account at issue and the evidence presented.22 \nFollowing the hearing, however, Applicant submitted a newer credit report from October \n2009, Ex. J. The account at issue, opened in 2007, is no longer noted. Inasmuch as the \naccount is only about two years old, it is plausible that the account was paid. \n \nAllegation \u00b6 1.u \u2013 Collection account for a retail obligation of about $4,037. UNPAID. \nApplicant believes this account was included in her bankruptcy, but provided no \nevidence of its inclusion.23 \n \nThe SOR also notes, and Applicant admits, that as of April 2009, her monthly \nexpenses exceed her monthly income.24 Applicant also admits that she filed for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy protection in March 2003 and that her debts were discharged in June \n2003.25 Despite the discharge of her unsecured debts, Applicant again found herself in \nfinancial difficulty after purchasing a vehicle she could not afford later that year.26 It has \nsince been replaced by a car donated to her for her use by a local church.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law.

The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing cons\n \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information.

The Appeal Board has stated that \u201c(t)he clearly \nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d41 Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant \nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of \n \n   38 See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 27, 1995). \n \n   41 Id. \n \n   42 Id. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.43 It is \nmerely an indication that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative \nguideline to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case: \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live \nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.44  \n \nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those that would mitigate security \nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged through bankruptcy in 2003. Since that time, \nnewly \nacquired \ndebts \nhave \nalso \nbecome \ndelinquent. \nTherefore, \nFinancial \nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) \napply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case \nagainst her and mitigate security concerns.  \n \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s former debts were discharged through bankruptcy. Since \nthen, Applicant accumulated more delinquent debts because her expenses exceeded \nher income, she lacked medical insurance, and she experienced periods of leave \nwithout pay. Today, her expenses continue to exceed her income, she still lacks \nmedical insurance, and she was on leave without pay for over half of this year due to \nmedical issues. Unless or until Applicant gets a position with health coverage or can \notherwise learn to live within her means, there is no indication that either her current \nfinancial situation will improve or that she will be able to expeditiously address her \ndelinquent debt. Therefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 \n20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) partially applies.  \n \n \nFor several years, the father of Applicant\u2019s older children failed to provide \nfinancial assistance. The location of the father of her youngest children, who provides \nno child support, is unknown. Moreover, health issues forced her to stay home from her \ntemporary position and precluded her from generating income. Therefore, Financial \n                                            \n   43 Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n   44 AG \u00b6 18. \n\n \n9 \n \nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in \nthe behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. \n \nAlthough Applicant received financial counselling, there is no evidence that \ncounseling has helped her resolve her delinquent debts. At most, it motivated her to \nconsider another bankruptcy. Therefore, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control) does not apply. \n \nOf the 21 delinquent debts at issue, Applicant provided evidence that one debt \nhas been paid and one is in repayment. The evidence tends to show that one account \nwas addressed by her 2003 bankruptcy discharge. Remaining unaddressed are 18 \ndebts. While there is testimony regarding attempts to contact or negotiate with creditors, \nno documentary evidence regarding these efforts was submitted. Because some efforts \nhave been exerted to honor these debts, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies to a \nlimited extent.  \n \nApplicant stated that although she admitted all allegations, she cannot identify \nsome of the accounts at issue. Although she may dispute some of these accounts, she \nprovided no evidence that she has formally disputed them with any of the credit \nreporting bureaus and failed to offer any documentation tending to substantiate the \nbasis of her dispute. Consequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue) does not apply. Moreover, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(f) \n(the affluence resulted from a legal source of income) is not applicable. \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve, or at least address, her delinquent debts and her overall financial \ncondition. Today, Applicant continues to expend more than she earns and she is not \neven financially capable of pursuing another bankruptcy filing. She admits that she is \ncurrently \u201cat a standstill\u201d with regard to her finances. Given these circumstances, I am \nnot convinced Applicant\u2019s limited evidence mitigates security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. In reviewing the complete record, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors noted \nabove.  \n \nApplicant is a highly credible young woman. Multiple factors speak in her favor. \nShe has devoted her surplus time and energy to being a good single mother. She \nsuccessfully persevered in both college and graduate school while balancing work and \na growing family. Consequently, Applicant is preparing to transition from \u201ctemp\u201d work to \nmore permanent, professional employment. She renewed her friendship with the father \nof her older children, who recently assumed responsibility for his children. As a result, \nthose children now benefit from the guidance of both parents while Applicant can benefit \nfrom an increase in her available income. Moreover, Applicant no longer maintains \ncontact with the father of her two youngest children, a man she describes as abusive.  \n \n While Applicant must be admired for her academic success in light of her \ngrowing maternal obligations, multiple factors speak against her with regard to her \nfinances. The freedom from debt she received with her 2003 bankruptcy discharge was \nshort lived. A 2003 car purchase immediately put her back on the road to indebtedness. \nRather than temporarily postpone her achievement of a master\u2019s degree and pursue a \npermanent position which offered health insurance, she continued with her \u201ctemp\u201d work \nand acquired more student loan debt and more medical debt. Applicant continued to \naccrue debt and spend more money than she earned for about five years before she \nsought financial counseling. By the time she received such counseling, her debt was \nsuch that she was advised to again seek bankruptcy. She has been less than diligent in \nseeking court-ordered child support. Finally, she failed to submit any additional \ndocuments that could substantiate her efforts on some of the debts at issue despite the \nfact the record was kept open for over two weeks following the hearing. \n \nApplicant has made some progress toward addressing her debt. That progress, \nhowever, has been minimal. She presented no evidence of a budget designed to \naddress her delinquent debt and her approach toward addressing her debt does not \nreflect a coordinated effort. Short of another bankruptcy filing, which she is financially \nunable to complete at this time, Applicant failed to articulate any alternative solutions for \naddressing her debt. In light of these facts, she failed to mitigate security concerns \nregarding her finances. It is worth repeating, however, that an adverse determination \ndoes not speak ill of Applicant or her loyalty. It merely indicates that in presenting her \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ncase, she failed to meet the strict guidelines involved in this process and the standards \nexpected of one seeking a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 5, 2010 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 17, 2011, after the hearing,\n\nAdministrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the\nBoard affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems.  He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2000.  Applicant later requested that the\nbankruptcy action be dismissed after he obtained a job and could cover his debts.  As of 2010, he\nhas an unpaid judgment for rent and has ten collection or charged off accounts which total\napproximately $26,000.  Applicant asserts that he paid his outstanding debts, but he provided no\ndocumentation showing payments.  In August 2008, Applicant completed a security clearance\napplication.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he had been charged with or convicted of a\nfelony offense, even though he had a July 2000 felony conviction.  In his answer to the SOR,\nApplicant stated he did not know he was charged with a felony and was told that all charges had\nbeen dropped and were not on his record.  At the hearing, Applicant gave a different reason for his\n\u201cno\u201d answer.  He stated he thought the question was limited to felony arrests and convictions during\nthe previous seven years only.\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not\nmitigated because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debt.\nHis financial problems are not isolated.  There is no showing that the delinquent debts have been\npaid or resolved, thus the debts are a continuing course of conduct.  Applicant receives partial\nmitigation since his problems were contributed to by an earlier unemployment and having to relocate\nto new states in search of work.  However, he has been employed at his current job since November\n2009 and the debts remain unpaid.  Applicant falsified his response to his security clearance\napplication and that falsification is not mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put\nhis personal needs ahead of legitimate Government interests.\nApplicant argues that the Judge did not look at or take into account all of the documents that\nhe presented in the case.  He states that there were no charged accounts on the date of his hearing,\nand that he had provided a copy of his current credit report that showed his debts had been repaid\nand all other debts were up to date.  Applicant also asserts that his answer to the question on the\nsecurity clearance application was the result of a mistake.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish\nerror on the part of the Judge.  \n \nApplicant relies heavily on an August 2010 credit report that he provided the Judge and that\nwas admitted into evidence.  Applicant states that the credit report establishes his satisfactory\npayment of his outstanding debts.  The Judge specifically mentions the report in his decision, but\nnotes that the mere fact that the report does not contain data on Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts\n(which had been established by two previous credit reports) does not provide proof that the debts\nwere paid.  The Judge requested that Applicant provide additional documentary evidence to\ndemonstrate that the debts had been satisfied, but no additional evidence was forthcoming.  The\nAugust 2010 credit report does not appear to reference the debts listed in the SOR.  Concerning the\ndebts that it does list, with one exception the report indicates that there were no delinquencies or late\n\npayments on any of the accounts for the last seven years.  In light of the other evidence of debt\ndelinquency in the record, the August 2010 credit report appears incomplete at best.  Given these\nfacts, the Judge was not required to accept the report as definitive evidence of Applicant\u2019s\nsatisfaction of his numerous delinquent debts.  \nRegarding Guideline E, Applicant\u2019s explanations as to why he answered the question on the\nsecurity clearance application the way he did was evidence that the Judge was required to consider.\nHowever, the Judge was not required to find Applicant\u2019s explanation credible, particularly in light\nof the fact that Applicant provided differing explanations for his \u201cno\u201d answer.  \nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions\nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at\n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  The Judge provided reasonable explanations for his\nultimate conclusion that Applicant had not mitigated the Government\u2019s case.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nMarch 17, 2011\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on June 5, 2010, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct. \n  \n \nIn an undated response, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn August 12, 2010, I was assigned the case. On August 25, 2010, DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing for the hearing held on Sepember 16, 2010.  \n \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 7, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits \nA through E, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant was given \nto October 1, 2010, to submit additional documentation. No documentation was \nreceived. On September 24, 2010, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nOn August 2, 2010, before the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend \nthe SOR by amending SOR \u00b6 2.a, alleging Applicant falsified his response to the \nquestion in section 23 of his Electronic Questionnaires for National Security Positions \n(e-QIP), dated August 19, 2008. The original SOR stated he had failed to list a felony \narrest and conviction. The amended SOR provides additional information stating he \ndeliberately failed to disclose that he had been arrested on or about December 18, \n1999, and charged with Felony First Degree Forgery and Misdemeanor Taking. In his \nAugust 29, 2010 response to the proposed amendment, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations. At the hearing he did not object to the amendment. (Tr. 16) The motion was \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the factual allegation of the debt \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.a and to filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2000 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. He admitted the factual allegation of SOR \u00b6 2.a as listed in the Amended SOR. He \ndenies the remaining factual allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations \nare incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old computer information security manager who has \nworked for a defense contractor since November 2009, and is seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 46) Applicant received a letter of commendation for his duty \nperformance from February 2008 through December 2008. The letter indicated his \ncommitment was clearly demonstrated, his diligence, resourcefulness, and genuine \npassion for outstanding customer service was noted. (Ex. E) \n \n \nIn May 1993, while on active duty in the U.S. Navy, Applicant wrote three checks \ntotaling over $1,500 on a closed credit union account. (Ex. 4) The credit union informed \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \nhim his account had a negative balance and if he did not deposit sufficient funds his \naccount would be closed. Funds were not supplied and the account was closed. He \nadmitted writing one check after learning the account was closed. He told his \ncommander he had not written the other checks. He told his commander his driver\u2019s \nlicense and some of his checks had been stolen. It was determined he wrote all of the \nchecks. (Ex. 4) Applicant was taken to a special court-martial, convicted, and reduced in \ngrade. In February 1994, Applicant was separated from the Navy with an \u201cother than \nhonorable.\u201d His DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, \nlists the reason as \u201cMisconduct\u2014Absent Without Leave (30 Days or More).\u201d (Ex. B) \nApplicant has asked the Navy to review his discharge. In September 2010, the \ndischarge went before a Navy review board. (Tr. 38) Applicant has not received a \ndecision from the review board.  \n \n \nOn December 18, 1999, Applicant was arrested for forgery \u2013 first degree (a \nfelony) and theft by taking. (Ex. 5) In July 2000, the matter was adjudicated in state \ncourt and he was convicted. Having been found guilty, he had to pay a $300 fine and \nwas sentenced to three years probation. (Id.) His company had a zero tolerance for \nfelonies and he was immediately let go by his company. (Tr. 26)  \n \n \nIn October 2000, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13, Wage Earner\u2019s \nPlan. The plan required $400 monthly payments and was to last five years. (Tr. 26-28) \nHowever, after obtaining a new job, Applicant believed he was making enough money \nto pay his bills without the Chapter 13. He returned to the bankruptcy court and asked \nthat the Chapter 13 be dismissed. (Tr. 27) He was with a company for nine months \nbefore moving from another state to take a job with a large energy company. (Tr. 28) In \nJanuary 2001, when the company went bankrupt, his job ended. (Tr. 28) He returned to \na previous employer and worked for them until June 2004, when he was again laid off. \n(Tr. 28, 29)  \n \n \nApplicant was employed by another employer until September 2008, when he \nmoved to another state for one year to work for a previous employer. (Tr. 29) In 2009, \nhe obtained a job with his present employer, which required him to move to his current \nlocation in another state. (Tr. 29) As of November 2009, Applicant\u2019s annual salary \nincreased from $72,000 to $85,000. (Ex. D) \n \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions, a \nStandard Form (SF) 86. (Ex. 2) He answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23A which asked if he \nhad been charged with or convicted of any felony offense even though he had a July \n2000 felony conviction. In his response to the Amended SOR, he stated he did not know \nhe was charged with a felony and was told all charges had been dropped and were not \non his record. (Amended SOR Answer, Tr. 60) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant gave a different reason for answering \u201cno\u201d to question \n23A. He noted that a number of the questions on the SF 86 limit the scope of the \nquestion to seven years prior to the completion of the questionnaire. (Tr. 30) The \nquestion related to having been charged with or convicted of a felony offense is not so \n\n \n4 \nlimited in scope. Applicant asserted he had no intention to lie to the government, but \nthought the question was limited to the previous seven years and his 1999 felony arrest \nhad occurred more than seven years before completing his 2008 e-QIP. (Tr. 30)  \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant incurred a $4,943 account for schooling (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He \nasserts he paid the debt, but it appeared on his August 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) \n(Ex. 3) and April 2010 CBR (Ex. 7). However, it does not appear on his April 2009 CBR \n(Ex. 4) or his September 2009 CBR (Ex. A).He asserted, but did not document, he \nmade payments every two months on this debt. He asserted he made two payments of \n$1,500 and one of $1,900. (Tr. 33) Applicant was informed of the importance of \nproviding documentation establishing that debts had been paid, were being paid, or \nwere not his debts. (Tr. 37) Applicant asserted he would provide documents following \nthe hearing, related to payment of this debt. (Tr. 37) No information was received. \n \nIn 2000, after losing his job, Applicant could not pay his rent and was evicted. A \n$1,911 judgment was obtained against him for past-due rent. Applicant asserted he had \npaid this judgment and would attempt to get documents showing it has been paid. (Tr. \n39) No documentation was received. \n \nApplicant did not remember the $400 debt (\u00b6 1.e), but believes he had paid it. \n(Tr. 39) He asserted the account for television service (\u00b6 1.f, $128) was in his wife\u2019s \nname and has been paid. (Tr. 41) Applicant maintains utility service with the creditor \nlisted in \u00b6 1.g ($495). (Tr. 42) Applicant does not believe the two bank collection \naccount debts (\u00b6 1.i, $813 and \u00b6 1.f, $740) are his as he was unfamiliar with the names \nof the banks. (Tr. 43) \n \nApplicant owed for cable service. These debts are listed under three separate \naccount numbers and are listed as three separate accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.h, $782; \u00b6 1.j, \n$920; and \u00b6 1.l, $1,058). (Tr. 44) Applicant asserts his cable service account has been \npaid. Another television service account (SOR (\u00b6 1.f, $128) was also placed for \ncollection.  \n \n \nIn 2002 or 2003, Applicant purchased a 1996 Ford Explorer for $20,000. (Tr. 35) \nAfter six or seven months he came to believe the vehicle was a \u201clemon\u201d and hired an \nattorney to assist him with the purchase. (Tr. 34) The vehicle had engine problems, \nelectrical problems, and gave appearances that it had been in a flood. (Tr. 35) \nDiscussions were held between his attorney and the creditor\u2019s attorney. Following the \nadvice of his counsel, Applicant voluntarily returned the vehicle to the creditor. (Tr. 36) \nThis resulted in a $13,834 debt (\u00b6 1.d).  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife attended a two-week debt management course. (Tr. 54) \nHe learned of the importance of establishing a savings account, living within his means, \nand paying his debts. (Tr. 54) He currently has two credit cards which he is using to \nrebuild his credit. He pays off the balance \u201cabout every month.\u201d (Tr. 54) \n\n \n5 \n \nAs of April 2009, Applicant\u2019s current net monthly income was approximately \n$4,000. His monthly expenses were approximately $2,000 and payment of his monthly \ndebts was approximately $1,500. His monthly net remainder (monthly income less \nexpenses and debt payment) was $363. (Ex. 6) Although the personal financial \nstatement lists no income for his spouse, she makes approximately $50,000 per year as \na librarian. (Tr. 46) Applicant and his wife have no children.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 2010 CBR lists no delinquent account or other derogatory \ninformation. (Ex. A) Applicant is current on his monthly $170 student loan payments. \n(Tr. 45) He is current on the $637 monthly payment on the 2006 Toyota Tundra and \ncurrent on the $700 monthly payment on the 2006 Toyota Sequoia. (Tr. 45) He is \ncurrent on his $1,600 monthly mortgage for a home purchased in 2005. The home was \npurchased for $175,000, has a fair market value of $210,000, and approximately \n$150,000 is owed on the home.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n7 \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n8 \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant has an unpaid judgment \nfor rent and has ten collection or charged-off accounts, which totaled approximately \n$26,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n9 \nThe SOR past-due debts do not appear on Applicant\u2019s August 2010 CBR but do \nappear on his August 2008 CBR and March 2010 CBR. He asserts he paid the debts, \nbut provided no documentation showing payments. He was specifically asked to \ndocument the status of the SOR accounts. No documentation was received.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debt. Because \nthere is more than one delinquent debt, his financial problems are not isolated. There is \nno showing the delinquent accounts have been paid or resolved. Therefore, his debts \nare a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). His failure to show proof of payments of these debts casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), he receives partial mitigation because Applicant=s financial \nproblems were contributed to by his unemployment and having to relocate to new states \nin search of work. However, he has been employed at his current job since November \n2009 and the debts remain unpaid.  \n \nApplicant and his wife attended a two-week debt management course where he \nlearned the importance of establishing a savings account, living within his means, and \npaying his debts. He is current on his two credit cards, but there is no documentation \nshowing he has paid any of the SOR debts. It is too early to conclude his financial \nproblems are under control. I find the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 \n20(d) do not apply.  \n \nApplicant has three accounts with the same cable company, asserts they are \nduplications of each other, and asserts he currently has an account with the same cable \ncompany which establishes he does not owe the three debts. The debts all have \ndifferent account numbers and he lived in various states. He did not show he was \ncurrent on his cable account. He failed to establish that all the accounts are the same \nobligation and that the obligations have been paid.  \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 20(e) do not apply. Applicant has disputed a \nnumber of the obligations stating they have been paid or are not his debts. However, for  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) to apply, he must provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue, neither of which he has \ndone.  \n \n \nBecause Applicant was unemployed he filed for bankruptcy protection in 2000. I \ndo not find against him because of this. I find for him as to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 15 articulates the security concerns relating to \npersonal conduct: \n\n \n10 \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 16 is \npotentially applicable: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nIn August 2008, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he failed to indicate he had \na felony arrest in 1999, which resulted in a felony conviction in 2000. His failure to \ndisclose the felony arrest and conviction demonstrates a lack of candor required of \nindividuals seeking a security clearance. The Government has an interest in examining \nall relevant and material adverse information about an Applicant before making a \nclearance decision. The Government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose adverse \ninformation in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or convenient. \nFurther, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about himself provides \nsome indication of his willingness to report inadvertent violations or other concerns in \nthe future, something the Government relies on to perform damage assessments and \nlimit the compromise of sensitive information.  \n \n \nThe event was of such significance that he was fired from his company because \nof its felonious nature. He went to court, paid a $300 fine, and was placed on three \nyears probation. He would have had to take actions in compliance with his probation. \nHe first asserted he did not list it because he did not know it was a felony and was told \nthe charge had been dropped. At hearing, he asserted he failed to list it because it \noccurred more than seven years before he completed the questionnaire. I am not \npersuaded by his reason for failing to reveal the felony.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions related to personal conduct apply. Applicant did \nnot make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts (AG \u00b6 17(a)). The mitigating factors in \nAG \u00b6 17(b) \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or \nlegal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security \nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide \nthe information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully,\u201d does not apply because \nthere was no refusal, failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment caused by \nimproper advice. \n\n \n11 \n \nThe offense Applicant failed to list was a felony. AG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d does not apply. Applicant \nhas not acknowledged the bad behavior nor obtained counseling. AG \u00b6 17(d) \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur\u201d does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(g) \u201cassociation with \npersons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do \nnot cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness \nto comply with rules and regulations,\u201c do not apply. AG \u00b6 17(f) \u201cthe information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability\u201d does not apply because the \nfelony arrest and conviction was substantiated.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of \nlegitimate Government interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant asserts that some of the \ndebts have been paid and others of the debts are not his. However, he failed to \ndocument this. His mere assertion is insufficient evidence to find these obligations have \n\n \n12 \nbeen paid. There is no evidence the delinquent accounts have been paid or are not \nowed. Additionally, he was not truthful when he completed his SF 86. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c\u20131.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. Background Information Applicant is a 37-year-old Arabic linguist, who is employed by a defense contractor and is currently deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Before deploying to Guantanamo Bay, he successfully completed his counterintelligence (CI) screening in September 2010. He seeks a secret security clearance, which is a condition of his continued employment. (GE 1, AE G, Tr. 44, 53, 59, 76.) Applicant\u2019s parents, his two brothers, and three sisters are originally from Jordan. His father was a career noncommissioned officer in the Jordanian Army and 3 his mother was a homemaker. After Applicant\u2019s father retired from the Jordanian Army in 1977, he worked in the private sector. From about 1985, Applicant\u2019s parents made periodic trips to visit Jordanian family members living in the United States. These visits continued until Applicant\u2019s father passed away in September 2000. (GE 3.) Applicant immigrated to the United States in March 1990 when he was 16 years old. His older brother had preceded him in 1987 and was already living in the United States. (GE 3, Tr. 33.) Two reasons prompted Applicant\u2019s family to immigrate to the United States \u2013 (1) as Christians, they were a minority in a predominantly Muslim country; and (2) the rise of extremism in the Middle East.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \n1 Applicant had previously submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on October 6, 2003. (GE \n1.) \nApril 13, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 25, 2010 and answered the Amendment \nto the SOR on August 20, 2010. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nAugust 31, 2010. The case was assigned to me on September 1, 2010. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on September 20, 2010, scheduling the hearing for October 5, \n2010. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 25, 2010.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative \nnotice of certain facts relating to Jordan contained in Ex. I(1-6). Without objection from \nthe Applicant, I took administrative notice of the documents offered by Department \nCounsel, which pertain to Jordan. (Tr. 13-14.) \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known \nor from government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & \nCo. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts \npertaining to Jordan were derived from Ex. I(1-6) as indicated under subheading \n\u201cJordan\u201d of this decision, infra.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a \u2013 1f, and admitted the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1g \u2013 1i. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old Arabic linguist, who is employed by a defense \ncontractor and is currently deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Before deploying to \nGuantanamo Bay, he successfully completed his counterintelligence (CI) screening in \nSeptember 2010. He seeks a secret security clearance, which is a condition of his \ncontinued employment. (GE 1, AE G, Tr. 44, 53, 59, 76.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, his two brothers, and three sisters are originally from \nJordan. His father was a career noncommissioned officer in the Jordanian Army and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis mother was a homemaker. After Applicant\u2019s father retired from the Jordanian Army \nin 1977, he worked in the private sector. From about 1985, Applicant\u2019s parents made \nperiodic trips to visit Jordanian family members living in the United States. These visits \ncontinued until Applicant\u2019s father passed away in September 2000. (GE 3.)  \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in March 1990 when he was 16 years \nold. His older brother had preceded him in 1987 and was already living in the United \nStates. (GE 3, Tr. 33.) Two reasons prompted Applicant\u2019s family to immigrate to the \nUnited States \u2013 (1) as Christians, they were a minority in a predominantly Muslim \ncountry; and (2) the rise of extremism in the Middle East. (Tr. 33-34.) After arriving in \nthe United States, Applicant attended high school and graduated in 1992. He attended \ncommunity college from 1992 to 1995 and was awarded an Associate in Science \ndegree in Automotive Technology. (Tr. -34-35.) After high school, Applicant held part-\ntime and full-time jobs in the restaurant or automotive industry. (GE 1, GE 2.) \n \nIn April 1997, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He served in the Navy from \nApril 1997 to January 2001, and was honorably discharged as an Aviation Structural \nMechanic Safety Equipment Second Class (pay grade E-5). (AE H, Tr. 26-27, 35-36, \n74.) Applicant was in the active Navy reserve from 2002 until 2003, and was in the \ninactive naval reserve from 2003 to 2005. (Tr. 36, 38-39.) Applicant successfully held \na secret security clearance during his Navy service. (Tr. 60.)  \n \nWhile on active duty, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October \n1998, and was issued a U.S. passport in November 1998. (GE 1 \u2013 GE 3.) While on \nactive duty, he continued to earn college credit part-time. After his release from active \nduty, he attended college from September 2001 to December 2002, and was awarded \na Bachelor of Arts degree in History. (GE 1, GE 2, Tr. 37.) He has since completed all \nof his course work for a Master\u2019s Degree in History with a concentration in Islamic \nStudies. (Tr. 43, 73-74.) \n \nApplicant married in June 2002. His wife and her family, like Applicant, were \nfrom Jordan. They divorced in September 2008. Since his divorce, Applicant has not \nhad any contact with his former spouse or her family residing in Jordan. No children \nwere born during this marriage and Applicant has no dependents. Two SOR \nallegations dealt with Applicant\u2019s connections with his former spouse and his mother-\nin-law. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1c and 1d.) In light of Applicant\u2019s divorce and non-contact with his \nformer spouse and her family, these concerns are no longer applicable. (GE 1, GE 2, \nTr. 31-32, 63.) \n \nSince Applicant\u2019s release from active duty, he has held several jobs to include \ntwo terms of employment as an Arabic linguist for defense contractors. From February \n2003 to January 2004, he was employed by a defense contractor to work as an Arabic \nlinguist during the Iraq invasion. He accompanied a U.S. Army unit in Iraq and was \nforward deployed and in harm\u2019s way \u201cmany times.\u201d (GE 2, Tr. 37-40, 70-72.) From \nMarch 2004 to August 2005, he was employed by a defense contractor to work as \nArabic linguist at Guantanamo Bay. His company promoted him to senior linguist and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nproject manager. His new duties required him to travel to Iraq, Kuwait, United Arab \nEmirates, and Qatar. He remained with this company until June 2006 and resigned to \nopen a restaurant and attend school. It was at this time he completed his course work \nfor his Master\u2019s Degree, discussed supra. (Tr. 41-43.) In Iraq, Applicant held a secret \nsecurity clearance, and in Guantanamo Bay, he held a top secret clearance. (Tr. 61.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 62 years old, and she became a naturalized U.S. citizen \nin April 2002. Contrary to what the SOR alleges, she does not live in Jordan, but lives \nin the United States with Applicant\u2019s older brother, discussed infra. (SOR \u00b6 1a.) (GE 2, \nTr. 45.)  \n \nApplicant has a sister (S-1), who is a citizen and resident of Jordan. She retired \nas a major after serving 15 years in the Jordanian Army. (SOR \u00b6 1f.) S-1 applied for \npermanent resident status in the United States in 2003. In July 2010, she came to the \nUnited States for 40 days to establish U.S. residency. During this 40-day period, S-1 \nwas issued her (1) \u201cgreen card,\u201d (2) social security card, and (3) driver\u2019s license. She \nalso applied to sit for the state nursing examination and opened a bank account with a \n$2,500 deposit. She returned to Jordan to close up her affairs and is now living in the \nUnited States. Other than receiving a modest pension for her Jordanian Army service, \nshe is not affiliated with the Jordanian government. (AE D, Tr. 45-46, 64-65.) \n \nApplicant has a sister (S-2), who is a dual citizen of the United States and \nJordan and resides in Jordan. (SOR \u00b6 1g.) S-2 has been employed by a U.S.\u2013based \ncompany since October 2006 and is currently serving as deputy chief of party for a \nU.S. Aid funded project in Jordan. S-2 is attempting to secure a company transfer to \nthe United States. She is not affiliated with or connected to the Jordanian government. \nApplicant has contact with S-2 \u201c[p]robably three times a year, just Easter, Christmas, \nand her birthday, I call her or, send her an e-mail.\u201d (AE C, Tr. 47-49, 65-66.) \n \nApplicant has a sister (S-3), who is a citizen and resident of Jordan. S-3 is \nemployed a high school teacher. (SOR \u00b6 1b.) S-3 is married and her husband (S-3H) \nis also a citizen and resident of Jordan. S-3H is neurosurgeon. S-3, like the rest of her \nsiblings, plans to move to the United States. She completed her application to move to \nthe United States in 2004 and is awaiting further instructions. Apart from S-3 deriving \nher salary from the state, neither S-3 nor S-3H are affiliated with nor do they have any \nconnection with the Jordanian government. Applicant has contact with S-3 \u201cprobably \ntwo, three times a year, max.\u201d (GE 3, Tr. 49-51, 66-67.) \n \nApplicant has two brothers (B-1 and B-2), who are naturalized U.S. citizens and \nresidents of the United States. B-1 is married to a U.S. citizen and has three U.S. \u2013 \nborn children. Applicant\u2019s mother lives with B-1. B-2 is unmarried and has no children. \n(Tr. 51-52.) B-1 supports Applicant\u2019s mother. (Tr. 63.) \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant traveled to Jordan for five family-related visits \nin 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1i.) In 1998, Applicant\u2019s father requested that \nApplicant visit him in Jordan for the purpose of their being baptized. Applicant\u2019s family \n\n \n5 \n \n \npastor in the United States certified that Applicant and his father were baptized on \nAugust 28, 1998 in Amman, Jordan. (AE E, Tr. 54.) In December 1999, Applicant\u2019s \nfather was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Applicant was on active duty at the time and \ntook emergency leave to accompany his father from Jordan to Tel Aviv, Israel for \nmedical treatment. (Tr. 55.) In June 2000, his father\u2019s condition deteriorated and in \nJune 2000, Applicant returned to Tel Aviv to accompany his father home to Jordan \nbecause his father\u2019s condition was \u201chopeless.\u201d (Tr. 56.) \n \nIn May 2001, Applicant returned to Jordan to meet with a woman and her family \nhe had met on a previous trip. They become engaged, married and subsequently \ndivorced, discussed supra. (Tr. 56-57.) In 2008, Applicant and an older brother went to \nJordan to accompany their sister (S-1) to Tel Aviv for medical treatment. She had \nbeen diagnosed with breast cancer and later with leukemia. Applicant and his brother \naccompanied her to Tel Aviv for moral support. (Tr. 57.) Not alleged is a trip that \nApplicant and his older brother made to Jordan in June 2010. They again \naccompanied their sister (S-1) to Tel Aviv for a medical checkup and provide her with \nmoral support. (Tr. 67-68.) \n \nApplicant testified that if he was approached by someone seeking classified or \nsensitive information, he would report that overture to the authorities. The United \nStates is his home. He has no assets in Jordan as opposed to having all of his assets \nin the United States. He owns a home and restaurant business in the United States. \nAll of his bank accounts are in the United States. (AE I, Tr. 52-54, 69-70.) Applicant \ndoes not have any contact with any relatives in Jordan other than the ones mentioned, \nsupra. (Tr. 68.) Applicant is current on all of his state and federal income taxes, \nexercises his right to vote, and enjoys all rights and privileges of being a U.S. citizen. \n(Tr. 75.) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant was awarded an Honor Certificate for attaining the highest scholastic \naverage in his Navy Class \u201cA\u201d School, Aviation Structural Mechanic Safety Equipment \nCommon Core Class A1 in October 1977. (AE A, AE B.) He also submitted an \nOctober 1998 Navy Letter of Commendation, a copy of his Navy Good Conduct \nAward, and a 2000 Navy enlisted performance evaluation reflecting above average \nperformance. (AE F.) \n \nApplicant submitted six personal reference letters to include long-time friends, a \npastor, a neighbor, and a college professor. (AE E.) Applicant also submitted six work-\nrelated reference letters to include former colleagues that worked with him in Iraq and \nat Guantanamo Bay and a former Navy supervisor. (AE F.) These individuals \ncollectively express their full support for Applicant and describe him as a person of \nintegrity, honesty, and compassion. He was awarded two Certificates of Appreciation \nfor his superb performance as an Arabic linguist at Guantanamo Bay. (AE H.) \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nJordan2 \n \nJordan is a small country located in the Middle East with a constitutional \nmonarchy and a developing economy. Jordan is ruled by King Abdullah II, has a \nCouncil of Ministers selected by the King, and has a partially elected bicameral \nNational Assembly. Jordan has followed a pro-Western foreign policy and has had \nclose relations with the United States for six decades. \n \n \nThe State Department notes that Jordan\u2019s human rights record continues to \nreflect some problems. Problems include: torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, \npoor prison conditions, denial of due process, infringement on citizens\u2019 privacy rights, \nand restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association. The United \nNations reports that torture by police and security forces is widespread based on \nconsistent and credible allegations. \n  \n \nJordanian law allows any adult male relative to prevent a woman or child from \nleaving Jordan, even if the woman or child only holds U.S. citizenship. Jordanian law \napplies to dual Jordanian-American citizens. Jordanian law subjects dual citizens to \ncertain obligations, for example, males under the age of 37 are required to register for \nservice in the Jordanian military. Overall, Jordan treats dual citizens as Jordanian \ncitizens under law and may not inform the U.S. embassy if a dual Jordanian-American \ncitizen has a problem in Jordan. \n \n \nDespite Jordan\u2019s aggressive pursuit of terrorists, drafting of counter-terrorism \nlegislation, prosecution of terrorism cases, including both Al-Qaida and non-Al-Qaida \ndefendants, and investigation and disruption of terrorist plots, the threat of terrorism \nremains high in Jordan. Terrorists in Jordan often do not distinguish between U.S. \ngovernment personnel and private citizens and specifically target areas frequented by \nWesterners. \n \n \nIn recent years, the Jordanian security forces disrupted numerous terrorist plots \nagainst U.S. interests. Transnational terrorist groups and local terrorist groups pose \nthreats in Jordan. Specifically, Al-Qaida continues to focus terrorist activities against \nboth the U.S. and Jordan. Al-Qaida claims responsibility for the November 2005 \nbombings of three hotels in Amman, a rocket attack in August 2005, and the \nassassination of an American diplomat in 2002. Jordan\u2019s State Security Court \nconvicted and sentenced three individuals, first to death, but then commuted the \nsentences to 15 years each, for plotting to assassinate President Bush during his \nNovember 2006 trip to Jordan. \n \n \nTerrorist organizations currently target the United States for intelligence \ncollection through human espionage and by other means. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. \n \n2 This section was taken in whole or in part from Ex. I(1-6.) See  Ex. I(1, p. 6-7), Tr. 14.) \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nRelations between the United States and Jordan have been close for six \ndecades, with 2009 marking the 60th anniversary of U.S.\u2013Jordanian ties. A primary \nobjective of U.S. policy has been the achievement of a comprehensive, just and \nlasting peace in the Middle East. U.S. policy seeks to reinforce Jordan\u2019s commitment \nto peace, stability, and moderation. The peace process and Jordan\u2019s opposition to \nterrorism parallel and indirectly assist wider U.S. interests. Accordingly, through \neconomic and military assistance and through close political cooperation, the United \nStates has helped Jordan maintain its stability and prosperity.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a \nclearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the \nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the \nburden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that a relevant security concern exists under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence).  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation \nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire \nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative \nlives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant \nhas periodic contacts with S-2 and S-3, who are citizens and residents of Jordan. \nThese close relationships with his relatives create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions as a result of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members living in Jordan, his \ncontact with them, and his travel to Jordan. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence and prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \n \nTwo Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the U.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies. S-1 was recently granted permanent resident alien \nstatus and now lives in the United States. S-2 is a dual U.S.\u2013Jordanian citizen and \nworks for a U.S.\u2013based company in Jordan. S-2 is seeking a company transfer to the \nUnited States. S-3 has a pending application to move to the United States. With the \nexception of S-1, who receives a modest military pension from Jordan, and S-3, \nwhose teacher salary is derived from Jordan, Applicant\u2019s family members are not \nassociated with or connected with the Jordanian government. On the other hand, \nApplicant has emotional ties with his two siblings living in Jordan as evidenced by his \ncontact with them and visits to Jordan. With regard to his two sisters currently living in \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nJordan, Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of [his sisters] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nHis frequent contacts with his relatives in Jordan could potentially force him to choose \nbetween the United States and Jordan. On balance, he did not fully meet his burden of \nshowing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with sisters] could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen, graduated from \nhigh school in the United States, received all of his higher education in the United \nStates, honorably served in the Navy, and served as an Arabic linguist in Iraq and at \nGuantanamo Bay. He successfully held security clearances in the Navy and during his \ntwo terms of employment with two separate defense contractors. He successfully \ncompleted CI screening and is currently serving as an Arabic linguist at Guantanamo \nBay. Applicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are U.S. citizens and reside in the United \nStates. Most notably, Applicant has been in harm\u2019s way in Iraq having placed his life \non the line accompanying forward deployed Army personnel.  \n \nAppellant has developed a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the United \nStates, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. All of his assets are in the United States. Applicant has been employed by a \ndefense contractor and is very highly regarded at work. Applicant\u2019s contacts and \nlinkage to the U.S. are greater than his linkage to Jordan. He is heavily vested in the \nUnited States -- financially and emotionally. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole-person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole-person concept, \nthe administrative judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d3  \n \nThe directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are used for \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d analysis. Because foreign influence does not involve misconduct, \nvoluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth \nAPF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.4 In addition to the \n \n3 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, \n468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing \nwhen each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth \nAPF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1. Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall commonsense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(c).     \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole-person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to \nthe U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within \nthe U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-\n00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nwhole-person concept analysis. I have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family \nconnections and personal connections to Jordan. Initial concerns regarding his mother \nresiding in Jordan, his spouse being a registered alien from Jordan, his mother-in-law \nbeing a citizen and resident of Jordan, and S-1 being a retired major from the \nJordanian Army have been overtaken by events and are no longer applicable. \nApplicant has two sisters living in Jordan. He has frequent, non-casual contact with his \nsiblings living in Jordan. Applicant traveled to Jordan six times since 1998 for family-\nrelated visits.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen, who has lived in the United States \nsince he was 16 years old or alternatively stated, he has lived in the United States for \nthe last 21 years except when serving overseas. His mother and two brothers are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens residing in the United States. S-1 was granted her \u201cgreen \ncard\u201d and now lives in the United States. S-2 is a dual citizen and seeks a company \ntransfer to the United States. S-3 has a pending application to relocate to the United \nStates.  \n \nMost compelling, however, is the fact that Applicant honorably served in the \nNavy, served two terms of employment as an Arabic linguist, first in harm\u2019s way in Iraq \nand later at Guantanamo Bay, and he is currently serving as an Arabic linguist at \nGuantanamo Bay. During active duty and his terms of service with defense \ncontractors, he has successfully held security clearances and has repeatedly proven \nhimself. \n \nApplicant is financially vested in the United States as a home owner and owner \nof a small business with no financial ties to Jordan. The majority of Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family is in the United States and he maintains a close relationship with \nthem. In short, Applicant\u2019s life is predominantly U.S.-based. His ties to the United \nStates are clearly stronger than his ties to Jordan. There is no evidence that he has \never taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States.   \n \nApr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for \nexploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole-person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s past and present employers have considerable trust in him. His \npersonal and work-related references assess Applicant as loyal, trustworthy, \nconscientious, responsible, mature, and of high integrity. He has an excellent \nreputation as a friend, family member, employee, and U.S. citizen. His evidence \nsupports him for a security clearance. There is no derogatory record information about \nhim. Lastly, Jordan has supported the U.S. war against terrorism and is a country that \nhas been and continues to be friendly with the U.S. for more than 50 years.  \n \nThis case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate \nconcern under the facts presented that the Jordanian government or its agents might \nexploit or attempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in such a way that \nthis U.S. citizen would have to choose between her pledged loyalty to the United \nStates and those family members. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole-person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole-person factors\u201d5 \nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1a \u2013 1i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nDecision \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nRobert J. Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n5See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \n",

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant executed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on March \n11, 2008. He re-signed his SF-86 on June 30, 2008. On July 24, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJanuary 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n \nOn August 26, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 8, \n2009. I convened a hearing on November 9, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced three exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 3 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced five exhibits, which \nwere identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through E. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. I left the record open until November 30, 2009, so that \nApplicant could provide additional information for the record.   \n \nApplicant timely filed six additional documents, which were marked as Ex. F \nthrough K and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) of the hearing on November 18, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 12 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.l.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \neight allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., and 1.l.) He denied four \nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.j.) (SOR; Answer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and employed as a software design engineer by a \ngovernment contractor. In 1995, he received a Bachelor of Science degree. He has \nworked for his present employer for approximately five years. He seeks a security \nclearance for the first time.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 59-63.) \n \n \n  Applicant and his wife have been married for ten years.1  Applicant and his wife \nare the parents of four young children, ages eight, seven, and four.2 Applicant also has \na 20-year-old son, who is a college student. All of Applicant\u2019s children reside with him \nand his wife. (Ex. 1; Tr. 61-62.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $108,000. His wife, who is an attorney, earns \napproximately $90,000 a year. Together, Applicant and his wife have approximately \n$210,000 in student loan debt. The SOR alleges that Applicant is responsible for \ndelinquent consumer and utility debts totaling approximately $550,000, including a \n$384,802 mortgage account that was foreclosed with a past due balance of \napproximately $46,460 (SOR \u00b6 1.i.).  (Ex. 3 at 11; Tr. 57, 144.) \n \n \nApplicant has had financial difficulties since at least 2001, when he and his wife \nwere denied forbearance by a lender holding the mortgage on a rental property they \n \n1 At his hearing, Applicant stated he had been married for 14 years. On his SF-86, Applicant listed his \nwedding date as July 2, 1999. (Ex. 1; Tr. 61.)  \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s youngest children are four-year-old fraternal twins. (Tr. 62.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nowned. To avoid foreclosure on the property, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in October 2001. Their Chapter 13 plan was confirmed in February 2002. \nApplicant and his wife converted the Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nin November 2002, and the bankruptcy court discharged their debts in February 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.l.  (Ex. 2 at 7, 8, 9, 18-19; Ex. 3 at 4.) \n \n \nIn 1998 or 1999, Applicant and his wife purchased a home for $269,000. Their \nmonthly mortgage payments were approximately $1,700 a month. In 2005, Applicant \nrefinanced the property in order to make some improvements to the property and to pay \noff some debts. The new mortgage, an adjustable rate mortgage, was for $384,802. His   \nmortgage payments on the refinanced loan rose to approximately $3,500 a month. His \nwife became pregnant with twins and was unable to work. In 2006, Applicant fell behind \non his mortgage payments.  Applicant tried to work out a restructuring arrangement with \nthe lender, but was unable to do so. The property went into foreclosure in October 2007. \nAt the time of his hearing, Applicant had not been in contact with the mortgage company \nfor several months and did not know if the property had been sold. The debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. remained unresolved.  (Ex. 2 at 29, 33; Tr. 32, 51-52, 115-119.)     \n \n  \nWhen Applicant refinanced his home in 2005, he also took out a second real \nestate mortgage for $100,000 in order to purchase rental properties in another state. \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.g. that the $100,000 mortgage account had become delinquent, \nhad been placed for collection, and was not paid as of February 9, 2009. At his hearing, \nApplicant stated that he had offered to pay the creditor $500 a month on the debt, but \nthe creditor wanted a one-time payment of $30,000 to settle the debt. Applicant lacked \nthe money to pay the lump sum demanded by the creditor. Instead, he sent the creditor \na check for $250, which was not accepted. The debt has not been settled or paid. (Ex. \n2, 49-51; Tr. 33-34, 100-114.) \n \n \nAlso in 2005, when he refinanced his home, Applicant took out a home equity \nloan from a credit union for approximately $25,000. He planned to use the proceeds to \nmake home improvements. Applicant became delinquent on the loan. The SOR alleged \nat \u00b6 1.b. that the creditor had obtained a judgment on the debt in 2008 for approximately \n$26,386, and, as of February 2009, the judgment had not been satisfied. At his hearing, \nApplicant stated that he had contacted the creditor in about March 2009 to arrange \npayment of the debt. Applicant and the creditor agreed that he would pay $250 a month \nto satisfy the debt. Applicant made one payment in March 2009. Then, because he was \nbehind on his payments on an automobile loan with the same creditor, he discontinued \nhis home equity payments for several months and, instead, made payments on his \ndelinquent auto loan. Applicant later resumed his home equity loan payments, and he \nestimated that he had made four payments of $250 on the debt. (Tr. 39, 74-80.) \n \n \nApplicant denied the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j because he believed it was a \nduplicate of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. He stated that he would provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his assertion that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.j alleged the same \ndebt. In a post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that he had requested but had not \n\n \n4 \n \n \nreceived confirmation from the creditor that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j. was a \nduplicate of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b.   (Ex. G; Tr. 52-53, 78.) \n \n    \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.a. that Applicant owed $378 on a medical account that \nwas in collection status and which had not been paid as of February 9, 2009. In his \nanswer to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant denied the debt and acknowledged \nthat it had not been paid. He stated that he had asked the creditor to provide him with \ndocumentation to validate the debt as his, but the creditor had failed to do so. He also \nstated that he had disputed the debt with the credit reporting agencies after receiving \nthe SOR in July or August 2009. The debt appears on the February 2009 credit report \nthat Applicant provided to DOHA in response to interrogatories. Applicant \nacknowledged that he sometimes set aside invoices associated with his children\u2019s \nmedical care for future payment. He acknowledged that he paid the invoices \u201cthe \nmajority of the time.\u201d He provided no documents to corroborate that he had disputed the \ndebt. (Ex. 2 at 22; Tr. 38-39, 67-73.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied a $70 debt, in collection status, \nalleged at \u00b6 1.c. The debt is listed on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report of July 29, 2008.  \nApplicant also denied the debt at his hearing. He acknowledged that the debt was for a \nreturned check, but he thought he had paid the debt. In a post-hearing submission, \nApplicant offered a transaction receipt from his on-line banking account, dated \nNovember 28, 2009, showing payment of $83.75 to the creditor. The transaction receipt \nalso showed that Applicant had an available balance in the account of $32.13. (Ex. 3 at \n5; Ex. I; Tr. 44, 80-83.) \n \n \nApplicant denied a $352 debt, in collection status, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. He \nstated that he had disputed the debt, and it had been removed from his credit bureau \nreport in about 2007. He cited a February 25, 2009, letter from the creditor in the record \nas evidence that the debt had been removed from his credit report. However, the letter \ndid not inform Applicant that the account had been removed from his credit report. \nInstead, the letter informed him that the $352 debt had been sold to a successor \ncreditor and advised Applicant to contact the successor creditor to arrange payment of \nthe debt.  (Ex. 2 at 10; Tr. 44-45, 83-88.) \n \n \nAs a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided a letter from the successor \ncreditor, dated November 27, 2009, offering to settle the debt for $176.45. Applicant \nprovided further documentation to show that he intended to settle the debt on December \n24, 2009. (Ex. G; Ex. J.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted a $5,042 debt in collection status, which was alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 1.e. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor, who had given Applicant notice of court action to resolve the debt.  However, at \nhis hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he and the creditor had a disagreement about \npayment plan procedures, and he had stopped making payments under the payment \nplan. The debt has not been satisfied. (Ex. 2 at 13-15; Tr. 88-96.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.f. that Applicant owed a $1,079 debt, in collection status, \nand the debt had not been paid as of February 9, 2009. In his answer to the SOR and in \ndirect testimony at his hearing, Applicant stated that he and the creditor had entered \ninto an agreement whereby Applicant would pay $539 to settle the debt. Applicant \nfurther stated that the creditor had made a subsequent settlement demand, and he and \nthe creditor were renegotiating the terms of the settlement. However, in cross- \nexamination, Applicant asserted that the account was paid in full. He stated he did not \nhave receipts to corroborate payment. In a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided \na document, dated November 13, 2009, from the creditor stating that it would agree to a \nsettlement amount of $730, provided it was paid no later than November 27, 2009. (Ex. \nK; Ex. 2 at 11; Tr. 47, 96-100.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.h. that Applicant owed a $171 debt, in collection status, \nand the debt had not been paid as of February 9, 2009. Applicant admitted the debt and \nstated he had not paid it because he was waiting for the creditor to provide him with an \ninvoice validating the debt. In his answer to the SOR, he stated he would pay the debt if \nhe received an invoice from the creditor. Applicant contacted the creditor once in about \nFebruary 2009 and requested that the creditor provide him with an invoice. Applicant did \nnot follow up on his request and had no further contact with the creditor. The debt has \nnot been paid, and Applicant did not provide a copy of documentation that he sent to the \ncreditor. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 50, 114-115.) \n \n  \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.k. that Applicant owed $4,499 on an account that was in \ncollection status, and, as of February 9, 2009, the account had not been satisfied. \nApplicant admitted the debt and stated that he had a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor that was current.  At his hearing, Applicant stated that the debt was charged off. \nHe identified it further as a credit card debt.  He said the creditor told him it would not \nenforce the debt since he was paying on two other debts owed to that creditor. (Answer \nto SOR; Tr. 121-123.)    \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary is $6,254, and his wife\u2019s net monthly salary is \napproximately $5,076, for a combined net monthly income of approximately $11,330. \nTheir total monthly household expenses total $7,808.  In addition, Applicant and his wife \npay approximately $950 on their automobile and student loan debts. Their net monthly \nremainder is $2,572. (Ex. 2 at 46; Ex. B; Tr. 148-169.) \n \nApplicant has approximately $26,680 in his 401K plan.  His stocks and bonds \ntotal approximately $200. His checking account balance is about $400. (Tr. 169-172.) \n \nApplicant and his wife received some financial advice and counseling when they \nfiled for bankruptcy in 2001 and 2002. They have not had consumer credit counseling, \nand they do not have a financial advisor. (Tr. 173-174.) \n \nIn 2009, Applicant acquired a second job that lasted for about one month. He \ngave up the second job because his wife needed his help in caring for their children. (Tr. \n174.)  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n                                                  Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n7 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are ongoing and date at least to 2001 and 2002, \nwhen he and his wife declared bankruptcy to avoid foreclosure when they fell behind on \ntheir mortgage payments on a rental property. In 2003, their debts were discharged in a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. In 2005, they refinanced the mortgage on their residence, and \nApplicant used some of the proceeds to purchase investment property in another state. \nApplicant and his wife suffered some loss of income when his wife became pregnant, \nand she was unable to work outside the home. When the payments under Applicant\u2019s \nadjustable rate mortgage rose, he fell behind in his payments. Eventually, the mortgage \nwent into foreclosure in 2007. While Applicant was affected by the downturn in the real \nestate market and was subject to events beyond his control, he also elected to incur \nadditional debt by purchasing real property as an investment when he had difficulty \nmeeting his existing financial obligations. This was not responsible conduct under the \ncircumstances.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage payments and investment expenditures, in addition to his \nmonthly fixed expenses and consumer debt payments, caused him to become \nfinancially overextended. The $46,460 mortgage debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i. remains \nunsatisfied. Moreover, Applicant demonstrated that he had satisfied only one of the ten \nadditional debts alleged in the SOR. He hopes to pay his creditors at a later time, but \nhis current financial situation casts doubt on his ability to plan realistically for the future. \n \nTo his credit, Applicant made attempts to clarify and resolve some of his debts. I \nconclude that the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. was not established by the \nGovernment. Additionally, Applicant consistently denied the debt and acted reasonably \nto seek documentation showing that he owed the debt. I also conclude SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and \n1.j are duplicative and allege the same debt.    \n \nApplicant received some financial advice before he decided to file for bankruptcy \nin 2001 and 2002, but he has not received consumer credit counseling. While he \nadmitted his financial delinquencies, it was not clear that he understood his financial \nproblems or how to resolve them. He has no plan in place to systematically resolve his \nsubstantial delinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that none of \nthe Financial Considerations mitigating conditions fully applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 37 \nyears. He has worked for his present employer for five years. He is dedicated to his \nfamily. \n \nHowever, his financial problems date to at least 2002, when he filed for \nbankruptcy. In 2003, he was granted a discharge in bankruptcy and thereby acquired a \nfresh start in his financial life. While he received some financial counseling as a part of \nhis bankruptcy, he failed to apply that knowledge. His lack of attention to his financial \ndelinquencies continues to raise security concerns.  \n \nApplicant has failed to meet his financial obligations. He has a $46,000 mortgage \ndebt that is unresolved. He owes $100,000 on a delinquent second mortgage account \nand $25,000 on a delinquent home equity loan. While he reports a substantial monthly \nnet remainder, he has not used his existing financial resources to pay his creditors. His \nfinancial situation remains precarious. He lacks a realistic plan to satisfy his financial \nobligations, raising concerns about his judgment and potential financial vulnerability. \n \nApplicant may find it beneficial to seek professional financial counseling and legal \nadvice about resolving his debts and acquiring financial stability in the near term. \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date of this decision if \nhis employer will sponsor him. At that time, he can produce new evidence that \naddresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I \nconclude, after a careful review of the facts of his case, the Financial Considerations \nadjudicative guideline, and the whole person analysis, that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his financial delinquencies.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:   \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:                       Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:                        For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. \u2013 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. \u2013 1.l.:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n                                   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 13, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on April 1, 2008.  (Government 1.)  On June 22, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H and E for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 17, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on September 2, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 15,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for November 17, 2009.  The Government presented four\nexhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 4, which were admitted without objection.\nThe Applicant presented seven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G,\nwhich were admitted without objection.  The Applicant also testified on his own behalf.\n\n2\nThe official transcript (Tr.) was received on December 1, 2009.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 51 years old and married with three children.  He is employed by\na defense contractor as a Computer Network Administrator, and is applying for a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.)  He used marijuana intermittently and at various\nfrequencies from 1978 to 1981, on a daily basis; in 1987, on three occasions; from 2001\nto 2002, every other day; and in 2003, on two occasions.     \nThe Applicant began using and purchasing marijuana about the time he joined\nthe United States Air Force in 1978.  He served twenty-one years on active duty before\nretiring as a Master Sergeant in 1999, with an honorable discharge.  During his military\ncareer, the Applicant held a security clearance and used marijuana off and on.  He used\nit socially and enjoyed its effects.  He testified that although it was prohibited, illegal\ndrug use was quite prevalent in the military during the post-Vietnam era.  He was still\nable to maintain a high performance level.  (Tr. pp. 32-34.)  \nIn February 1980, he was charged with Felony Possession of Marijuana.\nApplicant testified that he got picked up for having two ounces of marijuana.  He spent\nthe night in jail.  His first sergeant came and picked him up and took him to a lawyer,\nwho was a reservist.  The lawyer took him downtown to talk to the judge, and then back\nto the base to handle the military matter.  He received eighteen months probation as\npart of a pre-trial diversion program. The military sent him to a drug rehabilitation\nprogram and he was subject to drug testing.  He received no other disciplinary action for\nhis conduct.  Following this charge, the Applicant continued to perform well and get\npromoted as he continued to use marijuana.  \nFrom 1979 to 1980, he also experimented with a variety of other illegal drugs,\nincluding cocaine, LSD, hashish, quaaludes and speed.  However, marijuana was his\ndrug of choice.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  \n \nIn 1999, after separating from the Air Force, he lived next door to a neighbor who\nsold marijuana out of his house.  The Applicant started purchasing it and using it again.\nFrom October 2001 to June 2002, he used marijuana every other day and it started\nnegatively affecting his job performance.  (Tr. pp. 38 and 40.)  During this period, the\nApplicant testified that his marijuana use, \u201ccost him his job\u201d.  He lost everything,\n\n3\nincluding his house, furniture, car and motorcycles.  He was forced to file bankruptcy.\n(Tr. p. 25.) \nIn August 2003, he used marijuana two times.  He testified that during his\nvacation, he met up with an old friend and used marijuana with him.  (Tr. p. 41.)  Since\nthen, the Applicant has not used any illegal drugs and has no intentions of ever doing so\nagain.  He is active in his church three days a week, teaches Sunday school and no\nlonger associates with individuals who use marijuana or any illegal drug.  (Tr. p. 42.)\nThe Applicant signed a letter of intent promising that he will not be involved in the use,\npossession or sale of any illegal drugs in the future, and if he is, his security clearance\nwill be subject to immediate revocation.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.  The Applicant\nadmitted with explanations the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  \nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated March 31, 2008.  Question 24 of the application asked the\nApplicant, if since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, has he\nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, etc.  The\nApplicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  This was a false answer.  The\nApplicant failed to disclose his more recent use of marijuana from October 2001 to June\n2002, and his use in August 2003.  (Government Exhibit 2.)   \nQuestion 23(d) of the same application asked the Applicant if he has ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO\u201d.  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose his charge\nfor Felony Possession of Marijuana in February 1980.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  The\nApplicant explained that the incident occurred twenty-nine years ago, when he was\nyoung and in the military at the time, and he did not realize that it was a Felony.  (Tr. p.\n23.)    \nQuestion 24(b) of the same application asked the Applicant if he has ever used a\ncontrolled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or\ncourtroom official; while in possession of a security clearance; or while in a position\ndirectly or immediately affecting public safety?  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.\n(Government Exhibit 1.)  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose his\nuse of marijuana from 1978 to 1981, while in the military and holding a security\nclearance.\nThe Applicant admitted that he attempted to conceal his most recent marijuana\nuse from October 2001 to June 2002 and in August 2003, because he was fearful of\nlosing everything all over again.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  He was scared and to protect\nhimself and his family, he lied on the application.  (Tr. p. 43.)  Since he got away with it\nin the military he figured he could get away with it now.  He now realizes his foolishness,\nhe regrets his actions, and is very ashamed and remorseful.  He understands that he\n\n4\nshould have been truthful with the Government in response to the questions and states\nthat he has learned a harsh lesson from his mistakes.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, coworkers\nand pastor indicate collectively that the Applicant is well respected.  He is considered\nprofessional, reliable, truthful, trustworthy, religious, and loyal.  He is said to have\nlearned from his past mistakes.  He is known to be dedicated to the proper safeguarding\nof sensitive national security information and recommended for a position of trust.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, D, E, F and G.)     \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n25.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n5\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\n\n6\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H) and that he falsified his\nsecurity clearance application (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H and E of the SOR.  The evidence shows that\nthe Applicant used marijuana intermittently, and at times on a daily basis, from 1978 to\nat least 2003.  Applicant used marijuana while serving in the United States Air Force,\nand while holding a security clearance, namely in a public position of trust.  He used\nmarijuana knowing that it was prohibited by law and clearly prohibited by the\nDepartment of Defense.  This misconduct is criminal, blatantly egregious and reckless,\nand demonstrates unreliability and untrustworthiness.  Despite the fact that his most\nrecent use of marijuana occurred in 2003, seven years ago, his marijuana use spans a\ntwenty-five year period.  This long history of marijuana use  includes short periods of\nabstinence followed by drug use.  Given this history, the Applicant has failed to provide\npersuasive evidence that he has once and for all put his illegal drugs use behind him.\n\n7\nUnder the particular facts of this case, his use of marijuana is considered a significant\nsecurity risk, which prohibits a favorable determination in this case.       \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 25(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  I find his past use of marijuana to be of security significance.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nWith respect to the Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his drug involvement and his\nfelony charge for possession of marijuana on his security clearance application, I find\nthat it was intentional.  There is no other plausible explanation for his conduct.\nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16(a) deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the\nApplicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application by concealing his illegal\ndrug involvement.  Consequently, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 51 years old, and a late\nbloomer in terms of reaching maturity.  I have considered all of the evidence.  The fact\nremains, however, that he abused marijuana while serving in the military and while\nholding a security clearance.  Furthermore, he was not candid in response to questions\nconcerning his marijuana use and did not disclose this felony drug related charge on his\nsecurity clearance application.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the\nconduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person\nassessment of poor judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 23, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.1 On \nMay 21, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, \n \n1  FORM Item 7. \n \nDecember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nand revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn June 5, 2009, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations. \nShe elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 6). \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated July 16, 2009, was \nprovided to her by letter dated July 20, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on August \n5, 2009. She was afforded a period of 30 days to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit any material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation in response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 8, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.g, 1.i, 1.l, 1.n, \n1.o, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.v. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.p, 1.q, 1.t, and 1.u. \nHer admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of \nthe evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old physical security guard. She has been working for her \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since August 2005.3 She graduated from high \nschool in 1998, and attended college from November 1999 to January 2000. She has \nnot completed a degree. Applicant has never been married and disclosed no children.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history can be summarized as follows: she has been employed \nsince December 1997 to present, except during the following unemployed periods: from \nAugust 1999 to August 2001, from July 2002 to December 2002, and from July 2003 to \nNovember 2003. Applicant has been consistently employed from November 2003 to \npresent. It appears that she has been holding two jobs since December 2002. She was \nhired by her current employer, a defense contractor, in August 2005.  \n \nIn her 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having financial \nproblems, i.e., debts over 180 days delinquent during the last seven years, and \ncurrently having debts over 90 days delinquent. Applicant\u2019s background investigation \naddressed her financial problems and included the review of her May 2009 and August \n2008 credit bureau reports (CBRs), and her answers to March 2009 DOHA \ninterrogatories.  \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) directed application of revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. \n1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 7 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent and/or charged-off accounts totaling \napproximately $28,000. Applicant admitted 12 of the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR, totaling approximately $10,700. She claimed she has established payment plans \non three of the SOR debts; however, she presented no documentary evidence to \ncorroborate her claims. Applicant denied 10 of the SOR delinquent debts, totaling \napproximately $17,000.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m both allege Applicant had judgments filed against her in \n2006 and 2007, respectively. Applicant claimed she was unaware of them. Concerning \nthe other SOR debts Applicant denied, she claimed some were her sister\u2019s debts, \nothers she did not recall or was not aware the debts had become delinquent. She \nprovided no other explanations as to why these debts were not valid. She provided no \ndocumentary evidence to show that she has formally disputed any of the debts she \ndenied. \n \nI find that the alleged delinquent debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand her two credit reports (Items 9 and 10).4 Most of the debts have been delinquent for \nmany years. Nine of the delinquent debts involved relatively small debts, for less than \n$500 each. In light of her financial history, Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements are \nnot sufficient to show that she contacted creditors, settled debts, or has been making \npayments on her debts. Applicant failed to overcome the presumption established by \nthe credit reports that these are her debts.  \n \nApplicant explained her financial problems were the result of her attempts to \nfinish college while working low-paying jobs. She was spending more money for school \nthan what she was earning. Her periods of unemployment also contributed to her \nfinancial problems. Overall, she did not have sufficient income to pay her day-to-day \nliving expenses and her delinquent obligations. In her September 2008 statement to a \ngovernment investigator, Applicant stated she was meeting her current financial \nobligations, but, could not afford to pay her old delinquent accounts. According to her \nMarch 2009, response to interrogatories, Applicant\u2019s gross monthly salary was \napproximately $1,066, and her monthly expenses were $500. \n \nApplicant has not participated in financial counseling. She indicated she has \nmade inquiries about how to consolidate her debts. Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence showing any efforts to consolidate her debts. Overall, Applicant \npresented little evidence of paid debts, settlement agreements, or efforts to resolve her \ndelinquent debts since she acquired them.  \n \n4  An applicant\u2019s credit report showing the delinquent debts alleged in an SOR is sufficient to \nestablish the government\u2019s prima facie case. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2003). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \n \n5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6  \u201c \u201c\u201dThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has accumulated 22 delinquent and/or charged-off accounts totaling \napproximately $28,000, most of which have been outstanding for many years. Applicant \nadmitted 12 of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, totaling approximately $10,700. \nShe claimed she has established payment plans on three of the SOR debts; however, \nshe presented no documentary evidence to corroborate her claim. Applicant denied 10 \nof the SOR delinquent debts, totaling approximately $17,000.7 She presented no \ndocumentary evidence to overcome the presumption these are her debts. She \npresented no documentary evidence of efforts to pay or resolve any of the financial \nobligations alleged in the SOR.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n7  Applicant failed to admit or deny SOR \u00b6 1.e, and I considered it denied. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. Her financial problems are ongoing and her evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence to establish circumstances beyond her \ncontrol contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., her periods of unemployment. \nApplicant presented little evidence of efforts to resolve her financial obligations since \nshe acquired the debts. She has failed to pay two judgments or to formally dispute her \ndelinquent debts. Applicant presented no corroborating documentary evidence of efforts \nto pay or resolve any of the financial obligations alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant has been employed since December 1997 to present, except during \nthe following unemployed periods: from August 1999 to August 2001, from July 2002 to \nDecember 2002, and from July 2003 to November 2003. Applicant has been \nconsistently employed from November 2003 to present. It also appears that she has \nbeen holding two jobs since December 2002. She was hired by her current employer, a \ndefense contractor, in August 2005. Notwithstanding her periods of unemployment, \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to revolve her financial \nobligations. Her favorable information fails to establish a track record of financial \nresponsibility. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there are no clear indications that her \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. She presented no evidence that \nshe has received financial counseling. Considering the number of delinquent debts, the \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndate the debts were acquired, the aggregate value of the debts, and the lack of \ncorroborating documentary evidence of efforts to resolve her legal financial obligations, \nApplicant\u2019s information is insufficient to establish that her financial problems are unlikely \nto recur. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the facts in \nthis case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for her \nwork history and years working for government contractors. She also receives credit for \nher efforts to complete her college education and some mitigation because of her \nextensive periods of unemployment. These factors show some responsibility and \nmitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. Applicant has failed to show good-faith efforts to \nresolve her financial problems in a timely manner.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She graduated from college in August 2006, attended graduate school from August 2007 to May 2008, and began employment with her current employer in June 2008. Her current job is her first job after college (Tr. 56). She has never held a security clearance. Applicant was born in Italy while her father, a U.S. Air Force officer, was stationed there. Her mother is a native of Italy who became a U.S. citizen in June 1999. Her father was reassigned to the U.S. when she was about one year old, and they lived in the U.S. for two years. Her father was again assigned to Italy when she was three years old. She attended an Italian school because there were no U.S. schools near her father\u2019s duty station. When she was eight years old, her father returned to the U.S. because the Air Force Base where he worked was closed. Applicant and her mother remained in Italy so that she could finish elementary school. In 1995, when Applicant was ten years old, she and her mother returned to the U.S., where she has lived continuously until the present (Tr. 30-31). Applicant\u2019s mother registered her with the Italian \u201cRegistry of Citizens Living Abroad\u201d in 1995, when they returned to the U.S. (Tr. 32).

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 25, 2008. On May \n21, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline C. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on June 8, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on June 30, 2009, and the case was \nAugust 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nassigned to me on July 9, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 14, 2009, \nscheduling the hearing for July 31, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf. The record closed upon adjournment of the \nhearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 5, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She graduated from \ncollege in August 2006, attended graduate school from August 2007 to May 2008, and \nbegan employment with her current employer in June 2008. Her current job is her first \njob after college (Tr. 56). She has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Italy while her father, a U.S. Air Force officer, was \nstationed there. Her mother is a native of Italy who became a U.S. citizen in June 1999. \nHer father was reassigned to the U.S. when she was about one year old, and they lived \nin the U.S. for two years. Her father was again assigned to Italy when she was three \nyears old. She attended an Italian school because there were no U.S. schools near her \nfather\u2019s duty station. When she was eight years old, her father returned to the U.S. \nbecause the Air Force Base where he worked was closed. Applicant and her mother \nremained in Italy so that she could finish elementary school. In 1995, when Applicant \nwas ten years old, she and her mother returned to the U.S., where she has lived \ncontinuously until the present (Tr. 30-31).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother registered her with the Italian \u201cRegistry of Citizens Living \nAbroad\u201d in 1995, when they returned to the U.S. (Tr. 32). At the hearing, Applicant was \nasked if she still felt an obligation to update the registry, and she responded: \u201cI guess \nso. I mean, I\u2019m not sure what \u2013 what happens if I don\u2019t.\u201d (Tr. 49.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother obtained an Italian passport for her in May 1999, when she \nwas 14 years old, and she used it when she and her mother traveled to Italy. Her \nmother obtained the Italian passport because she did not want them to be separated \nwhen traveling through customs and immigration (GX 2 at 17). The passport expired in \nMay 2004. Applicant has not destroyed or surrendered it, but she has not renewed it. \nShe obtained a U.S. passport in September 2007. \n \nApplicant has not voted in any Italian elections and does not intend to (Tr. 32). \nShe does not intend to return to Italy, except to visit relatives, and she intends to live \nand work in the U.S.  \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator on October 20, 2008, Applicant \nmade several statements that raised security concerns. According to the investigator\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsummary of the interview, she intended to renew her Italian passport and hold \ncitizenship in both countries, she felt allegiance to both countries, she did not know \nwhere her allegiance lies and did not know if she could pick a side, her allegiance or \nobligation was fifty percent to Italy and fifty percent to the U.S., and she would not \nrelinquish her Italian passport (GX 2 at 16-17).  \n \nApplicant testified she found the security investigator \u201ca little bit intimidating\u201d and \nshe believes she misunderstood some of his questions (Tr. 33). The investigator was \nolder, about the age of her father. She testified he was appropriately dressed and acted \nprofessionally (Tr. 54-55).  \n \nApplicant admitted telling the investigator she planned to renew her Italian \npassport. She changed her mind after being advised that possession of two passports \nwould be an impediment to having a clearance (Tr. 43). She used her U.S. passport \nwhen she traveled to Italy to visit family members from July 16 through July 24, 2009, a \nweek before the hearing (Tr. 39). \n \nRegarding the statement in the interview summary that she feels allegiance to \nboth countries, she testified, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I actually said I don\u2019t know where my \nallegiance lies, but I did say I identify with both countries, so maybe that\u2019s what started \nthis misunderstanding.\u201d She explained that her heritage is from Italy as well as the U.S. \n(Tr. 43-44).  \n \nRegarding the statement that she does not know if she could pick a side, she \ntestified the investigator was pushy, trying to prompt her, and asking, \u201cWhich one would \nyou pick, which one would you pick,\u201d and she responded that she did not know. She \ntestified she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what he meant allegiance-wise, which side would you \npick, because he just said which side would you pick.\u201d She testified, \u201cI want to clarify \nthat my allegiance is with the United States.\u201d She stated: \u201cI don\u2019t really have any \nallegiance ties to Italy. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s my culture, so it\u2019s my heritage, but as far as \nallegiance, it would be with the United States, because I spent much more time here \nthan Italy.\u201d She testified she does not intend to move back to Italy (Tr. 44-46). She \ndenied saying that her allegiance to the two countries was fifty percent to Italy and fifty \npercent to the U.S. (Tr. 47). \n \nApplicant admitted telling the security investigator she was not willing to \nrenounce her Italian citizenship (Tr. 50). She explained that she had just started her \nnew job and was unfamiliar with the requirements for obtaining a security clearance. \nShe testified, \u201cIf it\u2019s something that I absolutely have to do, then I\u2019ll definitely think about \nthat.\u201d  \n \nOn further questioning about her willingness to renounce her Italian citizenship, \nApplicant testified: \u201cI think if I had to, then I would do it. I\u2019ve been \u2013 it\u2019s something that \nI\u2019ve been thinking about ever since this happened, because I was not aware of \ncitizenship and passport requirements for a security clearance when the interview with \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe investigator took place.\u201d (Tr. 56.) In her closing statement she said, \u201cI believe that if I \nhad to renounce my Italian citizenship that I would do so.\u201d (Tr. 68.) \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories on March 9, 2009, Applicant stated she had \nnot made a decision on renewing her Italian passport and she had received conflicting \ninformation from a website and a DOHA personnel security specialist about the \nimplications of having an Italian passport (GX 2 at 2). She also stated she was not \nwilling to perform military service or bear arms for Italy (GX 2 at 10).  \n \nIn the same set of interrogatories, Applicant authenticated the personnel subject \ninterview summary prepared by the security investigator who interviewed her in October \n2008. She made several corrections, but none of them pertained to the comments about \nher allegiance to the U.S. and Italy (GX 2 at 13).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant told an investigator she was unsure of where her \nallegiance lies, she did not know if she could pick a side between Italy and the U.S., and \nshe had family in both countries and identified with both countries (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also \nalleges she received an Italian passport in 1999 that expired in 2004, and she used it in \nJune 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It further alleges that she registered as an Italian citizen with \nthe Italian Registry of Citizens Living Abroad (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline C is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a \nway as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or \nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. Dual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient \nto warrant an adverse security clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 \nWL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an \napplicant is a dual national, but rather whether an applicant shows a preference for a \nforeign country through actions.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, \n1999). \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, \neven for a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might \n\n \n6 \n \n \npose a challenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, \n2009). \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may arise from \u201cexercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n10(a). This disqualifying condition includes but is not limited to \u201cpossession of a current \nforeign passport\u201d and \u201caccepting education, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and (3). Although not an \nenumerated disqualifying condition, AG \u00b6 10(a) would encompass Applicant\u2019s \ncompliance with the obligation of registering as an Italian citizen living abroad and \nupdating that registry. A disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201cany statement or \naction that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(d). \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(1) is not raised because Applicant\u2019s Italian passport is expired, but \nher use of her Italian passport in June 1999 raises the general disqualifying condition in \nAG \u00b6 10(a). Her acceptance of Italian educational benefits raises AG \u00b6 10(a)(3). Her \nstatements to the security investigator in October 2008 raise AG \u00b6 10(d). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a) and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). This mitigating condition is applicable, because Applicant\u2019s Italian citizenship is \nbased on the citizenship of her mother and her birth in Italy. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). Applicant\u2019s \nattitude toward renouncing her Italian citizenship has changed as she has learned more \nabout the security implications of dual citizenship. In October 2008, she told an \ninvestigator she was unwilling to relinquish her Italian citizenship and intended to renew \nher Italian passport. In March 2009, she answered DOHA interrogatories by stating she \nhad not decided whether to renew her Italian passport. In July 2009, a week before the \nhearing, she traveled to Italy using her U.S. passport, having not renewed her Italian \npassport. At the hearing, she testified she was not aware of the implications of her dual \ncitizenship during earlier inquiries, but she would renounce her Italian citizenship if it \nwas necessary. I conclude this mitigating condition is applicable.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by showing that \u201cexercise of the rights, \nprivileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a \nU.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(c). This mitigating condition is \nestablished because Applicant obtained and used her Italian passport when she was 14 \nyears old. Her mother registered her as an Italian citizen living abroad when she was 10 \n\n \n7 \n \n \nyears old. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had never updated the registry and \nshe was uncertain of the legal implications of not updating it. In this respect, she \nappeared to be the product of a military family, with a strong sense of duty to obey the \nrules. Her testimony about the registry also reflects her unfamiliarity with the security \nimplications of dual citizenship. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may \nbe mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This mitigating condition is established \nbecause Applicant\u2019s passport has expired and is invalid.  \n \n \nThere are no enumerated mitigating conditions applicable to Applicant\u2019s interview \nby a security investigator in October 2008. There are, however, several relevant \nconsiderations. The government exhibit is the investigator\u2019s summary. It does not reflect \nthe questions that were asked or how suggestive those questions were regarding the \ndesired answer; it only reflects Applicant\u2018s responses. Applicant authenticated the \ninterview summary when she responded to DOHA interrogatories in March 2009, but it \nis apparent she did not appreciate the security significance of the statements attributed \nto her. Even at the hearing, she did not dispute the statements attributed to her (except \nfor the \u201c50 percent loyalty\u201d statement), but instead she testified she misunderstood the \nconcept of allegiance and was really talking about her heritage. To the extent that there \nare differences between the personal interview summary and her testimony at the \nhearing, I am satisfied that her testimony is a more reliable indicator of her allegiance to \nthe U.S. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant is young and inexperienced. She did not understand the implications of \nher dual citizenship until the late stages of the security clearance process. She was very \nsincere and candid at the hearing. She grew up in a military family and is accustomed to \nfollowing rules and regulations. Even though there are differences between her \nstatement to a security investigator and her testimony at the hearing, she chose not to \nrepudiate her statements to the investigator, but instead chose to explain why her \nanswers did not reflect a preference for Italy. I do not believe she was adjusting her \nanswers at the hearing to be more politically correct. I am satisfied her hearing \ntestimony was intended to more accurately explain her attachments to the U.S. and \nItaly. Based on her testimony and demeanor at the hearing, I am satisfied that Italy is a \nsignificant part of her heritage, but that her allegiance is to the U.S. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference. Accordingly, I conclude \nshe has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C, Foreign Preference:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

O\u2019Neil, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nEven though Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in January 2009,\nhe still has two delinquent student loan accounts that have not been mitigated. The adverse\npersonal conduct is mitigated by the passage of more than five years without the\nrecurrence of acts of poor judgment. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant completed and certified a Standard Form 86 (SCA, GE 1) on June 24,\n2008. He was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) on August 5, 2008. A summary of this interview appears at pages 209 through 219\nof GE 3 (page numbers appear in the lower right corner of page) dated June 17, 2010. On\npage 102 of GE 3, Applicant acknowledged his agreement with the interview summary, and\nAugust 31, 2011\n\n2\nindicated the summary could be used in a security clearance hearing to determine his\nsecurity suitability. (Id. at 103) \nOn April 18, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E).\nThe action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\nimplemented by the Department ofd Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was notarized and submitted on May 10, 2010.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 1, 2011, for a hearing on July 20, 2011. The\nhearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, eight exhibits (GE 1 through 8) were\nadmitted in evidence in support of the Government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and offered\none exhibit (AE A). All exhibits were admitted in evidence without objection. He was\ngranted time after the hearing to submit additional evidence regarding his delinquent\nfinancial obligations. He submitted one exhibit (AE B), which was admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript on August 4, 2011. The record closed on\nAugust 4, 2011. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR lists six allegations under the financial considerations guideline. Applicant\ndenied subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. He admitted subparagraph 1.f that he\nfiled a Chapter 13 petition on May 9, 2008, and received a Chapter 7 discharge on January\n12, 2009. Applicant admitted all allegations under the personal conduct guideline. \nApplicant is 45 years old and has been married for about a year. He has one child\nfrom this marriage and two from a previous marriage. He served in the United States Navy\nfrom February 1998 until his honorable discharge in January 2000. In the same month, he\nwas hired by his current employer a cable installation technician, and has been working\nthere since then. In February 2011, he accepted a lateral transfer for a job in the local area\nwhere he supervises projects. (Tr. 37-39) In 2004 and 2005, Applicant applied for and\nreceived student loans (subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f) for attending information technology\ntraining. He is two classes away from completing the training. (Tr. 42) Applicant has held\na security clearance since 1998. (Tr. 37)\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant believes his financial problems were caused during his temporary work\nrelocation to Florida for six months between February and July 2010. (Tr. 56) Before\n\n3\nApplicant left, he and his brother agreed to take care of Applicant\u2019s house in another\nlocation and pay the utilities during the temporary duty period in the local area. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother breached the agreement by permitting guests in the house and failing to keep the\nhouse clean. Applicant returned to find the house dirty, and the utilities unpaid or shut off.\n(Tr. 56-58) While on temporary duty, Applicant occasionally called his brother and returned\nto the location where his brother was taking care of the house to renew his auto license.\nHe realized his house was not being maintained, but did not have time to deal with the\nproblems because of his temporary work assignment. (Tr. 58)\nApplicant has never had financial counseling other than the counseling required as\na condition precedent to filing bankruptcy in May 2008. (GE 3)\nThe credit bureau reports show his financial problems appeared between October\n2004 and February 2008 when five debts listed in the SOR became delinquent. (GE 6-8)\nTen additional unlisted debts that had become delinquent during the foregoing period were\ndischarged under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in January 2009. (SOR 1.f) AE B reflects\nthat SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, were also discharged in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nSOR 1.d and 1.e are student loans Applicant received in 2004 to pay for the\ninformation technology training he received in 2004. He explained that he originally applied\nand received eight student loans. Some of the loans were held by private companies and\nothers were managed by Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae). (Tr. 43-44)\nApplicant disregarded Sallie Mae\u2019s payment request notices because he mistakenly\nbelieved he had consolidated all the loans with another company. Applicant observed that\nthe Sallie Mae and other loans were currently being processed by other companies. (Tr.\n42-44) He stated he had bank statements to support his claim of making payments to Sallie\nMae for three years. (AE 15) Applicant provided no documentary support to support his\ncontention that all student loans were current. (Tr. 44)\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant explained that the four incidents cited in paragraph 2 of the SOR occurred\nduring a troublesome part of his life that began in 1999 when his first wife left him after five\nmonths of marriage. His wife\u2019s departure caused him to leave the Navy. Applicant\u2019s\nassociation with the wrong people led to marijuana use in April 2004, his possession of\nmarijuana charge and driving on a suspended license in August 2004. His marijuana use\nwas brief in 2004. (Tr. 49) He has changed his lifestyle by no longer associating with the\nwrong people. Instead, he spends more time at home engaging in family activities like\ncamping with his children. (Tr. 55)\nIn September 2004, Applicant got into an altercation with his girlfriend and hit her\nbefore immediately calling the police. (Tr. 18) In September 2005, he was convicted of\n\n4\ndriving while under the influence (DUI) and driving with a suspended license. (Tr. 51-53)\nApplicant indicated he does not have a history of violence and has a clean record since\nSeptember 2005. (Id.)\nIn October 1997, Applicant certified an SCA. (GE 4) On the last page of the exhibit,\nhe noted that he had used marijuana three times and had no intention of using the drug in\nthe future. On at least two occasions in 2004, Appellant used marijuana while holding a\nsecurity clearance. He indicated his choice to resume marijuana use several years later in\n2004 was not a good choice. (Tr. 53)\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no character evidence regarding his job performance or his\nlifestyle in the community where he lives. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the administrative\njudge must consider the AG. Each guideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\nThe administrative judge's ultimate goal is to reach a fair and impartial decision that\nis based on commonsense. The decision should also include a careful, thorough evaluation\nof a number of variables known as the \"whole-person concept\" that brings together all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non speculation or conjecture. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible\nrisk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set forth in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness\nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern\nas it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot\nbe explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may\nindicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nThe Government has the responsibility of presenting sufficient information to support\nall allegations of the SOR. Based on the credit reports, Applicant\u2019s interrogatory responses,\nand his answers to the SOR, the Government has presented sufficient information to\nestablish the financial allegations in the SOR. AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) applies to Applicant\u2019s inability to satisfy or address delinquent student loans\nunder the first paragraph of the SOR. The accumulation of delinquent accounts between\n2004 and 2008, culminated in the filing of a Chapter 13 petition in May 2008, a Chapter 7\ndischarge in January 2009, with two delinquent student loan accounts remaining,\nconstitutes a history of not meeting financial obligations with the scope of AG \u00b6 19(c) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations).  \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment) does not apply. Though Applicant received the\nstudent loans in 2004, both accounts continued to be delinquent. Applicant\u2019s claim of\npayments to Sallie Mae and the successor collection agency is not credible because he did\nnot produce supporting documentation. The failure to articulate a plan to resolve the\nstudent loan debt after receiving the loans in 2004 rules out the application of AG \u00b6 20(a).\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does\nnot apply because there was no unforeseen event beyond his control and close in time to\nhis financial problems. Applicant separated from his first wife in 1999. He did not begin\naccumulating delinquent debt until five years later in 2004. While he accumulated 15 \n\n6\ndelinquent accounts between 2004 and 2008, he was employed throughout the period. AG\n\u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant received financial counseling in advance of filing his May 2008 Chapter\n13 petition. Even though three of the delinquent accounts have been resolved through the\nChapter 7 discharge in January 2009, more than two years have passed since the\ndischarge and Appellant has not indicated what he intends to do about the two student\nloans. AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\napplies on a limited basis. \nThough Applicant has not made a good-faith effort to repay creditors as set forth in\nAG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts), he has resolved the debts to three creditors through a Chapter\n7 bankruptcy. Applicant receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).  Having weighed the\nnegative evidence under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) with the limited mitigating evidence under\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), and 20(d), the financial considerations guideline is resolved against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15:\nAG \u00b6 15. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe disqualifying condition that may apply is AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information).\nThe record indicates that Applicant\u2019s 2004 drug use, the 2004 aggravated battery, and the\n2005 alcohol-related traffic offenses, fall with the scope of the AG \u00b6 16(c).\nThere are two mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that may apply: AG \u00b6 17(c) (the\noffense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and AG \u00b6 17(d) (the\n\n7\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior\nor taken other positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to\nrecur). I find the traffic offenses mitigated by Applicant\u2019s admission and the passage of\nmore than five years. I accept Applicant\u2019s explanation that he realizes striking his former\ngirlfriend was inexcusable. Applicant\u2019s choice to use marijuana again in 2004 after he\nstated his intention in 1997 not to use the drug again is extenuated by the brief nature of\nhis use in 2004 and the passage of six years since Applicant\u2019s most recent use. Applicant\u2019s\ncredible explanations for his misconduct between April 2004 and September 2005 support\na finding in Applicant\u2019s favor under the personal conduct guideline.\nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nthe two guidelines. I have found against Applicant under the financial considerations\nguideline and for him under the personal conduct guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole-person concept. In\nevaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is 45 years old. His background includes an honorable discharge from the\nNavy in 2000. Applicant began working for his employer as a technician and became a\nplatform manager of the waterfront in February 2011. \nWhile Applicant stated his financial problems surfaced while he was on temporary\nduty in 2010, the record reflects Appellant began to have financial problems in 2004 when\nhis first account became delinquent. Because Applicant\u2019s first wife left him five years before\nhis delinquent debts started to accumulate, it is unreasonable for him to blame her for his\nfinancial problems. Rather, his financial difficulties occurred because of his poor choices\nin managing the money he earned from his uninterrupted employment. His financial\nmismanagement of 15 accounts led to the Chapter 13 petition he filed in May 2008, which\nhe converted to a Chapter 7 before he received a discharge in January 2009. More than\ntwo years have passed since his discharge, but he has taken no documented action to pay\n\n8\ndown the student loan debt. Alternatively, he has not tried to place the loans in\nforbearance, to provide himself additional time to decide how he wants to resolve the debt.\nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s successful Chapter 7 discharge in January 2009 is insufficient to find\nin his favor under the financial considerations guideline. \nThe personal conduct allegations have been mitigated by Applicant\u2019s credible\nexplanations coupled with the passage of five years since the last adverse incident. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPaul J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d (HE 3). He denied that he intentionally failed to provide accurate information on his security clearance application as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.d (HE 3). He also provided clarifications and explanations about the various SOR subparagraphs, and provided other mitigating information (HE 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 19).2 He is employed as a cultural advisor and interpreter (Tr. 46). He was born in Afghanistan (Tr. 19). In 1987, he moved to the United States (Tr. 19). In 1993, he became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 19). He worked as a translator from April 2004 until July 2009, primarily in Afghanistan (Tr. 20). Applicant\u2019s tribe in Afghanistan is an ally of the United States (Tr. 1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Paul Origlio, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was arrested once in 2001, twice in 2002, and once in 2003. The 2002 \noffense resulted in a conviction in 2004 for Possession of Injection/Ingestion device. On \nSeptember 7, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application and failed to \ndisclose these four arrests, and his 2004 conviction. He also failed to disclose 16 \ndelinquent debts and two liens. He mitigated the security concern under Guideline J \nbecause his criminal conduct was not recent; however, he failed to mitigate security \nconcerns under Guideline E. Access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 7, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On July 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \namended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and E \n(personal conduct) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn September 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge (HE 3). On October 7, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel announced he was ready to proceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On \nOctober 8, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On November 13, 2009, \nDOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 1). On December 15, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was \nheld. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) (Tr. 15-16), and \nApplicant offered four exhibits (Tr. 17-18; AE A-D). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 16), and AE A-D (Tr. 18). Additionally, I admitted the hearing \nnotice, SOR, and response to the SOR (HE 1-3). On December 23, 2009, I received the \ntranscript. I held the record open until January 19, 2010, to permit Applicant to provide \nadditional documentation (Tr. 101-102, 108). On January 19, 2010, I received additional \ndocumentation from Applicant and his employer (AE E). Department Counsel\u2019s \nobjection to the admissibility of portions of AE E is overruled. The objection to emails \nbetween Applicant\u2019s Counsel and an employee of the contractor goes to their weight, \nrather than to the admissibility of AE E.    \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.d (HE 3). He denied that he intentionally failed to provide accurate information \non his security clearance application as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.d (HE 3). He also \nprovided clarifications and explanations about the various SOR subparagraphs, and \nprovided other mitigating information (HE 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 19).2 He is \nemployed as a cultural advisor and interpreter (Tr. 46). He was born in Afghanistan (Tr. \n19). In 1987, he moved to the United States (Tr. 19). In 1993, he became a U.S. citizen \n(Tr. 19). He worked as a translator from April 2004 until July 2009, primarily in \nAfghanistan (Tr. 20). Applicant\u2019s tribe in Afghanistan is an ally of the United States (Tr. \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n2Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this section are from Applicant\u2019s September 7, 2005, \nsecurity clearance application (GE 1). \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n21). The United States freed his tribe from the oppression of the Taliban (Tr. 21-22). \nThe Taliban killed many people from his tribe (Tr. 22-23). Applicant loves the United \nStates and hates the Taliban and al Qaeda (Tr. 23). Applicant\u2019s family has supported \nthe United States for many years (Tr. 22). For example, Applicant\u2019s brother works as a \ntranslator for the U.S. government (Tr. 22). \n \nApplicant provided information to law enforcement about individuals associated \nwith or supporting the Taliban in his community (Tr. 25-26; 87-88). He moved from state \nC to state D, which was several thousand miles away because he was concerned about \nhis safety (Tr. 25-26, 87-88).  \n \nCriminal conduct \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin married Applicant\u2019s sister (he will be referred to hereinafter as \nCousin A). Applicant\u2019s sister was not living in the United States. Cousin A and Cousin \nA\u2019s girlfriend were living in Applicant\u2019s body shop (Tr. 26-27, 31-33, 87). They had \naccess to Applicant\u2019s computer (Tr. 26-27). Applicant said they used Applicant and his \nwife\u2019s personal information for identity theft (Tr. 27, 33). In December 2001, the police \narrested Applicant, and he was charged with five counts of using other\u2019s identity for \ncredit (SOR \u00b6 1.a; HE 3). In May 2002, the police arrested Applicant, and he was \ncharged with using other\u2019s identity for credit (SOR \u00b6 1.b; HE 3). On May 5, 2003, the \ncourt dismissed the charges relating to both arrests (Tr. 27; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; HE 3).   \n \nAround August 2002, the police arrested Applicant for failure to appear in court \n(Tr. 27-28). The police found drugs in a sock near where Applicant was sitting in a \npolice car (Tr. 30). When they arrested him, the police searched his person and vehicle \n(Tr. 28). Applicant denied possession of illegal drugs (Tr. 28-30). Nevertheless, the \npolice arrested Applicant for possession of drugs (Tr. 28).  \n \nAround August 2002, Applicant reserved a hotel room for a friend (Tr. 29). \nApplicant paid for the room for one day (Tr. 86-87). There was a warrant for the friend\u2019s \narrest (Tr. 29). The police found drugs in the room that Applicant reserved (Tr. 29). They \nalso found a drug pipe or a crack-cocaine pipe (Tr. 97). On August 7, 2002, Applicant \nwas visiting his friend at the hotel room when the police made the arrest (Tr. 100; AE A). \nApplicant was charged with two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia, and \npossession of a controlled substance (SOR \u00b6 1.c). On March 5, 2004, Applicant was \nconvicted of possession of injection/ingestion device after a contested jury trial (Tr. 31; \nSOR \u00b6 1.c). He was represented at his trial by a public defender (Tr. 94). The court \nsentenced him to three years of court probation, 74 days in county jail with credit for \ntime served, a $610 fine, and a $100 payment to the victim\u2019s restitution fund (Tr. 31, 69; \nSOR \u00b6 1.c; AE A). He served 63 days in jail, paid his fine and successfully completed \nhis probation (AE A).  \n \nIn March 2003, the police arrested Applicant for obtaining credit with another\u2019s \nidentification, and possession of drug paraphernalia (SOR \u00b6 1.d; HE 3). Applicant said \nthe charge was dismissed, and no record evidence was presented contradicting this \ndisposition. \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nApplicant denied drug possession and claimed someone set him up (Tr. 30). He \ndid not know who set him up; however, he suspected that Cousin A and possibly Cousin \nA\u2019s girlfriend were responsible for his arrests (Tr. 30, 33-34). Applicant thought Cousin A \nblamed Applicant for his divorce from Applicant\u2019s sister (Tr. 32, 88). Cousin A suspected \nApplicant of telling Applicant\u2019s sister about Cousin A\u2019s infidelity; however, Applicant did \nnot tell his sister about Cousin A\u2019s girlfriend (Tr. 33). The police told Applicant that \nCousin A and his girlfriend used crack-cocaine (Tr. 34). Applicant suspected Cousin A \nof telling others in the Afghan community about his cooperation with law enforcement \n(Tr. 88-89).  \n \nDisclosure of financial considerations3 \n \nFrom 1990 to 2003, Applicant owed a body shop in state C (Tr. 23-24). The \npolice searched his shop (Tr. 81). Cousin A was not supposed to stay in the shop (Tr. \n82, 87). Cousin A is not a U.S. citizen (Tr. 94). Cousin A\u2019s residence in the shop violated \nthe lease (Tr. 83). Applicant\u2019s landlord did not extend the lease where Applicant\u2019s \nbusiness was located when the lease-term was completed (Tr. 24, 81). His landlord had \npreviously promised to renew his lease, and then at the end of the lease the landlord \nlocked the doors and kept Applicant\u2019s equipment (Tr. 82). His landlord obtained a court \norder against Applicant (Tr. 82). Applicant owed the landlord some money (Tr. 84). \n \nIn 2003 and 2004, Applicant did not file an income tax return with state C (Tr. \n84). He did not believe he needed to file a state tax return because he lost his business \n(Tr. 84-85). In July 2004, state tax officials filed a $7,600 lien against Applicant and put \nthe information on his credit report (Tr. 85, 95; SOR \u00b6 2.c.i; HE 2, 3). He said he paid \nthe lien (HE 3). In February 2003, the country tax collector filed a lien against Applicant \nin the amount of $771 (SOR \u00b6 2.c.ii; HE 2, HE 3). He paid the lien (HE 3). \n \n \nThe SOR alleged the following debts were delinquent and should have been \nreported on his September 7, 2005, security clearance application: (i) judgment in May \n2002 for $360; (ii) tax lien filed in February 1996 for $900; (iii) credit card debt for \n$2,940; (iv) department store debt for $699; (v) bank debt for $632; (vi) bank debt for \n$410; (vii) department store debt for $383; (viii) collection debt for $64; (ix) collection \ndebt for $3,676; (x) telecommunications debt for $2,526; (xi) bank debt for $2,364; (xii) \ntowing \ncompany \ndebt \nfor \n$1,590; \n(xiii) \ncollection \ndebt \nfor \n$1,296; \n(xiv) \ntelecommunications debt for $158; (xv) telecommunications debt for $148; and (xvi) \ncollection debt for $107 (SOR \u00b6 2.d.i to 2.d.xvi; HE 2). Applicant said he paid all of these \ndebts (HE 2). The government did not contest Applicant\u2019s contention that his delinquent \ndebts were resolved. \n \nFalsification of 2005 security clearance application \n \nApplicant had past due financial obligations because he lost his body shop (Tr. \n37). In October 2005, Applicant moved from state C to state D (Tr. 36, 95). In 2006, \nApplicant discovered he owed taxes to state C when he decided to finance his home \n \n3 The SOR did not allege a concern under Guideline F (financial considerations) (HE 2). \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n(Tr. 35). He promised to pay his obligations (Tr. 36). He sent proof of his income in state \nB to the tax collection office in state C (Tr. 36). He said he found out about tax liens to \nstate C in the fall of 2009 (Tr. 37). \n \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s business was closed, and he went on welfare (Tr. 54-55). On \nApril 10, 2004, Applicant started working for his present employer, a government \ncontractor (Tr. 40, 54-55; 95-96; GE 1). He was first deployed to Afghanistan in May \n2004 (Tr. 95).  \n \nAfter Applicant started working for the contractor, Applicant signed \u201ca lot of \ndocuments\u201d about every six months (Tr. 41). He said he did not read the documents \nthat he signed (Tr. 42, 75-76). Sometimes a group of 20 to 50 contractors would sign \ntheir documents at the same time (Tr. 42). Applicant said when he signed his security \nclearance application, he thought it was just another Army contract (Tr. 42). No one told \nhim to read his security clearance application before he signed it (Tr. 77). He denied \nthat he read it before he signed it (Tr. 76, 78, 80). He did not read the certification on the \nsignature page of his security clearance application (Tr. 77; GE 1). He would not have \nsigned his security clearance application if he had known it contained false information \n(Tr. 43). He now understands the importance of reviewing before signing a security \nclearance application (Tr. 76). On September 7, 2005, he signed and dated the paper \ncopy of his security clearance application (Tr. 40; 77; GE 1). \n \nApplicant learned some English when he was in Afghanistan before he \nimmigrated to the United States (Tr. 44, 52). He learned more English after arriving in \nthe United States (Tr. 44). After leaving Afghanistan, he did not have any formal training \nin English (Tr. 45). He speaks English better than he writes it (Tr. 45). He does not \nunderstand legal words (Tr. 45). He can read English and has run a body shop for \nseveral years (Tr. 53). He understood the repair manuals, which were in English (Tr. \n53). Sometimes he asked another employee to read the manual to him (Tr. 54).   \n    \nApplicant\u2019s description of his interview about his security clearance application \n \nIn 2004 before he completed his SF-86, Applicant provided application \ninformation over the telephone to a recruiter or site manager for the government \ncontractor (hereinafter interviewer) (Tr. 38-39). He did not know the name of the \ninterviewer who talked to him (Tr. 55, 74). He did not try to find out the name of the \ninterviewer (Tr. 74). He told the interviewer over the telephone that he was arrested; \nhowever, he also told the interviewer his case had been dismissed (Tr. 38; GE 3, Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) interview). He meant the felony was dismissed (Tr. \n39).4 When he provided this information to the interviewer in 2004, Applicant knew he \n \n4 On August 22, 2008, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant (GE 3). On May 15, 2009, as \npart of DOHA interrogatories, Applicant adopted the summary of his OPM interview as accurate. \nApplicant\u2019s OPM statement does not indicate he was ever convicted. His OPM statement reads, \n\u201cBecause it was subject\u2019s business, he went to jail. Subject was given a court-appointed lawyer, posted \nbond, and in all [he] spent about two months in jail. The case went before a [state C] judge and was \ndismissed because of lack of evidence and no wrong-doing on subject\u2019s part.\u201d The SOR did not allege \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                            \nhad been convicted of the misdemeanor; however, he claimed that at that time he did \nnot know a misdemeanor was a criminal case (Tr. 39). He told the interviewer he had \nsome credit problems, such as missed and late payments (Tr. 40). The interviewer said \nit was no problem as long as he did not have a bankruptcy (Tr. 40). The interviewer did \nnot ask him if he had ever been to jail (Tr. 40). The interviewer said that if the case was \ndismissed, you are clean, and you have no problem (Tr. 39). He claimed he answered \nall of the interviewer\u2019s questions honestly (Tr. 40). I requested copies of Applicant\u2019s \nemployment applications from 2004, and provided a 30-day delay for Applicant to \nsubmit additional evidence (Tr. 101). Applicant and his employer were not able to locate \nany employment application (AE E). However, Applicant did provide a candidate \nchecklist, dated April 12, 2004 (AE E). The checklist had initials and dates in 11 areas, \nand no initials in five areas (AE E). His employer also provided an independent \nsubcontractor agreement, dated April 7, 2004 (AE E).  He is still employed by the same \ncompany that hired him in 2004 (Tr. 98).    \n \nThe interviewer asked Applicant about his family for his security clearance \napplication or his job application (Tr. 57). He did not fill out his own job application (Tr. \n57). He provided the name, address, social security number, and citizenship of his \nspouse (Tr. 62). He faxed his social security card, citizenship evidence, and driver\u2019s \nlicense to assist with his application (Tr. 57). The interviewer called Applicant and asked \nhis mother\u2019s maiden name and about his brother (Tr. 58). The interviewer asked \nApplicant about his previous addresses and about his body shop business (Tr. 59). He \nprovided information about his children (Tr. 64). The interviewer asked for the names of \nsome references and about any foreign travel, his U.S. passport, foreign contacts, and \nmedical problems (Tr. 66).  \n \nApplicant denied that the interviewer asked him about his previous employers \n(Tr. 59). He denied that the interviewer asked for the dates he ran the body shop or the \nbody shop\u2019s phone number (Tr. 60). Applicant\u2019s security clearance application indicates \nhe owned the body shop from September 1990 to December 2002 (GE 1 at 12). It also \nincludes his body shop\u2019s phone number and address (GE 1 at 12). The name, address, \nand telephone number of a person who can verify the employment information was one \nof his references (Tr. 60; GE 1 at 12-13). He did not provide the date of his marriage \n(Tr. 63); however, his security clearance application indicates Applicant and his spouse \nwere married in September 1992 in Pakistan (Tr. 63-64; GE 1 at 14).   \n \nApplicant denied that the interviewer asked him about his foreign activities, \nwhether he acted as a consultant for a foreign government, whether he had a foreign \npassport, his foreign properties, his employment record (whether he was fired or left \nemployment under adverse conditions), or his foreign businesses (Tr. 65-67); however, \nhis security clearance application includes answers to those questions (GE 1 at 21-23). \n \nApplicant denied that the interviewer asked him about his police record (Tr. 67). \nHe said he understood what it means to be arrested or charged with an offense and \n \nApplicant provided false or incomplete information about the resolution of his offense to the OPM \ninvestigator. I have not drawn any adverse inference from Applicant\u2019s OPM interview. \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nwhat it means to be convicted of an offense (Tr. 67-68). However, later he said he was \nunsure about what a conviction was (Tr. 70). He understood that he was convicted of \npossession of drug paraphernalia, and that he served 72 days in jail for that offense (Tr. \n71-72). He denied that the interviewer asked him whether he had ever been charged \nwith or convicted of any felony offense, whether he had ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any firearms or explosives offense, whether there were currently any \ncharges pending against him for any criminal offense, and whether he had ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any offense relating to alcohol or drugs (Tr. 67-68, 72). The \ninterviewer did not ask him whether he had been in jail or arrested (Tr. 56, 72). \nApplicant noted that the interviewer called Applicant \u201ctwo or three days\u201d later to question \nApplicant about his brother, and Applicant asked the interviewer about whether his \ncriminal record and going to jail might cause him not to be hired (Tr. 68-69).5 Applicant \ninsisted he told the interviewer about going to jail, and did not tell him about the \nconviction because he did not understand what a conviction was at that time (Tr. 73). \nApplicant explained that he believed when a charge was dismissed it was the same as \na conviction because the case was completed (Tr. 69). However, Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance application indicates, \u201cNo\u201d to all of these police-related questions about \narrests, charges, and convictions (GE 1 at 24-25).  \n \nApplicant denied that the interviewer asked him about his use of illegal drugs or \nconsumption of alcohol (Tr. 68). He denied that the interviewer asked him about \nwhether he previously held a security clearance or was investigated for a security \nclearance. However, Applicant\u2019s security clearance application indicates, \u201cNo\u201d to these \nquestions (GE 1 at 24-26).         \n \nApplicant denied that the interviewer asked him about liens, judgments, civil court \nactions, debts over 180 days delinquent, and debts currently delinquent (Tr. 73-74). He \ndenied that he knew what it meant to be 90 days delinquent on a debt (Tr. 74). He \ndenied that the interviewer asked him about his associations as indicated in his security \nclearance application (Tr. 74). However, Applicant\u2019s security clearance application \nindicates, \u201cNo\u201d to these questions (GE 1 at 26-27).         \n \nService in Afghanistan \n \nApplicant worked with U.S. military forces in Afghanistan as a linguist and cultural \nadvisor (Tr. 47). He accompanied troops in the field (Tr. 47). Sometimes he met with \nimportant Afghan officials, and other times he met with lower-level, local Afghan officials \nand tribal leaders (Tr. 47-48). Sometimes Applicant helped train Afghan police and \nAfghan Army officers (Tr. 47). He assisted with interrogations of detainees (Tr. 49). He \nwas able to save the lives of U.S. soldiers by warning the commander about Taliban \nambushes, including the placement of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) (Tr. 50). In \n2004, he received some shrapnel from an RPG, and the shrapnel was removed through \n \n5Later in the hearing, Applicant said that after he completed his application someone applying for \nsimilar employment raised the issue of credit problems and jail being a disqualifier for employment (Tr. \n78-79). In turn, Applicant raised these issues with the interviewer (Tr. 79).   \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \na surgery in Afghanistan (Tr. 51). He wants to return to Afghanistan so he can help the \nU.S. forces (Tr. 51).   \n \nRecommendations6 \n \n \nOn July 29, 2009, a lieutenant commander, who served with Applicant on special \noperations, lauded Applicant\u2019s service in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He went on multiple combat missions and was \u201cabsolutely mission critical.\u201d  \nHe was an \u201cirreplaceable member\u201d of his team. His linguistic capability, vast experience, \nand willingness to fight the Taliban shoulder-to-shoulder with the special operations \nforces were particularly noteworthy. \n \n \nIn 2007, a Department of Defense employee wrote recommending Applicant for a \nperformance bonus and salary increase. He indicated Applicant routinely went above \nand beyond the call of duty and was absolutely superb as an interpreter. He \nemphasized Applicant\u2019s dedication and competence.   \n  \nOn July 6, 2007, Applicant received a certificate of commendation for his \u201cquick \nthinking, intrinsic common sense, aggressive initiative and immense personal courage.\u201d \nHis actions saved lives and demonstrated his dedication to the mission and safety. \n \nOn March 14, 2007, a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel noted Applicant\u2019s service in \nAfghanistan from October 12, 2006, to March 22, 2007. Applicant routinely volunteered \nfor high-risk missions and worked at the most hazardous and productive locations. \u201cHe \nis without question the very best Department of Defense contract linguist in \nAfghanistan.\u201d  \n \nOn September 14, 2006, a high-level Department of Defense employee serving \nin Afghanistan described Applicant\u2019s contributions to the war effort as \u201ca key reason for \nthe achievement of success in operations. He was a hard working team player who \nconsistently produced good results, and he was a valued member of my organization.\u201d \nApplicant served at a remote firebase near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.  \n           \nApplicant provided five additional letters, not described previously, that similarly \ndescribed his performance as a linguist and interpreter in Afghanistan from April 2004 to \nJuly 15, 2005, and from May 2006 to August 2006. He also provided a certificate of \ntraining, and a certificate of appreciation.   \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \n \n \n6 AE B is the source for the facts in this section.  \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and E (personal conduct).  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d Applicant was arrested four times. The offenses relating to \nthree arrests were not sufficiently supported by evidence for the prosecutor to take the \ncases to trial. Applicant denied culpability for these three offenses. The offenses relating \nto these three arrests are not established.  \n \nCollateral Estoppel \n \n \nOn March 5, 2004, Applicant was convicted of possession of injection/ingestion \ndevice after a contested jury trial in state criminal court. He was represented at his trial \nby a public defender. The court sentenced him to three-years of court probation, 74 \ndays in county jail with credit for time served, a $610 fine, and a $100 payment to the \nvictim\u2019s restitution fund. He served 63 days in jail, paid his fine and successfully \ncompleted his probation. His conviction is a misdemeanor. Applicant denied that he \npossessed the drug paraphernalia. He denied criminal culpability for this offense. \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2009) the Appeal Board \naddressed the collateral estoppel effects of a guilty plea to assault and battery, a \nmisdemeanor, in a subsequent security clearance hearing and stated: \n \nThe Board recognizes that Otherson [v. U.S. Department of Justice, 711 \nF.2d 267 (D.C. Cir. 1983)] ultimately held that the federal misdemeanor \nconviction resulting from a contested trial and based on a conduct issue \nthat was before the Merit Systems Protection Board for hearing collaterally \nestopped the defendant from denying the underlying conduct at his MSPB \nhearing. Thus, there have been instances where federal courts have given \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \ncollateral estoppel effect to misdemeanor convictions and any language of \nthe Board suggesting otherwise is overstated.7 \n \nThe Appeal Board articulated a three-pronged test for deciding when a prior \ndecision would have collateral estoppel effect in a security clearance hearing: \n \nFirst, the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted must have \nbeen afforded a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate that issue in the earlier \ncase. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U.S. [306, 313 (1983)]; Allen v. McCurry, 449 \nU.S. 90, 95 (1980). Second, the issues presented for collateral estoppel \nmust be the same as those resolved against the opposing party in the first \ntrial. Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 155 (1979). Collateral \nestoppel extends only to questions distinctly put in issue and directly \ndetermined\u201d in the criminal prosecution. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, \n334 (1915). Third, the application of collateral estoppel in the second \nhearing must not result in unfairness. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 330 (1979)(detailing circumstances where allowing the use of \ncollateral estoppel would result in unfairness); Montana v. United States, \n440 U.S. at 155 (court should consider whether other special \ncircumstances warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion). \n \nSee also United States v. Holzmann, 563 F.Supp.2d 54, 78-81 (D.D.C. 2008); United \nStates v. Uzzell, 648 F. Supp. 1362, 1364 (D.D.C. 1986); United States v. Khan, 2008 \nU.S. Dist LEXIS 57043 (E.D. Mich., July 21, 2008) (all citing Emich Motors Corp. v. \nGeneral Motors Corp., 340 U.S. 558 (1951) as establishing preclusion effect of a guilty \nfinding from a criminal trial on subsequent civil litigation for the issues resolved against \nthe defendant); Truesdale v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89586 at *10-\n*12 (D.D.C. Sep. 29, 2009) (listing more restrictive three-pronged test as: (1) same \nissue; (2) issue actually decided; and (3) application does not result in basic unfairness \nand holding collateral estoppel bars defendant from pursuing issues in civil court that \nwere resolved against him at his criminal trial). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 7-10 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2009), the Appeal Board \nremanded the case to an administrative judge because there was insufficient \ninformation about that applicant\u2019s guilty plea (to misdemeanor assault and battery), and \nthe government had erroneously not been permitted to present aggravating information \nabout the greater offense (indecent sexual acts committed upon a child-victim). \n \nUnder collateral estoppel, the finding of guilty in Applicant\u2019s case by a state \ncriminal court after he contested the facts is binding on the federal government. His \ncriminal conviction is conclusive proof and operates as an estoppel on him as to the \nfacts supporting the conviction. \u201cUnder collateral estoppel, once an issue is actually and \n \n7 I was unable to locate any cases where a federal or state misdemeanor conviction after a \ncontested trial was not given issue preclusion or collateral estoppel effect. See Restatement of the Law, \nSecond, Judgments, \u00a7 86, \u201cEffect of State Court Judgment in a Subsequent Action in Federal Court\u201d and \nother cases cited in section 86. \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nnecessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that determination is \nconclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to \nthe prior litigation.\u201d Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. at 153.  \n \nThe state court\u2019s finding of guilty involves a determination of guilt beyond a \nreasonable doubt whereas the government need only establish a contested offense at a \nsecurity clearance hearing by a preponderance of the evidence, a lower evidentiary \nburden. It would be inappropriate to make a contrary decision when the key witnesses \nin Applicant\u2019s criminal trial, did not make a statement at Applicant\u2019s security clearance \nhearing. Moreover, a contrary decision in a federal agency-forum, would violate the \npolicy promoting comity between the state courts and the federal government. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1738 and Allen v. McMurry, 449 U.S. 90, 96 n.8 (1980). \u201cTo preclude parties \nfrom contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate protects \ntheir adversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves \njudicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of \ninconsistent decisions.\u201d Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. at 153-54. \n \nAs to particular facts established by his prior conviction, Applicant is estopped \nfrom denying that he possessed drug paraphernalia on August 7, 2002. See Otherson \nat 273-274. Applicant is not estopped, for example, from asserting extenuating or \nmitigating evidence concerning this offense. \n   \n  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nThe sole criminal offense that Applicant committed was on August 7, 2002, more \nthan seven years ago. It was a misdemeanor. There is strong evidence of rehabilitation. \nHe provided superb service to the United States in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2009. His \njob performance is a very strong mitigating factor. No drug-related offenses have \nrecurred. AG \u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) fully apply to his misdemeanor conviction in 2004.   \n \nAssuming the offenses relating to his three arrests are sufficiently supported by \nevidence to meet the substantial evidence test, the burden then shifted to Applicant to \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nmitigate the three arrests. The record does not contain sufficient evidence to contradict \nApplicant\u2019s denial of culpability for these three offenses. The offenses relating to the \nthree arrests that were not supported by conviction are not substantiated. AG \u00b6 32(c) \napplies.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative.8 \n \nOn September 7, 2005, Applicant signed his security clearance application. A \ncontractor employee (interviewer) previously interviewed Applicant before he signed his \nsecurity clearance application. The contractor employee asked Applicant whether he \nhad any prior drug-related charges or convictions, and Applicant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d A \ncontractor employee used the information Applicant provided to complete his security \n \n8The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nclearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant knew he had a prior conviction for \npossession of drug paraphernalia. He knew the court found him guilty of this offense, \nand he served about 60 days in jail post-trial because of this offense. He had three \nother arrests and knew how those cases did not result in a conviction. He had sufficient \ninvolvement in state C\u2019s criminal justice system to understand about charges, \nconvictions, and criminal offenses. Applicant\u2019s statement that he did not know what a \nconviction was in 2005 when he completed his security clearance application is not \ncredible. \n \nThe interviewer asked Applicant whether he had any other arrests, charges, or \nconvictions in the last seven years, and Applicant said, \u201cNo.\u201d A contractor employee \nthen used the information Applicant provided to complete his security clearance \napplication (SOR \u00b6 2.b). This question is broader than the previous question, and any \nadmission to criminal conduct under SOR \u00b6 2.a would be duplicated under SOR \u00b6 2.b \n(but not necessarily vice versa).  \n \nThe interviewer asked Applicant whether he had any liens placed against his \nproperty for failing to pay his taxes in the last seven years, and Applicant said, \u201cNo.\u201d A \ncontractor employee then used the information Applicant provided to complete his \nsecurity clearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant was in Afghanistan when the liens \nwere filed. It is not clear that he received notice of the two state liens prior to completion \nof his security clearance application. \n \nThe contractor employee asked Applicant whether he had any debts currently \nmore than 90 days delinquent, or any debts delinquent over 180 days in the last seven \nyears. Applicant said, \u201cNo.\u201d A contractor employee then used the information Applicant \nprovided to complete his security clearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.d). Applicant admitted \nthat he lost his business and was aware of delinquent debt. His SOR listed 16 \ndelinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false information to interviewer, who then \nprovided it to the employee who generated his security clearance application (the \ninterviewer and the person who prepared his security clearance application may be the \nsame person), and then Applicant subsequently signed the false security clearance \napplication. His contention that the interviewer did not ask him about his prior arrests, \ncharges, convictions, liens, and delinquent debts is not credible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) \napply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s false \nstatements cannot be mitigated at this time because they are too serious and too \nrecent. Even more importantly he was not truthful at his hearing. His argument that the \ncontractor employee did not ask him about his prior arrests, charges, convictions, liens, \nand delinquent debts is not credible.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. He has not committed any drug-related offenses since 2002. The sole \nestablished offense is a misdemeanor-level possession of drug-paraphernalia offense. \nHe served in Afghanistan about five years, and received extraordinarily positive \nsupporting endorsements from military personnel and civilian Department of Defense \nemployees. Applicant significantly contributed to the national defense. He voluntarily \nrisked his life as part of his duties on behalf of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and he \nwas injured by shrapnel in 2005. Reliable military personnel serving with him in \nAfghanistan laud his duty performance and contributions to mission accomplishment. \nHe has put himself in harm\u2019s way, working alongside U.S. Armed Forces. He has made \ncontributions to national security, fully aware of the risks to himself. All these \ncircumstances demonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts \nby a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or exploitation. See \nISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). There is no evidence of any \ndisciplinary problems at work. There is no other evidence of drug or alcohol abuse \nbeyond his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia. There is no evidence of \ndisloyalty. There is no evidence that he would intentionally violate national security, or \nthat he would deliberately fail to safeguard sensitive or classified information. His \ncharacter and good work performance show substantial responsibility, rehabilitation, \nand mitigation.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  The \nimportance of providing accurate information on a security clearance application is \nmanifest. It is even more important that an applicant provide accurate information at his \nor her security clearance hearing. Applicant received notice in the SOR that the \nDepartment of Defense might deny his clearance because in the past he was not \ntruthful and candid when he denied or omitted potentially disqualifying information from \nhis security clearance application. Nevertheless, he intentionally and falsely denied at \nhis hearing that he was asked by a contractor-interviewer about his prior arrests, \ncharges, convictions, liens, and delinquent debts. His contention that the contractor-\ninterviewer only asked him about his family and other questions that would yield non-\nderogatory or disqualifying information from him, and then the interviewer or other \ncontractor employee made up his answers to these highly-relevant questions, is not \ncredible. I also believe, contrary to his statement at his hearing, that he reviewed his \nsecurity clearance application before he signed it. I accept as true that he told the \ninterviewer his charges were dismissed. I did not believe his statement at his hearing \nthat he did not know a misdemeanor is a criminal case. At his hearing, he had an \nopportunity to correct his previous erroneous statements, and to admit that he \nintentionally provided false information on his security clearance application. He failed to \n\n \n17 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nadmit his mistakes. He failed to take full responsibility for providing false information on \nhis 2005 security clearance application. \n \nApplicant\u2019s false statements cannot be mitigated at this time because they were \nknowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He is 47 years old and sufficiently mature to \nbe fully responsible for his conduct. His false statements show lack of judgment and a \nfailure to abide by the law. Such conduct establishes a serious security concern, and \naccess to classified information is not warranted at this time. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to criminal conduct because his criminal conduct in 2002 is not recent. \nHowever, he has not mitigated the security concerns relating to personal conduct.     \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d9 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant (duplicates 2.b) \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 27, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on January 4, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On January 29, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 23, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was originally assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on March 19, 2009.  The case was reassigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on April 6, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 7, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for April 28, 2009.  The Government offered five exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection.\nApplicant called three witnesses and offered four exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through D.  He also testified on her own behalf.  The record remained open\nuntil close of business on May 19, 2009 to allow the Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentation.  Applicant submitted four Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 4 that were admitted into evidence without\nobjection. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on May 6, 2009.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 44 years old and has a high school diploma.  He is employed by\na defense contractor as a Flight Test Mechanic and Inspector and is seeking to obtain a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant joined the military in September 1982, and went in under the\ndelayed entry program in September 1983.  Prior to September 1999, the Applicant and\nhis wife were gainfully employed, although living beyond their means, they were able to\npay their bills on time.  In September 1999, the Applicant received military orders to\nmove out of state.  His wife was force to quit her job.  Once relocated, their income\nnever reached what it had been and they had difficulties paying their bills.  They\ndecided that the only way out was to file Bankruptcy.  In September 1999, the Applicant\nfiled for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  Their debts were discharged in bankruptcy in January\n2000.  \nAfter retiring from the military in March 2004, the Applicant and his wife got their\nreal estate licenses and went into real estate sales.  They were doing very well\nfinancially for a short time until suddenly, the market dried up.  The Applicant went\nabout eighteen months without a paycheck and fell behind on the financial obligations\nset forth below.\nThe Applicant\u2019s testified that when the Government sent him a copy of his credit\nreport, he learned for the first time that he owed a credit card debt in the amount of\n$1,412.00.  (Tr. p. 28 and Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4).  The Applicant settled this\ndebt on March 11, 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).   \nHe also learned of a debt he owed to a creditor in the amount of $65,000.00 that\nhad been charged off.  This was for a second mortgage on his home that he took out in\nJanuary 2006, when the real estate market was tough.  He used the money to live on.\nRecently, with good intentions, he set up a temporary arrangement with the creditor to\npay $200.00 a month toward the loan.  The arrangement automatically sent the debt\n\n3\ninto collection.  Applicant has continued to make the payments on time since the\narrangement.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  Applicant indicates that the creditor has agreed\nto settle the debt for $15,000.00 and the payment must be made by May 30, 2009.\nApplicant plans to settle the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).\nHe also learned of a debt he owed in the amount of $100.00.  He stated that he\noriginally paid the debt, but the check bounced and was returned.  He has since paid\nthe debt in full.  (Tr. p. 57 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).      \nWhile in the real estate business, the Applicant did not pay quarterly taxes on his\nincome.  As a result, he owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for back taxes, fees,\npenalties and interest approximately $47,000.00.  In November 2008, a lien was placed\nagainst the Applicant in the approximate amount of $47,642.00.  He hired a financial\ncounseling firm for $4,500.00 to assist him in negotiating with the IRS.  They did nothing\nbut take his money and request more.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  Applicant then decided\nto handle his financial matters himself.  He recently contacted the IRS and has since\npaid off his back taxes owed for tax years 2005 and 2007.  He currently owes\napproximately $49,024.10 for tax year 2006.  He has entered into an agreement with\nthe IRS to pay $600.00 monthly until the 2006 taxes are paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits 3 and 4).         \nApplicant testified that he has now learned to live within his means and operates\nunder a budget.  (Tr. p. 39).  He earns in excess of $100,000.00 a year, and his wife\nearns about $60,000.00.  He receives approximately $1,547.00 monthly in retirement\npay.  He has two checking accounts, one that contains $7,500.00, the that has\n$2,300.00.  One of his savings accounts has $100.00 in it, the other contains\n$16,027.00.  He has no credit cards, no other delinquent accounts, and is current with\nall of his regular monthly expenses.\nApplicant\u2019s witnesses include his second shift manager, a past military associate\nand a good friend each testified that the Applicant is reliable, trustworthy, honest and\nresponsible.  He is considered a man of high integrity.  His supervisor indicates that\namong the seventeen Flight Mechanics he supervises, the Applicant rates among the\ntop three.  (Tr. pp. 27-33, 78-81 and 93-95).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\n\n4\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19.(e) consistent spending beyond ones means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct \n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\n\n5\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\n\n6\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  After retiring from the military, and during the height of his real\nestate career, the Applicant was extremely careless and irresponsible.  He made a lot of\nmoney in a short time, lived extravagantly, and did not pay his taxes.  Since the\ndownturn in the real estate market, and his decision to re-enter the defense industry, he\nhas been reminded of the importance of maintaining good credit and fiscal\nresponsibility.  He has contacted each of his delinquent creditors and has either paid off\nthe debt or is making payments to them in a systematic fashion to resolve the debt.  He\nunderstands that in regard to each of his outstanding creditors, he must immediately\narrive at a permanent payment plan that is acceptable to the creditor and he must\ncontinue to make payments accordingly, until the debt is paid in full.  Under the\ncircumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is\nevidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can\nproperly handle his financial affairs.  In the event that he fails to follow through with his\npayment plans to his creditors and resolve his debt, his security clearance will be in\nimmediate jeopardy.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability  or  unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control and 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented and it sufficiently mitigates the\nadverse information brought against him.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.\n\n7\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 10, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing, which DOHA received on May 6, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nSeptember 18, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\nGE 1; AE A; AE C; Tr. 20.\n2\nGE 1; GE 3; Tr. 27-29, 51-50.\n3\n2\nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 9,\n2009, and I received the case assignment on June 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on June 16, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 16, 2009.\nThe government offered eight exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted three exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 22,\n2009. I held the record open until August 17, 2009, for the submission of additional\nmatters. The government timely submitted one additional document, GE 9, and the\nApplicant timely submitted six documents, AE D through AE I. All were admitted without\nobjection. The record closed on August 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f,\n1.h -1.l, 1.n, 1.o, 1.s, 1.u, and 1.v of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b -1.e, 1.m, 1.p - 1.r, and 1.t of the SOR.  He failed to admit or deny the allegation in \u00b6\n1\n1.g. At the hearing, he denied any knowledge of this account.  \nApplicant, who is 43 years old, works as a senior electronic engineer for a\nDepartment of State contractor. He has worked in his current position for more than 8\nyears. His supervisors praise his work skills, knowledge and performance. They\ndescribe him as reliable and dependable. His work has provided significant savings to\nthe government.2\nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Air Force for 10 years and\nthree years in the Air Force reserves. The Air Force honorably discharged him in\nDecember 2000. He married in 1988 and separated from his wife in 2004. His divorce is\nnot final. He has one step-daughter, who is 23 years old. He provides sporadic financial\nsupport to her while she is in graduate school.  \n3\nHe and his wife encountered financial problems in 1999 and 2000. They obtained\na home equity loan for $40,000. They decided that they would split this money equally.\nHe does not know how she used her share of this loan. He used his money to pay bills,\nincluding the debts to creditors identified in SOR allegations 1.c and 1.n. Applicant\nprovided documentation, which reflected he paid $2,200 in 2001 to the creditor listed in\n\nAE G; AE I; Tr. 31-32, 55.\n4\nTr. 52-54, 103-104, 118.\n5\nAE E; Tr. 54, 59-61, 111-116.\n6\nGE 6; GE 7; GE 8; Tr. 38, 44.\n7\n3\nallegation 1.c, but the information does not contain an account number or other\ninformation which would show that these are the same debts. In his post-hearing\nsubmission, Applicant advised that this debt will be removed from his credit report. He\ndid not provide any information which shows he paid the debt in allegation 1.n.4\nAfter he and his wife separated in June 2004, Applicant lived with his parents\nuntil April 2007, almost three years. He paid them $500 in rent and continued to pay his\nmortgage on the house where his wife lived. He also commuted a long distance to work,\nwhich resulted in gasoline bills of $600 a month. He moved into an apartment closer to\nhis job in April 2007. He found it difficult to pay the rent and utilities for his apartment,\nand pay the mortgage on his house. He moved out of the apartment in December 2007\nand now lives in a hotel suite for less money. He transferred title to the house to his\nwife, who has assumed all the expenses for the house.5\nApplicant earns $5,600 in gross income and approximately $4,000 in net income\neach month. His monthly expenses total $2,350, leaving approximately $1,650 a month\nto resolve his debts. His truck developed mechanical problems in October 2007 and\ncould not be driven. He finally repaired the truck at a cost of $4,000 in June 2009.6\nAs previously noted, Applicant denied several debts listed in the SOR. The credit\nreports of record reflected that Applicant disputed the debts listed in SOR allegations\n1.b, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.m. At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged he owed the debts in\nallegations 1.i and 1.k. As a result of his dispute, the credit reporting agencies removed\nallegation 1.b from his credit report. Concerning the other debts he denied, Applicant\nhas not provided proof he paid the debts, challenged the debts, or otherwise resolved\nthe debts as he believes. He has not paid the remaining debts he admitted owing.\nApplicant contended that allegations 1.o and 1.t are the same; however, the evidence of\nrecord does not support his belief.7\nApplicant denied the debt in allegation 1.g., which is a debt held by a collection\nagency unknown to Applicant. The original creditor is not identified in any of the credit\nreports. Given that Applicant does not know this creditor, allegation 1.g is found in favor\nof the Applicant because the government has not provided sufficient information for\nApplicant to identify the actual creditor and pay the debt.\n\nAE F.\n8\nAE B; AE H; Tr. 48.\n9\nAE G; AE I; Tr. 38, 89. \n10\n4\nApplicant recently hired a credit counseling service agency. Through this service,\nhe plans to pay the debts in SOR allegations 1.h, 1.i, 1.m, 1.u, and two other debts not\nlisted in the SOR. He did not provide proof of any payments made to this service.8\nApplicant failed to file his income tax returns for the tax years 2004 through 2008.\nHe has no explanation for his failure other than to say he was irresponsible. He recently\ncontacted a tax service to help him resolve his tax issues. He submitted an unsigned\ncopy of the retainer agreement provided to him by this company on July 31, 2009. The\nagreement required an initial payment of $500 and a second $500 payment by July 17,\n2009. Applicant did not provide proof that he signed the agreement and made the first\ntwo required payments.9\nThroughout the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he has been irresponsible\nwith his finances since his separation. He indicated that he planned to resolve his debts\nover time. He also indicated that he contacted several creditors after the hearing and\nwould be paying two bills by September 30, 2009 and had a payment plan for a third\nbill, which will be resolved by December 31, 2009.10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n5\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Following his separation in 2004, Applicant accumulated significant\ndelinquent debt, which he has not paid. He also failed to file his federal and state\nincome tax returns, starting in 2004. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems began in 2004 when he separated from his wife. His financial\nproblems continue to the present; thus, this mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose when he and his wife separated. He paid bills for\ntwo residences for a period of time. He ignored his duty to file his federal and state\ntaxes and allowed his debts to accumulate. This mitigating condition has minimal\napplication. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant recently retained the services of a\ncredit counseling agency. Because he just retained this agency, he has not developed a\ntrack record of payment, nor has he provided any evidence which indicated that his\nfinances are under control. This mitigating condition has minimal application.\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant expressed\nan intent to repay his bills, but he has not shown either a good faith effort to repay his\ndebts or a track record of debt payment. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nFinally, AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue\u201d applies to allegation 1.b. Applicant disputed this debt\nbecause he believed that he previously resolved it. As a result of his dispute, the credit\nreporting agency removed the debt from its records.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nperforms his job extremely well and his supervisors think highly of him. His separation\nfrom his wife in 2004 placed a strain on his finances for a period of time. This strain has\nbeen alleviated. He has sufficient income each month to pay his normal living expenses\nand to resolve his unpaid debts. He, however, did not take any action to address his\ndebts until very recently. He has not established a track record for debt repayment or\nprudent fiscal management. His failure to file his income returns for five years is\ninexcusable, and as he admits, irresponsible. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances\nunder Guideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Lacking any other guidance in the\nmatter, the Board will consider the representations of the parties concerning pertinent procedural\naspects of this case.\nConcerning the procedural issue of whether there is good cause to set aside the Judge\u2019s\ndecision and to reopen the record to allow Applicant to submit additional materials for the Judge\u2019s\nconsideration, the record indicates that at the April 8, 2010 hearing, the Judge granted Applicant a\nperiod of time post-hearing during which he could augment the record with additional documents.\nThat time period expired on April 22, 2010.  Applicant was instructed to forward any documents to\nDepartment Counsel by that time.  Applicant makes the following representations on appeal:\nApplicant represented himself below.  On April 14, 2010, he attempted to fax the documentation to\nthe number that he was given.  Several attempts to transmit the fax resulted in failure.  He then made\nattempts to contact Department Counsel and an administrative assistant at DOHA in an attempt to\nget the correct number for the fax.  Applicant indicates that he left several messages with the\nadministrative assistant and eventually got her on the phone.  He states that the assistant indicated\nshe would inform Department Counsel and the Judge and would let him know what additional steps\nhe should take.  Applicant asserts that he never heard back from the administrative assistant.  The\ntime period granted for extension expired, and the Judge rendered her decision.\nDepartment Counsel opposes Applicant\u2019s appeal.  He asserts that Applicant was provided\nwith his fax number.  He asserts that there is a presumption of good faith and regularity in\nadministrative proceedings, and that, in this particular case, there is a rebuttable presumption that\nhad Applicant spoken to anyone at DOHA, they would have contacted Department Counsel or the\nJudge.  Department Counsel argues further that Applicant was ultimately responsible for ensuring\nthat any documents he desired to have considered were submitted in a timely manner.  Therefore,\none would reasonably expect that Applicant would have made other efforts to ensure his documents\nwere submitted.  In particular, Department Counsel asserts that Applicant failed directly to contact\nDepartment Counsel using the telephone number he had been provided.\n\n3\nThe Board does not have the authority to make factual findings.  Nor can we determine from\nthe record before us that Applicant\u2019s appeal is without merit.  Compare, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n22217 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2008) (\u201cThe record as it now stands is inconsistent with Applicant\u2019s\ncontention on appeal that she detrimentally relied on poor advice from Department Counsel in\npresenting her case\u201d).  See ISCR Case No. 05-03941 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007).  In similar\nsituations, the Board has remanded the case to the Judge to address the matter raised on appeal.  See\nISCR Case No. 04-07825 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2006) (Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM not\nincluded in the record); ISCR Case No. 06-19169 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007) (Jurisdictional\ndefect); ISCR Case No. 01-20562 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003) (Record ambiguous as to whether\nApplicant was provided an opportunity to respond to a document considered by the Judge).\nAccordingly, we conclude that the best resolution of the issue raised in this case is to remand it to\nthe Judge.  She should reopen the record and give the parties an opportunity to address the issue\nraised on appeal, bearing in mind that federal agencies are entitled to a presumption of good faith\nand regularity in the performance of their responsibilities.  See ISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jun. 25, 2009); see also ISCR case No. 01-22311 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2003) (A party seeking\nto rebut the presumption of good faith has a heavy burden).  Thereafter, she should conduct further\nappropriate processing of the case, consistent with the Directive.    \nOrder\nPursuant to Item E3.1.33.2 of the Directive\u2019s Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board\nremands the case to the Judge for further processing consistent with this decision.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(Standard Form 86), signed on June 23, 2008, to request a security clearance required \nas part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \n \n 1  \nApril 30, 2010\n\n \n 2  \n                                                     \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \nOn June 15, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \nApplicant submitted a notarized Answer to the SOR dated January 14, 2010,3 in which \nhe denied 18 allegations under Guideline F, and admitted the remaining 5, \nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.l. He also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 26, 2010, and the \ncase was assigned to me on March 12, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nMarch 25, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 8, 2010. During the \nhearing, I admitted seven government exhibits (GE), identified as GE 1 through 7. \nApplicant testified, and offered two exhibits, admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and \nB. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence, but he did not \nsubmit further documentation. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 16, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the \nSOR, and the evidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, who is 48 years old, graduated high school and completed some \ncollege credits. He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the Air Force from \nJanuary 1981 to August 1982. Since 1991, he has worked in the information technology \nfield, starting with a job at a federal agency from 1991 to 2003. Since then, he has held \na series of temporary and short-term positions. He was unemployed for nine months \nbetween 2003 and 2004, and received unemployment compensation for six of those \nmonths. He was again unemployed for two-month periods in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He \nhas held secret and top secret clearances in the past, between 1981 and 1989, with no \nsecurity violations. He has held full-time positions since June 2008. (GE 1; Tr. 25, 27-\n30) \n \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which were implemented by \nthe Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The AG supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure \n2 to the Directive. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s earlier answers to the SOR failed to indicate admission or denial of each allegation. See GE \n3 and 4. \n\n \n 3  \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to the fact that he had only temporary \nand short-term jobs for five years, 2003 to 2008. As a result, his income has been low, \nas well as unpredictable. At the same time, he has had a series of medical issues \nincluding gout, kidney stones, and diabetes. These conditions have interfered with his \nability to work, and in one case caused him to be terminated because of excessive \nabsences. Without full-time employment, he often did not have health insurance \ncoverage for treatment and medications. Five of his debts relate to medical expenses \n(1.a., 1.n., 1.o., 1.v., and 1.w.). (GE 1; Tr. 16-22, 30, 35)   \n \n \nApplicant was allowed time after the hearing to provide his income, expenses, \nand budget; however, he did not forward additional information. He did testify that his \nrent is $750 per month, and his car loan is paid in full. He uses a check card, and does \nnot use credit cards. (Tr. 95)  \n \n \nApplicant paid for financial counseling in 2009, after receiving the DOHA \ninterrogatories, and signed an agreement for six months of counseling beginning March \n22, 2009. He met with the counselor three times. According to the counselor\u2019s letter, the \ngoal was to help Applicant \u201cdevelop a step-by-step process to get out of debt and \nmanage his money wisely.\u201d Applicant noted in his Answer that he does \u201cnot have \nperfect credit history nor reports. I am willing to clean this up\u2026\u201d However, he did not \nsubmit documentation of payment plans, or a budget developed through counseling. On \nhis counselor\u2019s advice, he disputed numerous debts on his credit reports and informed \nthe credit reporting agency. His counselor advised him that the agencies would contact \nthe creditors, and any creditor with a legitimate debt would contact Applicant. (GE 2; Tr. \n81) \n \n \nThe 23 debts listed in the SOR total approximately $60,800. The oldest became \ndelinquent in 2002. They appear in Applicant's credit reports of February and \nSeptember 2008, and April 2009. (GE 5, 6, 7) Applicant intends to pay his delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. 94) However, he disputed the validity of numerous SOR debts with the three \ncredit reporting agencies. (GE 2; AE A) Based on Applicant's challenges, Experian \ncredit agency deleted the following six SOR debts from Applicant's credit bureau report: \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. ($50); 1.c. ($1,274); 1.d. ($1,145); 1.g., ($1,078); 1.h. ($1,401); and 1.k. ($389). \nExperian verified the accuracy of the following challenged SOR debts: \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. ($527); 1.i. \n($74); 1.j. ($456); 1.n. ($4,601); and 1.o. ($10,977). (AE B) The status of Applicant's \nSOR debts follows. \n \nMedical debts: Allegations 1.a. ($50), 1.n. ($4,601), 1.o. ($10,977), 1.v. ($1,204) \nand 1.w. ($2,860) \u2013 DISPUTES. Applicant attempted to pay 1.a., but the creditor \nhad no record of the debt. The credit agency removed it from Applicant's credit \nreport. Applicant claims that the debts at 1.n. and 1.o. are duplicates, owed to the \nsame hospital for the same surgery. He does not believe he owes them because he \nhad insurance coverage at the time. The credit agency\u2019s investigation verified them \nas valid debts. Appellant stated he disputed the debts at 1.v. and 1.w., without \nfurther explanation or documentation. (GE 4; Tr. 36-37) \n \n\n \n 4  \nFederal tax lien: Allegation 1.b. ($7,410) \u2013 DISPUTES. Applicant owes back \nincome taxes for tax years 1997 through 2000, when he was employed by a federal \nagency. In 2002, he arranged to have payments taken from his salary. He left that \njob in 2003. Since then, he has made a few payments, and his federal tax refunds \nhave been applied to the debt. He disputes the amount, which he believes is now \napproximately $2,800. He did not supply supporting documentation. (GE 3; Tr. 44-\n48) \n \nCredit cards: Allegations 1.c. ($1,274), 1.d. ($1,145), 1.e. ($773), 1.f. ($527), 1.j. \n($456), 1.k. ($389), and 1.s. ($898) \u2013 DISPUTES. Applicant obtained a settlement \nagreement of $500 in January 2010 on the debt at 1.c., and testified he has made \none $50 payment since then. He provided no supporting documentation. He \ndisputed this debt with the credit bureau, and it was deleted from his credit report. \n(AE B) He admits owing a debt to the creditor at 1.d., but not the stated amount. He \nclaims he talked with the creditor, but does not have a settlement offer. He had no \ndocumentation. Applicant claims 1.e. and 1.k. are duplicates of the same debt, \nbecause the 1.k. debt was bought by the collection agency at 1.e. He testified that \nhe owes less than the alleged amount of $773, and that he has not made payments \non this debt. Applicant also believes that 1.f. and 1.j. are duplicates. He has not \ntaken steps to pay this credit card, as his plan is to start with bills that are more likely \nto be negotiable. Applicant was unaware of the credit card debt at allegation 1.s. \nuntil March 2009 when he received the DOHA interrogatory. He has not contacted \nthe creditor during the past year. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 49-59, 81-85) \n \nCommunications: Allegations 1.h. ($1,401), 1.i. ($74), 1.q. ($1,489) and 1.r. \n($276) \u2013 DISPUTES. Applicant had service from the company listed at allegations \n1.h. and 1.i, He received poor service, and disputes owing the debt. He claimed to \nhave documentation to support the dispute, but did not provide it after the hearing. \nHe testified that he contacted the communications company at allegation 1.q. and it \nhad no record of the debt. He currently has service from the company, with no \noutstanding balance. He did not provide supporting documentation after the hearing. \nApplicant denies any knowledge of the communications company listed at allegation \n1.r. He disputed this debt in his letter to the credit reporting agencies. (GE 2, 3, 4; Tr. \n60, 77-80) \n \nInsufficient funds: Allegation 1.l. ($467) \u2013 In 2004, Applicant deposited a bad \ncheck that he received from another person, which left his account with a negative \nbalance. He noted in his statements of July and September 2009 that he had made \npayments on this debt, but at the hearing, he testified the debt is not paid. (GE 2, 3; \nTr. 65-66) \n \nJudgment: Allegation 1.m. ($782) \u2013 The creditor sought a judgment against \nApplicant in 2002, but failed to provide adequate notice. The company garnished \nApplicant's pay in the amount of $667. Subsequently, the judgment was vacated for \ninadequate service of process. The creditor accepted the garnished amount as full \n\n \n 5  \n                                                     \npayment. Applicant did not provide documentation after the hearing to support his \nstatements. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 66-68) \n \nAuto loan: Allegation 1.o. ($28,683) \u2013 DISPUTES. Applicant purchased an \nautomobile in 2001, and in 2002 requested a voluntary repossession. It was sold, \nand a deficiency was not requested. The alleged amount is the full loan amount. \nApplicant contacted the creditor in late 2009, and later, the attorney who currently \nholds the debt. They could not agree on a settlement amount. Nothing further has \noccurred and he has no documentation regarding these contacts. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 71-\n76) \n \nStorage - Allegation 1.t. ($562) - Applicant stored goods from August to October \n2004. In his July and September 2009 statements, he said he would settle the debt. \nAs of the hearing date, he had not contacted the creditor or resolved the debt. (GE \n3; 4; Tr. 85-86) \n \nInsurance \u2013 Allegation 1.u. ($694) - DISPUTES. Applicant paid for month-to-month \ninsurance until he was dropped for non-payment. He denies owing the debt. He \ntestified that he complained about the error by telephone in 2006. He provided no \nsupporting documentation. (Tr. 86-88) \n \nUnrecognized debt \u2013 Allegation 1.g. ($1,078) - DISPUTES. Applicant does not \nrecognize the creditor and has no knowledge of this debt. He notified the credit \nreporting agencies and Experian has deleted the account from Applicant's credit \nbureau report. (AE B; Tr. 59-60) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.4 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly \nreferred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) at AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \n4 Directive 6.3 \n \n\n \n 6  \n                                                     \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his or his \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of \nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the \ngovernment.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nAn individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead \nto financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by \nknown sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) (inability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). The SOR alleges more than $60,000 in debts, which started to become \ndelinquent in 2002. Most of Applicant's debts remain unpaid, demonstrating a history of \nfailure to meet financial obligations. \n \n \n \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 7  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant's debts have been accruing for several years, they are not in \nthe distant past, as they remain unpaid. This fact, along with the lack of action taken by \nApplicant, indicates that they may remain unpaid in the future. His failure to make \nconsistent attempts to resolve his debts raises questions as to his reliability and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part because events occurred that affected Applicant's \nfinances, and which he could not control or foresee. He has serious medical issues that \naffect his financial status and are beyond his control. Although Applicant has not been \nsteadily employed for several years, the specific reasons why he did not obtain \npermanent employment and how much control he had over this situation are unclear. \nHe has been employed since 2008, but has done little to deal with his debts. Applicant \nhas not acted responsibly to resolve his significant delinquent debt load. AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies in part because of his medical issues. \n \n \nApplicant sought financial counselling and AG \u00b6 20(c) applies in part. However, \nhe did not seek it until March 2009, years after his financial problems arose. He sought \nhelp only after he received the DOHA interrogatories, indicating this action may have \nbeen simply a response to the security clearance process. In addition, the counselling \ndid not result in a plan to satisfy his debts.  \n \n\n \n 8  \n \nTo be applicable, AG \u00b6 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. \nApplicant was on notice that delinquent debts were a security concern after he \ncompleted his security clearance application in June 2008, yet he has accomplished \nlittle to resolve his debts. His financial situation is not under control. Without evidence of \na plan to resolve indebtedness, and steps taken to implement it, a good-faith effort to \nresolve debts cannot be substantiated. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant disputes most of the SOR debts, either as to the debt itself, or the \namount alleged. He provided documentation showing that he informed the credit \nreporting agencies of his disputes. As a result, several debts were deleted from his \ncredit bureau report. I find for the Applicant on those debts that the credit reporting \nagency deleted following its investigation. The credit agency verified that other disputed \ndebts were valid. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies. \n \n \nIn all, the mitigation available to Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(e), and partial \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) and 20(c), are insufficient to outweigh the fact that \nApplicant has a substantial debt load, that has existed for eight years, and he has taken \nlittle action in that time to pay his legitimate debts or to establish a plan to resolve them. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the appropriate guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nApplicant has accumulated substantial debts over the past eight years. He has \nnot established payment plans, and has not provided evidence of efforts to resolve his \nfinancial situation. An applicant is not required to be debt-free, or establish that he paid \nevery debt. But he must demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his debts \n\n \n 9  \nand has taken action to implement that plan. Here, Applicant has not established such a \nplan, and he still carries a significant debt load, with no documented efforts to resolve it.  \n \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the available information bearing on \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts \ncurrently raised about his suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the cited \nadjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c. \u2013 1.d.  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e. -1.f. \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.h\u2013 1.w.  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the record evidence, including Applicant's documentation submitted on April 29, 2011, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant, who is 48 years old, graduated high school and completed some college credits. He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the Air Force from January 1981 to August 1982. Since 1991, he has worked in the information technology field, starting with a job at a federal agency from 1991 to 2003. Since then, he has held a series of temporary and short-term positions. He was unemployed for nine months between 2003 and 2004, and received unemployment compensation for six of those months. He was again unemployed for two-month periods in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He has held secret and top secret clearances in the past, between 1981 and 1989, with no security violations. He has held full-time positions since June 2008. (GE 1; Tr. 25, 27- 30) Applicant attributes his financial problems to the fact that he had only temporary and short-term jobs for five years, 2003 to 2008. As a result, his income has been low, as well as unpredictable. At the same time, he has had a series of medical issues including gout, kidney stones, and diabetes. These conditions have interfered with his ability to work, and in one case caused him to be terminated because of excessive absences.

On February 15, 2011, the Appeal Board remanded the \ncase to me to reopen the record to consider additional evidence that Applicant contends \nhe was unable to submit. I reopened the record, and have considered the additional \nevidence that Applicant submitted. I conclude that the security concerns raised under \nthe guideline for financial considerations remain unmitigated. Clearance is denied.  \n \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n 1  \nMay 26, 2011\n\n \n 2  \n                                                     \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(Standard Form 86), signed on June 23, 2008, to request a security clearance required \nas part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \nOn June 15, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \nApplicant submitted a notarized Answer to the SOR dated January 14, 2010,3 in which \nhe denied 18 allegations and admitted the remaining 5, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.j., \n1.k., and 1.l. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 26, 2010, and the \ncase was assigned to me on March 12, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nMarch 25, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 8, 2010. During the \nhearing, I admitted seven government exhibits (GE), identified as GE 1 through 7. \nApplicant testified, and offered two exhibits, admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and \nB. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence, but he did not \nsubmit further documentation. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 16, 2010. \n \nOn April 30, 2010, I issued a decision denying Applicant's request for a security \nclearance. Applicant appealed, stating that he was unable to provide additional \nevidence to Department Counsel after the hearing because of mechanical and \nadministrative difficulties. On February 15, 2011, the Appeal Board remanded the case \nto me to reopen the record to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. I held \na teleconference on March 28, 2011, with Applicant and Chief Department Counsel. On \nthe same day, I emailed both parties outlining the results of our conference. By Order \ndated March 31, 2011, I required Applicant to submit any further documentation by \nFriday, April 29, 2011. Applicant timely submitted the following four documents:  \n \nAE I \n- Telephone company bill, dated April 10, 2010; \n \nAE II - Page 2 of Experian credit bureau report, dated February 8, 2010 \n \n(duplicate of page 2 of AE B); \n \nAE III  - One page of TransUnion credit bureau report dated January 22, 2010; \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which were implemented by \nthe Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The AG supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure \n2 to the Directive. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s earlier answers to the SOR failed to indicate admission or denial of each allegation. See GE \n3 and 4. \n\n \n 3  \n \nAE IV - Applicant's statement discussing mitigating conditions under Guideline F \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record evidence, including Applicant's \ndocumentation submitted on April 29, 2011, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, who is 48 years old, graduated high school and completed some \ncollege credits. He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the Air Force from \nJanuary 1981 to August 1982. Since 1991, he has worked in the information technology \nfield, starting with a job at a federal agency from 1991 to 2003. Since then, he has held \na series of temporary and short-term positions. He was unemployed for nine months \nbetween 2003 and 2004, and received unemployment compensation for six of those \nmonths. He was again unemployed for two-month periods in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He \nhas held secret and top secret clearances in the past, between 1981 and 1989, with no \nsecurity violations. He has held full-time positions since June 2008. (GE 1; Tr. 25, 27-\n30) \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to the fact that he had only temporary \nand short-term jobs for five years, 2003 to 2008. As a result, his income has been low, \nas well as unpredictable. At the same time, he has had a series of medical issues \nincluding gout, kidney stones, and diabetes. These conditions have interfered with his \nability to work, and in one case caused him to be terminated because of excessive \nabsences. Without full-time employment, he often did not have health insurance \ncoverage for treatment and medications. Five of his debts relate to medical expenses \n(1.a., 1.n., 1.o., 1.v., and 1.w.). (GE 1; Tr. 16-22, 30, 35)   \n \n \nApplicant was allowed time after the hearing to provide his income, expenses, \nand budget; however, he did not forward this information. He did testify that his rent is \n$750 per month, and his car loan is paid in full. He uses a check card, and does not use \ncredit cards. (Tr. 95)  \n \n \nIn 2009, Applicant paid for financial counseling after receiving the DOHA \ninterrogatories. He signed an agreement for six months of counseling beginning March \n22, 2009. He met with the counselor three times. According to the counselor\u2019s letter, the \ngoal was to help Applicant \u201cdevelop a step-by-step process to get out of debt and \nmanage his money wisely.\u201d Applicant noted in his Answer that he does \u201cnot have \nperfect credit history nor reports. I am willing to clean this up\u2026\u201d However, he did not \nsubmit documentation of payment plans, or a budget developed through counseling. On \nhis counselor\u2019s advice, he disputed numerous debts on his credit reports and informed \nthe credit reporting agency. His counselor advised him that the agencies would contact \nthe creditors, and any creditor with a legitimate debt would contact Applicant. (GE 2; Tr. \n81) \n \n\n \n 4  \n \nThe 23 debts listed in the SOR total approximately $68,000. The oldest became \ndelinquent in 2002. They appear in Applicant's credit reports of February and \nSeptember 2008, and April 2009. (GE 5, 6, 7) Applicant intends to pay his legitimate \ndebts. (Tr. 94) However, he disputed the validity of most of the SOR debts with the \ncredit reporting agencies. (GE 2; AE A)  \n \n \nBased on Applicant's challenges, Experian credit agency deleted the following \nfive SOR debts, totaling $3,936, from Applicant's credit bureau report:  \n \n \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. ($50); 1.c. ($1,274); 1.d. ($1,145); 1.g., ($1,078); and 1.k. ($389). \n \n \nExperian verified the accuracy of the following six challenged SOR debts, totaling \n$18,036:  \n \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.f. ($527); 1.h. ($1,401); 1.i. ($74); 1.j. ($456); 1.n. ($4,601); and 1.o. \n($10,977). (AE B)  \n \n \nTransUnion also deleted \u00b6 1.b. ($7,410) (as well as \u00b6\u00b6 1.k. and 1.g.) It verified an \nadditional allegation:1.w. ($2,860) (as well as \u00b6\u00b6 1.n; 1.o.). (AE II, III)  \n \n \nThe status of Applicant's SOR debts follows. \n \nMedical debts: Allegations 1.a. ($50), 1.n. ($4,601), and 1.o. ($10,977) \u2013 \nDISPUTED. Applicant attempted to pay 1.a., but the creditor had no record of the \ndebt. The credit agency deleted it from Applicant's credit report. Applicant claims \nthat the debts at 1.n. and 1.o. are duplicates, owed to the same hospital for the \nsame surgery. He does not believe he owes them because he had insurance \ncoverage at the time. The credit agency\u2019s investigation verified them as valid \ndebts. Applicant's newly submitted TransUnion credit report also shows that the \ndebts at 1.n. and 1.o. have been verified as accurate. (GE 4; AE II, III; Tr. 36-37) \n \nMedical debts: Allegations 1.v. ($1,204) and 1.w. ($2,860) \u2013 DISPUTED. \nApplicant stated he disputed the debts at 1.v. and 1.w., because he believes that \nhis health insurance should have covered them. Applicant's newly submitted \nTransUnion credit report does not list the account number for the debt at \nallegation 1.v. It also shows that the debt at \u00b6 1.w. has been verified. (GE 6; AE \nIII; Tr. 88-89) \n \nFederal tax lien: Allegation 1.b. ($7,410) \u2013 DISPUTED AND DELETED. \nApplicant owes back income taxes for tax years 1997 through 2000, when he \nwas employed by a federal agency. In 2002, he arranged to have payments \ntaken from his salary. He left that job in 2003. Since then, he has made a few \npayments, and his federal tax refunds have been applied to the debt. He disputes \nthe amount, which he believes is currently about $2,800. Applicant's newly \nsubmitted TransUnion credit bureau report shows that this lien has been deleted. \n(GE 3; AE III, Tr. 44-48) \n\n \n 5  \n \nCredit cards: Allegations 1.c. ($1,274), 1.d. ($1,145), and 1.s. ($898) \u2013 \nDISPUTED; 1.c., 1.d. DELETED. Applicant obtained a settlement agreement of \n$500 in January 2010 on the debt at 1.c., and testified he has made one $50 \npayment since then. He provided no supporting documentation. He disputed this \ndebt with the credit bureau, and it was deleted from his Experian credit report. He \nadmits owing a debt to the creditor at 1.d., but not the stated amount. He testified \nhe talked with the creditor, but did not receive a settlement offer. The debt at \nallegation 1.d. has been deleted from his Experian credit bureau report. Applicant \nwas unaware of the credit card debt at allegation 1.s. until March 2009 when he \nreceived the DOHA interrogatory. He has not contacted the creditor during the \npast year. (GE 3, 4; AE B, II; Tr. 49-59, 81-85) \n \nCredit cards: Allegations 1.e. ($773) and 1.k. ($389) \u2013 DISPUTED AND \nDELETED. Applicant testified that 1.e. and 1.k. are duplicates of the same debt, \nbecause the 1.k. debt was bought by the collection agency at 1.e. He testified \nthat he owes the debt, but not the alleged amount of $773, and that he had not \nmade payments on this debt. The account alleged at 1.k. is shown as \u201cdeleted\u201d \non the newly submitted TransUnion credit bureau report. (GE 3, 4; AE II, III; Tr. \n54-57) \n \nCredit cards: Allegations 1.f. ($527) and 1.j. ($456) \u2013 DISPUTED. Applicant \nbelieves that 1.f. and 1.j. are duplicates. He had not taken steps to pay this credit \ncard at the time of the hearing, as his plan was to start with creditors that were \nmore likely to be willing to negotiate. In Applicant's newly submitted TransUnion \ncredit report, the account alleged at 1.j. is shown as \u201cnew information below.\u201d \nHowever, AE III consists of only one page of the credit bureau report and does \nnot show the \u201cnew information.\u201d However, both of these debts were verified by \nthe Experian investigation. (GE 3, 4; AE B, III; Tr. 54-57) \n \nUnrecognized debt \u2013 Allegation 1.g. ($1,078) - DISPUTED AND DELETED. \nApplicant does not recognize the creditor and has no knowledge of this debt. He \nnotified the credit reporting agencies, and Experian has deleted the account from \nApplicant's credit bureau report. The account alleged at 1.g. is shown as \n\u201cdeleted\u201d on the newly submitted TransUnion credit bureau report. (GE 3, 4; AE \nB, II, III; Tr. 59-60) \n \nCommunications: Allegations 1.h. ($1,401) and 1.i. ($74) \u2013 DISPUTED. \nApplicant had service from the phone company listed at allegations 1.h. and 1.i. \nHe received poor service, and cancelled the account. He testified that he had \ndocumentation to support the dispute, but did not provide it after the hearing or \nwith his newly submitted documents. The company prorated the amount to be \npaid, but he disputes owing it. His exhibit B described the account as \u201cverified \nand updated on January 2010.\u201d He testified he would provide documentation of \nhis complaint to the Federal Communications Commission, but did not provide it \nafter the hearing. In Applicant's newly submitted TransUnion credit report, the \n\n \n 6  \naccount alleged at 1.h. is shown as \u201cnew information below.\u201d However, AE III \nconsists of only one page of the credit bureau report and does not show the \u201cnew \ninformation\u201d for this account. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to establish if \nits status has changed since it was verified in January 2010. (GE 2, 3, 4; AE B, II, \nIII; Tr. 60-63) \n \nCommunications: Allegations 1.q. ($1,489) and 1.r. ($276) \u2013 DISPUTED. \nApplicant testified that he contacted the communications company at allegation \n1.q. and it had no record of the debt. He currently has service from the company. \nHis newly submitted information includes a bill from the same communications \ncompany that does not show an outstanding balance. Applicant denies any \nknowledge of the communications company listed at allegation 1.r. He disputed \nthis debt in his letter to the credit reporting agencies. The single page that \nApplicant submitted from January 2010 credit bureau report includes no \ninformation on this debt. (GE 2, 3, 4; AE I, IV; Tr. 77-80) \n \nInsufficient funds: Allegation 1.l. ($467) \u2013 UNPAID. In 2004, Applicant \ndeposited a bad check that he received from another person, which left his \naccount with a negative balance. He noted in his statements of July and \nSeptember 2009 that he had made payments on this debt, but at the hearing, he \ntestified the debt is not paid. (GE 2, 3; Tr. 65-66) \n \nJudgment: Allegation 1.m. ($782) \u2013 Applicant testified that the creditor sought a \njudgment against him in 2002, but failed to provide adequate notice. The \ncompany garnished Applicant's pay in the amount of $667. Subsequently, the \njudgment was vacated for inadequate service of process. The creditor accepted \nthe garnished amount as full payment. Applicant did not provide documentation \nafter the hearing to support his statements. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 66-68) \n \nAuto loan: Allegation 1.p. ($28,683) \u2013 UNPAID. Applicant purchased an \nautomobile in 2001, and in 2002 requested a voluntary repossession. It was sold, \nand a deficiency was not requested. The alleged amount is the full loan amount. \nApplicant contacted the creditor in late 2009, and later, contacted the attorney \nwho currently holds the debt. They could not agree on a settlement amount. \nNothing further has occurred and he has no documentation regarding these \ncontacts. (GE 3, 4; Tr. 71-76) \n \nStorage - Allegation 1.t. ($562) - UNPAID. Applicant stored goods from August \nto October 2004. In his July and September 2009 statements, he said he would \nsettle the debt. As of the hearing date, he had not contacted the creditor or \nresolved the debt. (GE 3; 4; Tr. 85-86) \n \nInsurance \u2013 Allegation 1.u. ($694) - DISPUTED. Applicant paid for month-to-\nmonth insurance until he was dropped for non-payment. He denies owing the \ndebt. He testified that he complained about the error by telephone in 2006. He \nprovided no supporting documentation. (Tr. 86-88) \n\n \n 7  \n                                                     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.4 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly \nreferred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) at AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his or his \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of \nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the \ngovernment.7 \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n4 Directive 6.3 \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 8  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nAn individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead \nto financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by \nknown sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nOf the nine disqualifying conditions listed under Guideline F, the evidence \nsupports application of two: AG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \nAG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). The SOR alleges more than \n$60,000 in debts, which started to become delinquent in 2002. Most of Applicant's debts \nremain unpaid, demonstrating a history of failure to meet financial obligations. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant's debts have been accruing for several years, they are not in \nthe distant past, as many remain unpaid. This fact, along with the lack of action taken by \nApplicant, indicates that they may remain unpaid in the future. His failure to make \n\n \n 9  \nconsistent attempts to resolve his debts raises questions about his reliability and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part because events occurred that affected Applicant's \nfinances, and which he could not control or foresee. He has serious medical issues that \naffect his financial status and are beyond his control. Although Applicant was not \nsteadily employed for several years, the specific reasons why he did not obtain \npermanent employment and how much control he had over this situation are unclear. \nHe has been employed full-time since 2008, but has not acted responsibly to resolve his \nsubstantial delinquent debt load. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part because of his medical \nissues. \n \n \nApplicant sought financial counselling and AG \u00b6 20(c) applies in part. However, \nhe did not seek it until March 2009, years after his financial problems arose. He sought \nthis help only after he received the DOHA interrogatories, indicating this action was \nprimarily a response to the security clearance process. The counselling was beneficial \nin informing him how to dispute inaccurate credit bureau report entries, and he has \nacted on that information. However, the purpose of counseling is to develop a plan to \npay his debts and to implement it. He has done neither.  \n \n \nTo be applicable, AG \u00b6 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. \nApplicant was on notice that delinquent debts were a security concern after he \ncompleted his security clearance application in June 2008, yet he has accomplished \nlittle to deal with his financial obligations. Without evidence of a plan to resolve his \nindebtedness, and steps taken to implement it, a good-faith effort to resolve debts \ncannot be substantiated. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant disputes most of the SOR debts, either as to the debt itself, or the \namount alleged. He provided documentation showing that he informed the credit \nreporting agencies of his disputes. As a result, six debts were deleted from his credit \nreport. I find for the Applicant on those debts that the credit reporting agency deleted \nfollowing its investigation. The credit agency also verified that other disputed debts were \nvalid. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies. \n \n \nIn all, the mitigation available to Applicant is insufficient to outweigh the fact that \na substantial debt load remains, and Applicant has taken little action over many years to \npay his debts or to establish a plan to resolve them. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the appropriate guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nApplicant has accumulated substantial delinquencies over the past eight years. \nHe has justifiably sought to correct the erroneous entries on his credit report. With help \nfrom his counselor, he filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies, which resulted in \nan investigation and deletion of debts totaling $11,346. It also verified the accuracy of \nseveral challenged debts that total $20,896. \n \n \nHowever, the primary goal of financial counseling is to establish a plan of attack \nto deal with delinquencies. Even with the deletions from his credit report, Applicant still \ncarries more than $50,000 in delinquent debt. He has not established a payment plan to \nshow how he will pay down this debt. An applicant is not required to be debt-free, or \nestablish that he paid every debt. But he must demonstrate that he has established a \nplan to resolve his debts and has taken action to implement that plan. The evidence \nApplicant recently submitted provided information about his disputes, but again, no \nevidence of efforts to establish or implement a plan to deal with his significant debt load.  \n \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the available information bearing on \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts \ncurrently raised about his suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the cited \nadjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.d.  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e. -1.f. \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g.  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h. \u2013 1.j.  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k.  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l. \u2013 1.p.  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q.  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r. \u2013 1.w.  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow applicant access to classified information.

    "judges_findings_of_fact": "After a thorough review of the record evidence, including Applicant's documentation submitted on April 29, 2011, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant, who is 48 years old, graduated high school and completed some college credits. He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the Air Force from January 1981 to August 1982. Since 1991, he has worked in the information technology field, starting with a job at a federal agency from 1991 to 2003. Since then, he has held a series of temporary and short-term positions. He was unemployed for nine months between 2003 and 2004, and received unemployment compensation for six of those months. He was again unemployed for two-month periods in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He has held secret and top secret clearances in the past, between 1981 and 1989, with no security violations. He has held full-time positions since June 2008. (GE 1; Tr. 25, 27- 30) Applicant attributes his financial problems to the fact that he had only temporary and short-term jobs for five years, 2003 to 2008. As a result, his income has been low, as well as unpredictable. At the same time, he has had a series of medical issues including gout, kidney stones, and diabetes. These conditions have interfered with his ability to work, and in one case caused him to be terminated because of excessive absences. Without full-time employment, he often did not have health insurance coverage for treatment and medications. Five of his debts relate to medical expenses (1.a., 1.n., 1.o., 1.v., and 1.w.). (GE 1; Tr. 16-22, 30, 35) Applicant was allowed time after the hearing to provide his income, expenses, and budget; however, he did not forward this information. He did testify that his rent is $750 per month, and his car loan is paid in full. He uses a check card, and does not use credit cards. (Tr. 95) In 2009, Applicant paid for financial counseling after receiving the DOHA interrogatories. He signed an agreement for six months of counseling beginning March 22, 2009. He met with the counselor three times. According to the counselor\u2019s letter, the goal was to help Applicant \u201cdevelop a step-by-step process to get out of debt and manage his money wisely.\u201d Applicant noted in his Answer that he does \u201cnot have perfect credit history nor reports. I am willing to clean this up\u2026\u201d However, he did not submit documentation of payment plans, or a budget developed through counseling. On his counselor\u2019s advice, he disputed numerous debts on his credit reports and informed the credit reporting agency. His counselor advised him that the agencies would contact the creditors, and any creditor with a legitimate debt would contact Applicant. (GE 2; Tr. 81) 4 The 23 debts listed in the SOR total approximately $68,000. The oldest became delinquent in 2002. They appear in Applicant's credit reports of February and September 2008, and April 2009. (GE 5, 6, 7) Applicant intends to pay his legitimate debts. (Tr. 94) However, he disputed the validity of most of the SOR de",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 4, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 4, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were\nsupported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge failed to consider record evidence\nfavorable to Applicant; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Although Applicant experienced\nunemployment during the entire year 2003, he has been continuously employed since 2004.  The\nJudge stated that, assuming the information about his income and expenditures is correct, he has a\nnegative cash flow each month. In the Analysis portion of her decision, the Judge considered\nApplicant\u2019s period of unemployment.  However, she noted that he had experienced difficulty\nmanaging his finances for over 17 years and that he had failed to demonstrate responsible action in\nregard to his debts.  While acknowledging that Applicant has paid off some of his debts, the Judge\nconcluded nevertheless that these positive steps were outweighed by the extent of his remaining debt\nand his \u201clong history of financial irresponsibility[.]\u201d Decision at 8.  Accordingly, she concluded that\nApplicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in his case.\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant submits new evidence to the effect that he entered into\na debt management program after the close of the record.

In this case, the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and analysis demonstrate that she did\nconsider, among other things, Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment as a contributing factor to his\nfinancial difficulties and the fact that he had paid off some of his debts.  However, she reasonably\nexplained why Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence was not sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion\nas to mitigation.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

On June 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 31, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November 4, \n2009. The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2009. On November 12, 2009, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for December 1, 2009. The case \nwas heard on that date. The government offered four exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4.

Applicant also timely submitted a \nfour-page document that was admitted as AE K. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE \nK is marked as HE II. The transcript (Tr) was received on December 10, 2009.  Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old security officer, employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor, who is applying for a security clearance. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer for over a year and a half. He previously held a security clearance \nfrom 1990 to 1995. He is a high school graduate. He is married and has two \nstepchildren, a stepdaughter, age 23, and a stepson, age 21. All of his stepchildren live \nwith him and his wife. His stepdaughter\u2019s husband and baby also live with them. (Tr at \n4-5, 48-49; Gov 1.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has a \nhistory of financial problems. On July 21, 2000, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nApproximately $25,000 in debts were discharged. Most of the debts consisted of an \nautomobile repossession and credit cards. Applicant had a low paying job and over-\nextended himself. (Tr at 23; Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 4)  \n \nApplicant also filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 22, 1993. Approximately \n$5,000 in debts were discharged. In 1993, Applicant had credit card debt. He followed \nthe bad advice of an attorney to file for bankruptcy. (Tr at 24) \n \nApplicant has the following delinquent accounts: a $212 medical collection \naccount placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 5); a $1,039 account \nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 1); a $631 cell phone account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 1); a $494 credit card account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 6); a $978 credit card account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 1); a $706 account that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 2 at 1); \na $76 medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 2 at 1); and a $1,658 judgment. (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov \n3 at 4) \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $8,001 personal loan placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 2 at 1-2; Gov 3 at 7); a $4,006 credit card account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 3 at 7); a $16,800 debt owed as a result of a truck \nrepossession that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 3 at 8-9); an $877 account \nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 3 at 8); a $226 account placed for collection (SOR \n\u00b6 1.o: Gov 3 at 9); a $245 insurance account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 3 at \n9); and a $560 insurance account placed for collection. (SOR \u00b6 1.q: Gov 3 at 9) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant claims that he intends to take care all of \nhis bills. He has not been able to pay his bills in the past because he was only making \n$30,000 a year. His stepdaughter got married last year, and he and his wife are paying \nfor the costs of the wedding which was about $7,500. He and his wife purchased a \nhouse in June 2009 for $300,000. They paid about $10,000 as a down payment. \nApplicant discovered there were a lot of additional expenses when owning a home. The \nmortgage is in his wife\u2019s name only because of his poor credit. They keep their accounts \nseparate. He looked into financial counseling but never attended financial counseling. \n(Tr at  50, 54-55, 60) \n \nFrom 2002 to 2003, Applicant had several periods of unemployment. He was \nunemployed from March 2002 to September 2002. He was unemployed for a year in \n2003. His wife worked full-time. (Tr at 52-54; Gov 1)  \n \nThe current status of the delinquent accounts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $212 medical collection account: Applicant believes his insurance \ncompany should pay this debt, but decided that he is going to pay the debt. No proof \nwas provided that the debt was paid at the close of the record. The debt is unresolved. \n(Tr at 23) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $1,039 collection account: Applicant cannot determine who the \noriginal creditor is on this account. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 26)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $631 cell phone account placed for collection: Applicant admitted this \ndebt in his response to the SOR.  At the hearing, he disputed the debt. He claims he \nhad an account with the cell phone company about four years ago and he paid the \naccount. He claims he disputed the debt with the credit reporting agencies in the past \nand the debt was removed. He claims the credit reporting agencies put the debt back on \nhis credit report.  The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 27-28) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: $494 charged off account: Applicant admits this debt is still owed. The \ndebt is unresolved. (Tr at 28) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: $978 charged off credit card account: On December 1, 2009, \nApplicant agreed to a settlement. He agreed to settle the account for $400 in two \ninstallments of $200. The first payment was due on December 30, 2009.  The final \npayment is due on January 31, 2009.  The status of the debt is uncertain. (Tr at 29-30; \nAE H) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: $706 bank account that was overdrawn: Applicant settled this \naccount in late October 2009. (Tr at 30; AE G) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: $76 medical co-pay: Applicant intends to pay this debt by the end of \nthe year.  The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 30) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: $1,658 judgment for a personal loan: Appellant claims that he paid \n$300 towards this judgment. He does not have a regular payment plan. He was given \nthe opportunity to provide additional documents verifying payment after the hearing. He \ndid not submit any documents. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 31-32) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k ($8,001), 1.l ($4,006), and 1.m ($16,800), delinquent accounts with \nthe same credit union placed for collection: Applicant originally agreed to pay $100 per \nmonth towards each debt, a total of $300 a month. He made three payments in \nFebruary 2009, March 2009, and April 2009. He stopped making payments because he \nwas unable to afford the payments. He renegotiated the payment agreement and now \npays the credit union $100 per month for all three debts. His payments resumed in \nDecember 2009. (Tr at 32-40; Gov 4 at 6-8; AE I at 2; AE K at 2-4)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n:  $877 collection account: Applicant admits to owing this debt. There \nis no payment plan yet. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 40-41) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: $226 collection account: Debt was paid on April 23, 2009. (Tr at 41; \nAE A at 1) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: $245 insurance account placed for collection: The debt was paid in \nJuly 2009. (Tr at 41; AE A at 2)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q: $560 insurance account placed for collection: Applicant disputes this \naccount. He claims that he contacted the insurance company and they cannot find an \naccount in his name. The debt is unresolved. (Tr at 41-42; AE F) \n \nApplicant had several debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He paid off a \n$1,588 judgment owed to a bank on September 18, 2008. His wages were garnished to \nsatisfy the judgment and costs. He paid $4,000 towards this debt. (Tr at 38-40; AE 4 at \n5) Applicant owes taxes to the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2002 and 2003. \nHe is not sure how much he owes. He pays $205 a month pursuant to his agreement \nwith the Internal Revenue Service. He hopes to pay the debt in full by the end of the \nyear. (Tr at 43-44; Gov 4 at 14-15; AE J at 3-12)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $2,484. His wife\u2019s net monthly income is \n$2,800.  Their combined net monthly income is $5,284. Their mortgage payment is \n$1,781 (Their rent used to be $825). Other monthly expenses include: groceries $500, \nutilities $300, car payment $192, car insurance $200, cell phone $190, home phone \n$40, and clothing $50. Their total monthly expenses are $3,253.  Applicant and his wife \nhave $2,031 left over each month to apply towards their debts. Applicant\u2019s total monthly \ndebt payments were not discussed during the hearing. The total amount of the debt \npayments listed on a personal financial statement prepared by Applicant on February \n24, 2009, is $2,465. As mentioned previously, the $300 monthly payment to the credit \nunion has been reduced to $100 a month. Based on the evidence in the record and the \nreduced payment to the credit union, Applicant and his wife\u2019s monthly debt payments \n\n \n5 \n \n \nnow total $2,265.  If this information is accurate, they have a negative monthly balance \nof $434. (Tr at 45-51; Gov 4 at 4)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2008 performance review indicates that he met expectations. (AE B) \nThe security manager at Applicant\u2019s company states that he is very professional and \nresponsive to ideas presented to him. He is eager to learn and is an excellent asset to \nthe team. (AE J at 2) His supervisor in the mailroom from November 2005 to July 2008 \nstates that he is reliable and responsible. (AE C) Other co-workers have made similar \nfavorable statements about Applicant. (AE D; AE E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has had a long history of \nfinancial irresponsibility as evidenced by two Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges in 1993 \nand 2000, and his current financial situation. The SOR alleged 15 delinquent accounts, \nan approximate total balance of $36,509.   \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has had difficulty managing his finances for over 17 years. While he has \nresolved some accounts, numerous accounts remain unresolved. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated that he will be financially responsible in the future. Applicant\u2019s history of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfinancial irresponsibility raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies because Applicant has had \nsome periods of unemployment. He was out of work the entire year in 2003. However, \nApplicant has been employed full-time since 2004. There is no evidence that Applicant \nacted responsibly because the delinquent accounts are old and he took little action \ntowards resolving these accounts. I cannot conclude that it was a wise decision to \npurchase a new home, albeit in his wife\u2019s name, when Applicant had numerous \nunresolved debts. While circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to some \nof Applicant\u2019s financial problems, he has not acted responsibly with regard to his \nfinances after finding full-time employment. \n   \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant looked into credit counseling but did not attend \nclasses about properly managing his finances. While he has paid some accounts, and \nhas payment agreements with two creditors, it is unlikely Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nwill be resolved in the near future considering the extent of his unresolved debt.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.o, and 1.p. Most of his delinquent accounts remain unresolved. Partial credit is \ngiven to Applicant for entering into a repayment agreement with the credit union \nregarding the debts owed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m. However, he was unable to meet \nthe original terms of his repayment agreement after making two payments. He only \nrecently began making payments again in December 2009. It is too soon to conclude \nthat he will follow the terms of his repayment plan.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. While Applicant disputes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and \n1.d, he provided no documentation verifying the disputes and did not provide a \nsubstantiated basis for the dispute.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s two \nbankruptcy discharges in 1993 and 2000. I considered Applicant\u2019s periods of \nunemployment in 2002 and 2003. I considered that Applicant resolved some of his \ndelinquent accounts. However, a significant amount of delinquent debt remains. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to purchase a home rather than resolve his financial issues raises \nquestions about his judgment and reliability.  Despite two bankruptcy discharges, \nApplicant continued to incur delinquent debt. His long history of financial irresponsibility \nand the extent of his delinquent debt outweigh the steps Applicant has taken to resolve \nsome of his delinquent accounts. He did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations and did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nclearance decision.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant admitted five allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g.); denied four allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.h., and 1.i.), and offered additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) Applicant is 37 years old and employed as a network engineer by a government contractor. She is divorced and the custodial parent of two school-aged daughters. In 2004, she was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in criminal justice. She is pursuing part-time studies and hopes to earn a master\u2019s degree in forensic science. She has held a security clearance since 1994. (Ex. 1; Ex. K; Tr. 43-47, 84-85.) From 1994 until 2003, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. military. She was honorably discharged in 2003 as an E-6. (Ex. 1; Tr. 45-46.) Applicant married in 1996. Her husband was also in the U.S. military. Two daughters were born to the marriage, one in 1997 and the other in 2002. Applicant and her husband lived in a home they purchased near their military assignments. (Ex. 1; Ex. I, Tr. 32.) In 2005, Applicant was offered a job in another state.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 1, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. She elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 9, \n2009. A Notice of Hearing, setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for October 26, 2009, was issued \non September 18, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled to consider whether it is \nJanuary 14, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe government called no witnesses and introduced four exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 4 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified \non her own behalf and called no witnesses. She introduced seven exhibits, which were \nidentified and marked as follows: Ex. 1A, Ex. A, Ex. B, Ex. D, Ex. E, Ex. G, and Ex. H. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business on \nNovember 5, 2009, so that Applicant could, if she wished, provide additional information \nfor the record. Applicant filed three additional exhibits. Department Counsel did not \nobject to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions. I marked the post-hearing submissions \nas Applicant\u2019s Ex. I, Ex. J, and Ex. K, and they were admitted to the record. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on November 3, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains nine allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations. Applicant admitted five allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., \n1.f., and 1.g.); denied four allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.h., and 1.i.), and offered \nadditional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and employed as a network engineer by a government \ncontractor. She is divorced and the custodial parent of two school-aged daughters. In \n2004, she was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in criminal justice. She is \npursuing part-time studies and hopes to earn a master\u2019s degree in forensic science. She \nhas held a security clearance since 1994. (Ex. 1; Ex. K; Tr. 43-47, 84-85.) \n \n \nFrom 1994 until 2003, Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. military. She \nwas honorably discharged in 2003 as an E-6.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \nApplicant married in 1996. Her husband was also in the U.S. military. Two \ndaughters were born to the marriage, one in 1997 and the other in 2002. Applicant and \nher husband lived in a home they purchased near their military assignments. (Ex. 1; Ex. \nI, Tr. 32.) \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant was offered a job in another state. The employer offered \nApplicant a salary of $60,000 a year, an amount that doubled her existing salary. She \nand her husband discussed the job offer and decided that Applicant should accept it. \nShe and the children moved to the other state, while the husband stayed behind to fulfill \nhis military duties. In April 2005, Applicant and her husband purchased a home together \nin the new state. The property was secured by two mortgages: a first mortgage of \napproximately $300,000 and a home equity loan of approximately $75,000. The monthly \npayment on the first mortgage was $1,734. The monthly payment on the home equity \n\n \n3 \n \n \nloan was $524. The mortgage loans and monthly payments were based on Applicant\u2019s \nand her husband\u2019s combined incomes. (Ex. 2; Ex. H; Tr. 32-34, 50-51, 81-83.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband sold their home in State A, and the couple realized a profit \nof approximately $146,000. Applicant used approximately $11,000 from the sale as a \ndown payment on the second home, which had a purchase price of $375,000. \nApplicant\u2019s husband used the remaining proceeds for unidentified purposes. (Tr. 33-34.) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband planned for him to join the family in the new home in \nJanuary 2006. In July 2005, Applicant\u2019s husband came to visit her and the children in \nthe new home. He stated that he had a new love interest, wanted a divorce, and had no \nintention to return in January 2006.  He also refused to pay the mortgage on the new \nhome. He returned to the state where he and Applicant had previously resided and filed \nfor divorce. The divorce was final in July 2006. (Tr. 32-33, 51-52.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary was approximately $3,767. The two mortgage \npayments totaled approximately $2,250 each month. Applicant made the required \nmortgage payments for approximately two and a half years, until December 2007. She \ndid not receive child support during that time from her ex-husband. Applicant used her \ncredit cards to pay for other household expenses. She listed the property for sale or \nrent, but received no responses. (Ex. H; Tr. 33-34, 52-54.) \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant contacted the creditor holding the first mortgage and \nasked to deed the house back to the creditor. As the creditor suggested, she provided a \ndetailed list of her existing financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s ex-husband refused to \ncooperate in authorizing a quick or short sale of the property. The creditor moved to \nforeclose on the property. Applicant briefed her employer\u2019s security officers on her \nsituation and provided them with documentation corroborating her communications with \nthe creditor. By December 2007, Applicant could no longer pay the mortgages on the \nhouse and meet her other household and familial expenses. She vacated the property. \n(Ex. H; Tr. 53-55, 80-81.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.f. that the home equity loan of $73,000 had been \ncharged off and, as of May 15, 2009, had not been paid. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.h. that \nthe first mortgage of approximately $299,000 had been placed in foreclosure and had \nnot been paid as of May 15, 2009. At her hearing and in post-hearing submissions, \nApplicant provided credible testimony and documentation to establish that the property \nhad been foreclosed upon, sold at auction, and she did not owe a balance or remainder \non the loan. Applicant\u2019s documentation established that the property was sold at auction \non February 12, 2008, for $311,000, and the first mortgage loan of $300,000 was \nsatisfied. The second mortgage, a home equity loan for $73,000, remains unsatisified. \nApplicant provided a court order, entered June 18, 2008, but applicable nunc pro tunc to \nFebruary 6, 2008, establishing that the marital property \u201cshall be sold and the parties \n[Applicant and her ex-husband] shall share equally (50/50) in the proceeds or loss as a \nresult of the sale.\u201d (SOR; Ex. H; Ex. I; Tr. 60-63.)   \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant has attempted to contact the holder of the home equity loan. Because \nher ex-husband is the primary debtor on the home equity account, the holder of the loan \nwill not negotiate with her alone. She intends to continue her efforts to arrange a \npayment plan for her portion of the loan. If her efforts to arrange payment are not \nsuccessful, she intends to seek tax advice about claiming the entire amount as taxable \nincome. (Tr. 63-64.)  \n  \n \nDuring the two and a half years that she was paying the home mortgages and \nwas the sole support of her family, Applicant acquired approximately $28,000 in \ndelinquent debt. In response to DOHA interrogatories, she provided documentation to \nestablish that she had consolidated her debts and made monthly payments to satisfy \nher creditors. In addition to the home mortgage and the home equity loan, the SOR \nalleged seven financial delinquencies that totaled approximately $1,426. Five of the \nalleged delinquencies were medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.)  \nApplicant was not aware of the debts, which arose when her ex-husband dropped her \nfrom his health insurance. When made aware of the debts in March 2009, she followed \nthrough with payment, and she provided documentation to corroborate her statements \nthat the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e. had been satisfied. She was \nawaiting confirmation that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. had been satisfied. (Answer to \nSOR; Ex. 1A; Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. D; Ex. E; Tr. 35-37.)     \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate her statement that the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. had been settled in full as of August 21, 2009. She asserted that \nshe had disputed the $154 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i., and the creditor had told her the \ndebt was old and closed. She was unable to provide corroborating documentation by \nthe time the record closed. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 1A; Ex. G.) \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant was let go when her employer abolished her job. \nShe was immediately hired by another government contractor. Her current gross annual \nsalary is $72,300.  Her net monthly salary is $3,900, and she receives $752 each month \nin court-ordered child support from her ex-husband. Her total net monthly income is \n$4,652. (Tr. 38, 49, 65, 78-79.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fixed monthly expenses include the following: rent, $1,500; groceries, \n$400; clothing, $60; utilities, $205; child care, $400; debt consolidation payment, $514; \ncable and cell phone, $300; and gasoline, $120. In addition, Applicant pays $284 per \nmonth on her automobile loan, which will be paid in full in six months. (Ex. 3 at 6; Tr. 64-\n69.) \n \n \nApplicant is current on her state and federal income taxes. She has a savings \naccount, which contains about $350, and she has established a 401K account to save \nmoney for her retirement. Each month she deposits approximately $50 in each \ndaughter\u2019s individual savings account. She has no credit cards. She estimates that she \nhas a net monthly remainder of $400. (Tr. 64-74.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant is close to her parents and her brother, who provide her and her \nchildren with strong emotional support. When she served in the military, Applicant \nreceived financial counseling and also provided financial advice to the individuals she \nsupervised. She credited her parents with providing her with a strong sense of financial \nresponsibility. (Tr. 74-77.)   \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of her 2009 performance evaluation for the record.  \nApplicant\u2019s manager noted that even though she was new to the program and a recent \nhire, her work quality, timeliness of delivery, use of resources, and work habits \nconsistently exceeded expectations. (Ex. K.) \n \n \n                                                 Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent mortgage debt and \nwas unable to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted financial delinquencies related to a mortgage loan and a \nhome equity loan on a home she and her husband purchased together in 2005. \nAdditionally, she was responsible for a number of smaller medical and consumer loans \nwhich she acquired after her husband abandoned the marriage, refused to pay his \nshare of the home mortgage and home equity loans, and failed to provide child support \nfor his two young daughters who were living with Applicant.  \n \nApplicant tried to sell or rent the property. While she contacted the mortgage \nlender and requested assistance in meeting her mortgage obligation, her ex-husband \nrefused to authorize a short or quick sale and the lender initiated foreclosure \nproceedings. Eventually, the property was foreclosed upon. \n \n Applicant is 37 years old. She is resourceful and responsible. She sought \nassistance from her lender, and she kept her employer\u2019s security officers fully informed \nof the financial difficulties arising from her inability to pay her home mortgage, her home \nequity loan, and her daily living expenses. Additionally, she sought to consolidate her \nconsumer loans, and she has consistently made monthly payments to reduce the debt \nshe acquired when her husband divorced her and failed to meet his financial obligations \nto her and their children.    \n \n Applicant has learned, through experience, some hard personal and financial \nlessons. She has also acknowledged her financial responsibilities and has made good-\nfaith efforts to satisfy her creditors. She continues to work to resolve her financial \nobligations. When faced with an unexpected divorce and financial consequences that \nwere largely beyond her control, she acted responsibly under the circumstances. The \ncircumstances that caused Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are unlikely to recur and \ndo not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply in mitigation to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply in this case. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant possesses skills and \nabilities that have been valued by her employers. She has held a security clearance, \nwithout incident, since 1994. Her financial problems began when her husband \nabandoned the marriage, filed for divorce, refused to pay his share of the mortgages on \ntheir joint marital property, and failed to fulfill his obligation to support his children. \nApplicant responded to this setback with energy and determination. She attempted to \nrent or sell the marital property. She realized the security implications of her financial \ndifficulty, and she kept her employer\u2019s security personnel informed of her financial \nsituation. She acted in good faith to meet her financial obligations. I observed Applicant \ncarefully at her hearing, and I assessed her credibility. I have no doubt that she will \nhonor any legal financial obligations that arise from the unsatisfied home equity loan for \nwhich she and her ex-husband are equally responsible. I believe it is highly unlikely that \nin the future she will fail to carry out any of the responsibilities of a person entrusted with \na security clearance and the protection of classified information. I conclude that she is \nnot a security risk. \n \nApplicant is a serious and responsible person. She is currently living within her \nmeans and paying attention to her financial obligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance, and I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n                    FOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:          For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is   \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a through 1.e, 1.g, and 1.l. She denied the remaining SOR allegations. Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She served in the United States Army (USA) from May 1997 until June 2000. She has held a security clearance since 1997. Applicant has been with her current employer since April 2008. (GE 1) Applicant\u2019s first marriage in 1992 occurred when she was 17-years-old. She has two children from that marriage. Her husband physically abused their daughter which caused brain damage. As a result of this abuse, Applicant divorced her husband in 1999. (GE 3) She could not divorce him sooner as he was in jail, and she could not afford the divorce. She had no income as she was home caring for her children. Applicant never received any financial support from her ex-husband. (Tr.14) Applicant married her second husband while she was in the military. That marriage ended in 2001, partly as a result of the separations that occurred during their military service. They decided to end their marriage amicably after less than two years.

Applicant testified and presented three exhibits, which were admitted without\nobjection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-C. I kept the record open until September 30,\n2010, for Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted three\nadditional documents, which were accepted into the record and marked as AE D-F.\nOctober 20, 2010\n\n2\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 23, 2010. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.e, 1.g, and 1.l. She denied the remaining SOR allegations. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She served in the\nUnited States Army (USA) from May 1997 until June 2000. She has held a security\nclearance since 1997. Applicant has been with her current employer since April 2008.\n(GE 1)\nApplicant\u2019s first marriage in 1992 occurred when she was 17-years-old. She has\ntwo children from that marriage. Her husband physically abused their daughter which\ncaused brain damage. As a result of this abuse, Applicant divorced her husband in\n1999. (GE 3) She could not divorce him sooner as he was in jail, and she could not\nafford the divorce. She had no income as she was home caring for her children.\nApplicant never received any financial support from her ex-husband. (Tr.14) \nApplicant married her second husband while she was in the military. That\nmarriage ended in 2001, partly as a result of the separations that occurred during their\nmilitary service. They decided to end their marriage amicably after less than two years.\n(Tr. 44)\nIn 2004, Applicant married her third husband. They purchased a home using her\nVA home loan benefits. (Tr. 33) In 2006, while Applicant was in Iraq working for a\ncontractor, her husband lived in the family home. She made arrangements to have the\nmortgage paid by automatic pay deduction. When she returned home in 2007, they\nseparated. Her husband stayed in the home, and he agreed to pay the mortgage.\nHowever, he did not pay the mortgage. She did not know about any foreclosure. Their\ndivorce finalized in 2009. \nWhen Applicant left the family home in 2007, she incurred more expenses for an\napartment and other daily expenses. She also had student loans totaling $3,000. She\nhad payment arrangements for the student loans, which are now paid in full. \nThe SOR alleges eleven delinquent debts, including medical accounts, a\njudgment, and a home foreclosure in 2008. The approximate total for Applicant\u2019s debts\nis $7,895, excluding the foreclosure (GE 6). \nThe debts alleged in the SOR that Applicant admitted, have been paid in full. She\nprovided documentation for each account. (AE A-F) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for a\ncredit card for $20 was disputed. Applicant contacted the company and was notified that\nthere was no balance owing. (Tr. 27)\n\n3\nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i because it was paid in March 2009. She\nprovided documentation for proof of payment when she completed DOHA\ninterrogatories. (GE 2)\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j was not her debt. Applicant\u2019s estranged spouse\npaid the bill, which was for his son\u2019s high school. (Tr. 31) She provided documentation\nthat this account has been paid with her answer to the SOR. (File) SOR \u00b6 1.k is a\nduplicate account of 1.j. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l was the result of Applicant\u2019s home mortgage account that went into\nforeclosure without her knowledge in 2008. Her estranged husband remained in the\nhouse, but did not make the monthly mortgage payments. When Applicant left the\nhome, the mortgage was current. (Tr. 36) She had every reason to believe that he\nwould pay the mortgage. Applicant was living in another state at the time. She admits\nher indebtedness and did not shirk from her obligation. The home was purchased using\nher VA guaranteed home loan. (GE 4) The foreclosure process was completed in April\n2009. When the house was sold for less than the amount owed, which was $48,000, the\nVA covered the difference. (AE B) The account shows a zero balance.\nWhen Applicant received the SOR, she had already been making payments on\nthe debts alleged, some as early as 2008. She obtained her credit report and\nresearched the remaining debts. The judgment, that was the result of an apartment\nrental default in 2003, was paid in 2005. She received financial counseling as part of a\nroutine training program while on active duty. (Tr. 21). Applicant\u2019s current monthly net\nincome is approximately $3,841. (GE 2) She is current with her monthly expenses. She\nhas no credit cards. She has no car payment. Her net monthly remainder is\napproximately $1,000. She has a savings account. \nAt the hearing, Applicant was forthright and candid about her struggle with debt\nover the years as a single parent. She supported her children with no child support. She\nhas worked since 1997, but earned less than it cost to support her family. (Tr. 14) She\nacknowledges that, at times, she had to accept food stamps and other government aid.\nShe joined the military to improve her employment opportunities. She worked in Iraq in\n2006 to make more money for her family. \nWhen she returned home, she learned that her husband had not paid the bills\nand that one of her creditors had sued, resulting in a judgment. Her salary was\ndeposited into a joint account and her husband was responsible for the payment of bills.\n(Tr. 14) He did not act responsibly.\nIn 2010, Applicant worked in Afghanistan to earn money to alleviate the financial\ndifficulties that her third husband had exacerbated. With the extra income, Applicant\npaid her delinquent debts. She was passionate at the hearing about her patriotism and\nloyalty to the United States. She acknowledged that she is now earning more money\nthat she ever had, and when she was in great financial difficulty, she never\n\n4\ncompromised her access to classified information. (Tr. 17) She has never lived beyond\nher means.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on various accounts and\nhad a 2008 foreclosure. Her credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be\nmitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ She acknowledged\nher delinquent debts from 2003. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s home foreclosure was beyond her control. She\nacted responsibly while deployed with automatic mortgage payments. When she\nseparated and left the family home, her husband agreed to pay the mortgage. He did\nnot. She was living in another state and had no knowledge of default on the mortgage.\nShe has resolved her delinquent debts. They are paid in full. She consistently showed\nreliability. Also, she is now in a stable financial situation. Applicant consistently acted\nresponsibly in paying her debts. Her separation and divorce exacerbated her financial\ndifficulties. She was the sole support of her family. As soon as Applicant learned about\nher debts, she began paying them. She addressed the foreclosure when she learned\nabout it. This mitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\n\n6\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received financial counseling when she was in the\nmilitary. Applicant has a history of good-faith efforts in paying bills. She has resolved her\ndelinquent debts. She has sufficient income to pay her bills. Her efforts are sufficient to\ncarry her burden in this case. I conclude these mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge must consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the Government\u2019s case. Applicant served in the military from 1997 until 2000.\nShe held a security clearance during her service without incident. She has provided for\nher two children as a single parent. She has worked hard to keep her family together.\nApplicant\u2019s first marriage caused her much suffering. Her daughter was\nphysically abused. She could not work when the children were young. Her husband was\nimprisoned. She joined the military to help improve her situation. She deployed to Iraq.\nUnfortunately, her second marriage was not successful. At the hearing, Applicant was\ncandid that she has struggled with finances. However, her third husband created\ngreater financial difficulties for her when he did not make the mortgage payments on the\nfamily home. This was not the fault of Applicant. She had no idea when they separated\nthat he would not pay the mortgage. When Applicant learned about the debts and the\nforeclosure, she acted with resolve. Her delinquent accounts are paid. There is no\nbalance owing on the mortgage account. She was candid and forthright at the hearing\nabout her future and her past mistakes. She supports her family. She has been divorced\nsince 2009. She is now stable and able to work in a position that will render her\nfinancially solvent.\n\n7\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 29, 2009.

Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nGE 1; Tr. 21, 28, 43.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 21, 35-36.\n3\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request on May 29, 2009. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on June 9, 2009, and I received the case assignment on June 11,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 29, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on July 23, 2009. The government offered five exhibits (GE) 1 through 5,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf. He submitted nine exhibits (AE) A through I, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on July 31, 2009. I held the record open until August 14, 2009, for Applicant to\nsubmit additional matters. He timely submitted three exhibits, AE J through AE L,\nwithout objection. Applicant also submitted four additional exhibits, AE M through AE P\non August 19, 2009. Department Counsel objected to the admission of these\ndocuments because the documents were submitted after the close of the record.\nAlthough Applicant did not request additional time, Department Counsel has not\narticulated how the government would be prejudiced by the admission of these records.\nThe Department Counsel\u2019s objection is overruled and AE M through AE P are admitted\ninto the record. The record closed on August 24, 2009, the date Department Counsel\nfiled the objection to Applicant\u2019s last submission.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\n1.d, and 1.f - 1.j of the SOR. He denied the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.e of the SOR.1\nApplicant, who is 45 years old, works in information technology (IT) support and\nsystem analysis for a Department of Defense contractor. He has worked in this position\nsince June 2004. He retired from the United States Navy as an E-6 in September 2003.\nApplicant held a secret clearance without incident during his 21 years of Naval service.2\nApplicant graduated from high school and earned college credits, but no degree.\nHe married in 1986. He and his wife separated in late 2005 and their divorce became\nfinal in August 2009. Applicant has five children from his marriage. He has two\ndaughters, ages 22 and 14, and three sons, ages 20, 19 and 16. His older daughter\ngraduated from college in May 2009. His two oldest sons are in college. His youngest\nson and younger daughter live with their mother.3\n\nAE O; Tr. 22.\n4\nAE O; Tr. 23, 36-37.\n5\nTr. 33, 45, 55-57.\n6\n3\nAbout six months after he and his wife separated, Applicant\u2019s wife presented him\nwith a separation agreement. He initially declined to sign it. When he continued to\nrefuse to sign it, his wife threatened to move and take his children away from him. He\nsigned the separation agreement, and then he met with an attorney.4\nUnder the terms of the separation agreement, Applicant assumed all the marital\ndebts. He agreed to pay $550 a month on the mortgage until the house is sold, which\nwill not occur until his youngest child reaches age 18, and $1,129 a month in child\nsupport. Under the child support guidelines, the child support decreases when a child\nreaches 18. Applicant agreed to pay, as a stipend to the newly emancipated child, the\ndifference between the child support guidelines payment and $1,129. When his oldest\ndaughter reached 18, his monthly child support obligation declined by $100 a month. He\nthen paid this amount to his oldest daughter. He made similar payments to his two older\nsons, who are now emancipated. He also paid the health insurance premiums for his\nchildren until age 23 or working full-time, and 50% of their college education costs\n(tuition, room and board, and books).5\nBy late summer in 2006, Applicant encountered financial difficulties with paying\nall his bills. In December 2006 and early 2007, Applicant contacted a debt consolidation\ncompany. The company required him to take a financial counseling course prior to\nenrolling him in their program. After carefully reviewing the terms of his contract with this\ncompany, Applicant decided not to retain the company\u2019s services because its fees were\nextremely high. As his bills increased, Applicant spoke with an attorney on several\noccasions about filing bankruptcy. By early 2008, he had decided to file a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy petition as he wanted to pay his debts. His attorney required him to take a\ndebt management course. He planned to file the bankruptcy action after his divorce\nhearing in May 2008. However, his wife requested and received a continuance of the\nhearing. She successfully continued the divorce hearing three more times. Her actions\nsignificantly increased his attorney fees.6\nTwo creditors filed garnishment actions against Applicant. Thus, as a result, he\npaid two debts through garnishment. When his final divorce hearing continued to be\ndelayed, Applicant again contacted a debt consolidation company in February 2009. He\ndecided to retain the services of this company. He initially thought that the company\nwould contact his creditors and establish a payment plan for each. He learned that he\nwas incorrect. Under this company\u2019s plan, Applicant pays $328 a month. For the first\nfour months, the company retained $190 for administrative and maintenance fees and\nplaced the remaining money in a savings account. After four months, the company\nretained $148 for these fees, and after 20 months, the company will retain only $19.50 a\nmonth for maintenance fees. The company holds Applicant\u2019s money and contacts his\n\nAE H; AE I; Tr. 24-26, 56-57, 60.\n7\nGE 2, at 8; Tr. 29-33.\n8\nGE 2; Tr. 34-42.\n9\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated June 4, 2009); GE 4 (Credit report, dated April 7, 2009); GE 5 (Credit report, dated\n10\nAugust 9, 2008); AE N (Credit report, dated July 24, 2009).\nApplicant disagrees with the amount of this debt, but has not filed a formal dispute.\n11\n4\ncreditors when it believes the creditors will accept a settlement of 40% or 50% of the\ndebt. Applicant began his payments to this company in February 2009 and since then\nhe has made the payment every month. At the time of the hearing, his savings account\ntotaled $891. The debt consolidation company had not paid any of his debts.7\nApplicant works four jobs. He works 40 hours a week for the Department of\nDefense contractor. He earns $65,000 a year. He works one day a week cleaning\nhouses, earning $150 a week, and 15-20 hours a week delivering pizza, earning $300\nto $400 a month. From Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, he  cleans\nrental property, earning $250 a week. He receives $450 a month in retirement benefits.\nHis wife receives $720 a month of his retirement benefit, which includes  medical and\ndental insurance payments. His gross monthly income in the summer is approximately\n$7,350 and his estimated net income is $4,900. His net monthly income decreased in\nthe winter.8\nApplicant\u2019s monthly living expenses include $600 for rent, $300 for a truck\npayment, $100 for truck insurance; $100 for gasoline, $100 for a time share, $300 for\nfood, $25 for telephone, and $328 for debt repayment. In addition to his regular monthly\nliving expenses, Applicant pays $1,129 in child support or stipend payments, $550 in\nalimony (mortgage to wife), and $1,000 for college expenses. Applicant did not estimate\nother expenses such as car repairs, clothing, haircuts, dry cleaning, and small living\nexpenses, which I find average $150 a month. His monthly expenses total $4,682.\nApplicant does not have any additional money at the end of the month.   \n9\nAfter reviewing the credit reports dated August 9, 2008, April 7, 2009, June 4,\n2009, and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total debts owed, excluding any\nduplicate entries. I find that Appellant\u2019s actual debts are as follows:10\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS\nEVIDENCE\n1.a\nJudgment\n$2,144.00\nPaid\nAE G; Tr. 9, 46-47\n1.b\nJudgment\n$3,726.00\nPayment plan\nAE H; Tr. 48.\n11\n1.c\nUtility bill\n$   437.00\nPayment plan\nAE H; Tr. 49\n1.d\nJewelry store\n$   504.00\nPaid\nAE H; AE M\n\nGE 2; AE K; Tr. 41-42.\n12\nAE L.\n13\nAE B; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE F.\n14\n5\n1.e\nCredit card\n$   126.00\nPaid\nGE 2; AE J; Tr. 51\n1.f\nCar repairs\n$2,607.00\nPayment plan\nAE H; Tr. 52 \n1.g\nCredit card\n$6,550.00\nPayment plan\nAE H; Tr. 52-53\n1.h\nCredit card  \n$4,923.00\nPayment plan\nAE H; Tr. 52-53\n1.i\nStore account\n$3,013.00\nPayment plan\nAE H; Tr. 53\n1.j\nStore account\n$3,284.00\nPayment plan\nAE H; Tr. 53\nApplicant paid two other debts, totaling $2,658, prior to the issuance of the SOR.\nHis truck was repossessed in January 2007. He regained possession of his truck after\npaying the overdue balance. He has also paid his attorney over $10,000 to represent\nhim in his divorce. He still owes his attorney $5,000. He pays his attorney periodically,\nwhen he has enough money for a meaningful payment. He paid his attorney $1,500 in\nMay 2009.12\nApplicant appeared in court on July 30, 2009 for his divorce hearing. He\nanticipated that he would receive household furniture, which he could sell to pay debts.\nHe did not. The court concluded that the stipend payable to his children when they\nreached age 18 was unenforceable. The court did not specifically articulate how his\nchild support payments would change. In the future, he will pay child support for two\nchildren, which should provide him with additional funds.13\nWhile in the Navy, Applicant received two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement\nMedals, two National Defense Service Medals, and multiple other medals, ribbons, and\ncommendations. Upon his retirement, his Commanding Officer wrote a glowing\nemployment letter of recommendation, highlighting his work skills, both managerial and\norganizational, and his dedication to duty. He opined that Applicant was completely\ntrustworthy. His current supervisor and second level supervisor also praised his work\nskills and work ethic. They also opined that he is trustworthy.14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n7\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guidelines note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt following his divorce. He has\nbeen unable to repay some his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems began in 2006, shortly after he and his wife separated. His financial\nproblems continue. This mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose when he and his wife separated and he signed a separation\nagreement, which placed heavy financial burdens on him. When it became apparent\nthat his debts were unmanageable, he sought assistance from debt consolidation\ncompanies. He also considered filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He rejected several\nconsolidation company service contracts because their fees were excessive. As he\ncould, he paid his debts. Since signing the separation agreement, he has complied with\nthe payment terms outlined in it. In February 2009, he finally decided to retain a debt\nconsolidation  company and against filing bankruptcy. He has acted reasonably under\nthe circumstances. He has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6\n20(b).\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Through the first consolidation company he\ncontacted, he participated in credit counseling before he decided not to use its services.\nHis bankruptcy attorney also required him to take a debt management course. His debts\nare being resolved and his finances are under control. This mitigating condition applies. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant hired\na debt management company eight months ago for the purpose of helping him resolve\nhis debts. His unpaid debts are included in the plan with this company. He has complied\n\n8\nwith the terms of this agreement. The company paid one small debt recently. Applicant\nalso paid several debts prior to receiving the SOR. He works four jobs in an effort to pay\nhis bills. I conclude this mitigating condition applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching this conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nsigned a separation agreement without first talking to an attorney. As a result, he\nincurred additional bills. In a short time, his debts increased significantly, as he lacked\nsufficient income. For the last three years, despite the egregious terms of the separation\nagreement, Applicant has made the payments required. He recognized that the income\nfrom his full-time job and his retirement benefit would not be sufficient to pay his\nobligations under the separation agreement and his usual living expenses. He obtained\ntwo part-time jobs, which he continues to work. In the summer, he works a fourth job to\nhelp meet his significant expenses. Applicant has been honest about his debts and his\nactions to resolve them. He has not avoided his debts; rather, he has paid those he can\nand sought a way to resolve the remaining debts. By working several jobs, Applicant\nhas demonstrated his intent to assume responsibility for his debts, not avoid them. Most\n\n9\nsignificantly, he has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent\ndebts that raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) His obligations under the\nseparation agreement limit how quickly he can resolve his debts. Even though debts\nremain unpaid, his debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course,\nthe issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid: it is whether his financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. The SOR\nlists ten debts, totaling less than $25,000. He paid three debts and the remaining seven\ndebts are in an established payment plan. His financial problems do not raise security\nconcerns. He has demonstrated responsibility and integrity in the management of the\nfinancial situation created by his divorce. His track record reflects financial stability and\ndebt resolution. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn February 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 26, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 30, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 5, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled \non June 2, 2009.

In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and has been employed as a systems analyst for a \nfederal contractor since January 2006. She has been married since 1981 and has two \nchildren, ages 24 and 17. Both live at home. Applicant graduated from college in 2003, \nearning a Bachelor of Science degree. Her husband is a realtor.1  \n \nThe SOR reflects two debts that are past due. The debt in SOR 1.a is a \ndelinquent mortgage debt ($53,713). Applicant and her husband bought a house in \n2003 based on their two incomes. She was earning around $40,000 annually at the \ntime. Due to the real estate market decline Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s income was reduced \nfrom approximately $50,000 a year in 2005 to approximately $38,000 in 2006 and \n$23,000 in 2007. The reduction in income affected the couple\u2019s ability to pay their \nmortgage. Their mortgage payments were approximately $3,800 a month. They \ndepleted their savings while trying to make their mortgage payments. In March 2006 \nthey were unable to pay their mortgage payment and defaulted. They had been in \ncontact with their mortgage company while their financial situation was changing and \nwhen they defaulted they contacted their mortgage company again, so they could work \nout a payment plan that would benefit both sides.2  \n \nIn January 2006 Applicant was hired by her current employer and her salary \nincreased to approximately $60,000. She was promoted in January 2009 and her \ncurrent salary is $88,000. Her husband continued to work in real estate, but his earnings \ncontinued to decrease. He worked from 2006 to 2009 for his realty employer, but in the \npast three months changed jobs. He also began working at a part-time retail job in \nOctober 2007.3  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 in April 2007 in his \nname only. The payment plan included their joint mortgage, an investment property, \nthree credit card debts and his car that was repossessed. He made monthly payments \nof $2,000 into the plan for nine months until the debts were discharged.4  \n \n1 Tr. 21-25, 100-101. \n \n2 Tr. 18-20, 25-39, 57-66, 92-100. \n \n3 Tr. 26-29, 59-65. \n \n4 Tr. 30-36. All the debts except the mortgage were in Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s name. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant attempted to find a resolution to their mortgage default as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. In October 2008 she and her husband began the paperwork to modify their \nmortgage. The paperwork took 60 to 90 days to complete. In January 2009 they were \nnotified by the mortgage company that they had lost their paperwork so they had to \nresubmit the information and it took another 60 to 90 days to complete the modification. \nIn May 2009 their mortgage was modified and the total amount of the loan increased, \nwhich included all of their arrearages and costs. This new mortgage provided for a \nreduced interest rate. The modification requires monthly payments of $4,029. The first \npayment is due July 1, 2009. Applicant testified that she and her husband have \nsufficient income to make their monthly payments.5 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.b is a credit card ($99) that was past due on a balance of \n($978). Applicant has two credit cards with the retailer and provided proof that she is \npaying both on time and neither is past due.6  \n \nApplicant appears to have resolved the issues related to the delinquent debts in \nSOR 1.a and 1.b. She provided a budget, but it did not include the payments she is \nmaking toward her student loans ($148/month, total owed $23,000) and her quarterly \nlife insurance payment ($160). Applicant has seven to eight credit cards that have a \ntotal balance of $15,000 that she is making payments on. She continues to use these \ncredit cards. Most of her credit card debt appears to be over her limit or close to her \nmaximum limit. In 2005, she and her husband refinanced their home and took out \napproximately $54,000 in equity to pay a federal tax lien from the mid-1980s and a \nbusiness tax lien associated with her husband for failing to have enough money \nwithheld. She stated they had paid their taxes, but they could not prove it because they \ndid not retain their files. Applicant testified that their taxes are paid.7 Their investment \nproperty was included in the bankruptcy and in August 2009 the arrearages on that \nproperty will be caught up. The $1,600 payment for the property will be reduced to $600 \nat that time, allowing for additional expendable income. During the period when \nApplicant\u2019s husband was making payments into the Chapter 13 payment plan, some of \nthe payment was going toward their home mortgage to prevent foreclosure. The amount \npaid was less than their mortgage payment. Applicant lists that she has $7,000 in their \nchecking account and no other savings. Applicant testified she and her husband are \ntrying to make changes in their lifestyle and realign their expenditures.8  \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified and took responsibility for his actions that affected \nthe family\u2019s finances, such as his business tax lien.  \n \n5 Tr. 41-43; AE C. \n \n6 Tr. 44-50; GE 3 page 2; AE D and E. \n \n7 Applicant testified that they had approximately $90,000 in equity in the house. \n \n8 Tr. 50-100; GE 2 and 4. Applicant and her husband\u2019s tax lien and her husband\u2019s business tax \nlien were not considered for disqualifying purposes, nor was her overall credit card history. However, \nthese matters were considered when analyzing Applicant\u2019s financial practices, ability to pay her debts and \nher credibility under the whole person section. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \n \nApplicant was unable to pay her mortgage and another debt that was past due. \nShe and her husband earned sufficient incomes, even though his was reduced due to a \nfinancial market downturn. Based on the evidence, there is sufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant and her husband were living beyond their means and unable to \npay their mortgage debt. I find the above disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because she and her husband have a new \nmortgage they recently refinanced and will start making their new monthly payments \nbeginning on July 1, 2009. Rolled into their new mortgage payment are their arrearages. \nI find mitigating condition (a) does not apply because the debt is still in its earliest \nstages of resolution and the first payment has not been made. Applicant and her family \nrelied on two incomes when they obtained the mortgage. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s income \nas a realtor was reduced due to the economic market. This was a condition beyond her \ncontrol. Her husband\u2019s failure to pay his business taxes and their failure to pay their \nfederal taxes on time affected their total financial situation. Earlier they were able to \nrefinance their home and take $54,000 from it, but needed that money to pay their past \ntaxes. This in turn affected their ability to use this money to pay their mortgage later. It \nappears Applicant\u2019s husband was handling the finances; however, Applicant was also \ncontributing to the family debt. I find under the circumstances mitigating condition (b) \nonly partially applies because some of the tax problems was within Applicant\u2019s control, \neven though the decrease in income was not. To Applicant\u2019s credit, she and her \nhusband have been working with the mortgage company throughout the period when \nhis income was reduced. They have continued to work with them and have negotiated a \nnew mortgage that includes paying their arrearages.  \n \n \nApplicant provided proof that she is current on the credit card debt that was \nalleged. There is no evidence Applicant has received any financial counseling. \nHowever, there is a clear indication that she is resolving her mortgage delinquency and \ninitiated a good-faith effort to address the problem as it was occurring. Applicant \nprovided proof that she is current on the credit card debt alleged. She provided \nsufficient evidence to show the allegation is resolved. Therefore, I find mitigating \ncondition (c) and (d) apply.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant and her husband \nexperienced financial problems when his income was reduced. They refinanced their \nhome to pay overdue tax liens that in turn affected their ability to use this money when \nthe market downturn reduced her husband\u2019s income. Applicant has resolved the two \ndebts alleged in the SOR. Her husband is working full-time and has a part-time job. \nApplicant has a significant number of credit cards that are at or close to their maximum \nlimits and is meeting her monthly payments. Although Applicant did not file for \nbankruptcy, her husband did and she benefited from it. At this time, Applicant appears \nto have her finances in order and is paying her bills. She and her husband seem to have \ntheir finances back on tract, but obviously need to be committed to long term changes in \ntheir spending habits. I find the record evidence does not leave me with questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from Financial \nConsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Personal conduct concerns are mitigated; however, financial \nconsiderations concerns remain. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 25, 2008 and July 30, 2008, Applicant submitted Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance applications \n(SF-86s) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1; GE 2). On March 5, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 8). On May 6, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed. On May 7, 2009, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me. On June 5, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on \nJune 30, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 22-23), and Applicant offered three exhibits (Tr. 113-117, 121-122, 124; \nAE A-C). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 23), and AE A-C (Tr. \n117, 124). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the \nSOR (GE 6-8). After the hearing, Applicant provided ten exhibits (AE D-M). Department \nCounsel did not object and I admitted the ten exhibits (AE D-M). I received the transcript \non July 9, 2009. I closed the record on July 15, 2009.      \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with \nexplanations (GE 8). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). He \ngraduated from high school in 1999 (Tr. 7). In college, he majored in information \nscience and systems (Tr. 7). He graduated from college in 2005 (Tr. 7). He has held a \nsecret clearance since April 2008 (Tr. 8). He has never been married and does not have \nany children (Tr. 26). He does not have any prior military service (Tr. 27). He began \nworking for the defense contractor in April 2008 (Tr. 25). \n \nSummary of SOR debts \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($7,312)\u2014Unresolved. Applicant said this was an education loan (Tr. \n28). The account became delinquent in 2008, and he said he began making payments \nin 2009 (Tr. 28-29). He thought the monthly payment was $150 (Tr. 31). He said he was \nsure he made at least one payment (Tr. 32). However, he did not provide proof of any \npayments. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,213)\u2014Paid. A letter, dated July 2, 2009, indicated this credit card \ndebt in the amount of $905 was paid (Tr. 34-40; GE 4 at 3; AE F; AE L; AE M).   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,603)\u2014Unresolved. This is an education loan (Tr. 34, 40). He said \nthe creditor offered to settle the debt for two, $250 payments and that he made the two \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npayments (Tr. 41-43). I conclude he was confused about this settlement offer. He did \nnot make any payments to this creditor in the last six months. \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($635)\u2014Unresolved. This is a medical debt (Tr. 43). He said he paid \nthis bill in February or March 2009 (Tr. 45). He paid using funds from his checking \naccount (Tr. 46). He said he had documentation to support his claim of payment and \nwould provide it to me (Tr. 46-48). However, he did not provide any post-hearing proof \nof payments on this particular medical debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,045)\u2014Paid. This is a credit card debt (Tr. 49; GE 4 at 4). \nApplicant\u2019s payment plan promised $240 payments in March, April and May 2009 (Tr. \n49-51, 60; GE 8 at 6). His creditor\u2019s letter, dated July 2, 2009, confirmed payment of this \ndebt (AE G; AE K; AE L; AE M). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($18,065)\u2014Unresolved. On January 20, 2009, he paid $265, and on \nMarch 16, 2009, he paid $265 (AE L; AE M). At the hearing, he said he discussed \npayment arrangements of $150 a month; however, he did not make any $150 payments \n(Tr. 51-53). He has not made any payments in the 90 days preceding his hearing. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($157), 1.h ($142), 1.i ($274), and 1.j ($153)\u2014Paid. These four \nmedical debts are owed to the same creditor (GE 4 at 9; GE 5 at 8-9). Applicant made a \n$116 payment on March 20, 2009 (Tr. 48; GE 8 at 9, 10), and a $116 payment on May \n27, 2009 (AE I). He thought he had paid these four debts because they were to the \nsame creditor (Tr. 53-57, 62-63). He asked the creditor if any more money was due and \nwas advised he did not owe any more money (Tr. 53-54). The creditor wrote Applicant \nand promised to correct his credit report on two of the debts (GE 8 at 8-10).    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($188)\u2014Unresolved. This is a telecommunications debt (Tr. 58). He \nwas unsure about whether he had paid this debt (Tr. 58). If he had paid it, it was in \nFebruary 2009 (Tr. 59). He averred that if he paid it, he could provide supporting \ndocumentation (Tr. 59). He did not provide any post-hearing documentation on this \ndebt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($425)\u2014Paid. Applicant paid $205 on May 13, 2009, and $278 on \nJanuary 6, 2009, bringing his utilities to current status (Tr. 64-67; AE J, AE L; AE M).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history for the previous four years and personal financial \nstatement \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from 2005 to 2007 was about $35,000 to $37,000 per \nyear (Tr. 81). Starting around 2007, he was unemployed or underemployed for about \nten months (Tr. 81). During the summer of his unemployment period, he received $8 an \nhour working as a teacher\u2019s aid for children ages three to five years old (Tr. 83). He did \nnot receive unemployment benefits (Tr. 81). During his unemployment, he attended \nschool and received financial support from his parents (Tr. 81). In April 2008, he began \nhis current employment (Tr. 25, 81). His current annual salary is $58,900 (Tr. 78). He \nhas not received a raise since he started his current employment (Tr. 79).  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant\u2019s net pay after deductions is $3,160 (Tr. 88). In his savings and \nchecking accounts combined, he has about $300 (Tr. 89). He does not have any other \nfinancial assets (Tr. 89). His monthly expenses are: rent ($1,110); car payment ($350) \n(he purchased a 2003 Ford in February 2009); car insurance ($165); gasoline ($50); \nschool loan ($597);2 food ($130); utilities ($200); cable ($180); and cell phone ($150) \n(Tr. 92-101). Applicant essentially lives paycheck-to-paycheck, and only has $200 a \nmonth remaining after expenses (Tr. 101). He reduced his federal tax withholding so he \nwould have additional funds to pay his debts (Tr. 102). He also cashed in some of his \nvacation time and used it for debt payment. His most recent tax refund in 2008 was \nabout $1,500, which he used to purchase the 2003 Ford (Tr. 103). \n \nApplicant agreed to provide documentation after his hearing showing (1) his \ncurrent pay; (2) payment status and arrangements for all SOR debts; (3) the relationship \nbetween the medical receipts and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j; (4) any \ndocumentation showing SOR debts were paid or settled and paid; and (5) monthly \naccount statements for six months with notations showing applicability to particular SOR \ndebts (Tr. 121-122; AE C). After his hearing, Applicant provided records showing the \nfollowing payments on his SOR debts: \n \nDate \nAmount \nSOR \u00b6 \nReference \nJuly 1, 2009 \n$597 \nStudent Loan \nAE I at 3 \nMay 27, 2009 \n$116 \nMedical Debt \nAE J at 2 \nMay 13, 2009 \n$205 \nUtility Debt-\u00b6 1.l \nAE J at 4 \nApril 13, 2009 \n$240 \n\u00b6 1.f \nAE K at 1 \nMarch 31, 2009 \n$240 \n\u00b6 1.f \nAE L at 5 \nMarch 23, 2009 \n$116 \nMedical Debt \nAE L at 4 \nMarch 16, 2009 \n$265 \nVehicle Debt-\u00b6 1.g \nAE L at 3 \nMarch 10, 2009 \n$132 \nUtility Debt-\u00b6 1.l  \nAE L at 2 \nMarch 5, 2009 \n$187 \n\u00b6 1.b \nAE L at 1 \nMarch 3, 2009 \n$148 \n\u00b6 1.b \nAE L at 1 \nMarch 2, 2009 \n$240 \n\u00b6 1.f \nAE L at 1 \nFebruary 20, 2009 \n$240 \n\u00b6 1.f \nAE M at 3 \nFebruary 17, 2009 \n$240 \n\u00b6 1.f \nAE M at 2 \nFebruary 4, 2009 \n$148 \n\u00b6 1.b \nAE M at 1 \nJanuary 20, 2009 \n$265 \nVehicle Debt-\u00b6 1.g \nAE N at 2 \nJanuary 6, 2009 \n$278 \nUtility Debt-\u00b6 1.l  \nAE N at 1 \nTOTAL \n$3,657 \n \n \n \nApplicant explained his delinquent debts resulted from \u201cmismanagement of [his] \nfinances and through various mishaps\u201d (Tr. 104). The cost to repair his car was about \n$2,000 (Tr. 104-105). In June 2008, his apartment was vandalized, and his personal \nproperty, valued at around $700, was stolen (Tr. 104-105). Shortly after he purchased \nhis 2003 Ford, it was vandalized (Tr. 107). \n \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s February 9, 2008, credit report showed a $32,375 student loan debt in deferred \nstatus (GE 5 at 7). The creditor threatened to garnish his pay unless he resumed monthly payments of \n$597 starting July 1, 2009 (Tr. 92-93). He made a $597 payment on July 1, 2009 (AE I at 3). \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s brother was murdered (Tr. 109). He provided some support \nfor his deceased brother\u2019s daughter, who is five years old (Tr. 109). For example, he \nmight buy her some clothing or food if he was babysitting (Tr. 110). He wanted to create \nan educational fund for his niece (Tr. 109, 111). Applicant has not sought financial \ncounseling (Tr. 108). In February 2009, Applicant\u2019s employer selected him as employee \nof the month (Tr. 117). He contributed $28 to a charity on July 11, 2009 (AE I at 1), May \n12, 2009 (AE J at 4), April 11, 2009 (AE K at 1), March 11, 2009 (AE L at 2), February \n11, 2009 (AE M at 1), and January 13, 2009 (AE N at 2). \n \nAlleged falsification of security clearance applications (SF-86s) \n \nOn January 25, 2008, and on July 30, 2008, Applicant signed his SF-86s (Tr. 69; \nGE 1, GE 2). In regard to his delinquent debts and repossessed vehicles, his SF-86 \nasked three questions. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to questions 27b, 28a and 28b (GE 1; \nGE 2), which asked: \n \nSection 27: Your Financial Record \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \nb. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any \nproperty repossessed for any reason? \n \nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)? \n \nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \n \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 contains the following admonition: \n \nCertification That My Answers Are True \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \n \n(emphasis in original) (GE 1; GE 2). Immediately below this admonition appears his \nsignature (GE 1; GE 2). Applicant admitted that he signed and certified these two SF-\n86s (Tr. 69, 72).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant said he thought his vehicle repossession occurred in August 2008, \nwhich is after the dates he completed his two SF-86s (Tr. 75).3 When he completed his \nfirst SF-86, he had missed some payments; however, he did not believe that his debts \nwere delinquent at least 90-days (Tr. 74). When he completed his second SF-86, he \nagreed he had debts that were delinquent over 90 days and explained that he failed to \ndisclose the required information because of an oversight (Tr. 71, 77). He was pressed \nat work to complete a database and did not thoroughly review his answers on his SF-86 \n(Tr. 71, 77). He understood that security clearance investigators obtain a credit report \n(Tr. 78). He repeatedly denied that he intentionally provided false information on his SF-\n86s (Tr. 123; GE 8).     \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s August 7, 2008, credit report shows his vehicle payment to be 60 days late, and \ndoes not show any vehicle repossession(s) (Tr. 76; GE 4 at 4). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that \nare of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his \nSOR response and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwere paid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Five substantial SOR debts, totaling \nabout $31,800 are currently delinquent. He does not have a credible plan to address \nthese five SOR debts. The deferment on his $32,000 student loan ended, and on July 1, \n2009, he made one $597 payment under threat of garnishment. His delinquent debts \noccurred under such circumstances that they are likely to recur and continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of his unemployment and underemployment. He does not \nreceive full mitigating credit because he has been continuously employed at a salary of \n$58,900 since April 2008. In 2009, he had an unexpected car repair expense of about \n$2,000. In June 2008, his apartment was vandalized, and his personal property, valued \nat about $700, was stolen. Shortly after he purchased the 2003 Ford, it was vandalized. \nThese relatively minor unexpected expenses are insufficient to cause such large \ndelinquent debts, and he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ncircumstances. Applicant did not receive credit counseling and he did not provide \npayment plans showing how he was resolving five SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply.  \n \nApplicant has established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because \nhe showed some, recent good faith4 in the resolution of his SOR debts. He made some \npayments on several large SOR debts and resolved seven debts. I have credited \nApplicant with payment of the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($157), 1.h ($142), 1.i \n($274), and 1.j ($153) even though he only provided proof of two $116 payments. He \ncredibly stated the creditor for these medical accounts told him that his medical debts \nwere resolved. He also established payment of the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($1,213), 1.f \n($1,045), and 1.l ($425). Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity \nof any debts and AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. He did not establish that he maintained contact \nwith his creditors, or that he made or attempted to make partial payments to several of \nthem.5 He said he would provide proof of SOR debt payments over the previous six \nmonths after his hearing. He showed payments totaling $3,657. However, over the \nApril-June 2009 period, he only showed payments of $1,158 (includes $597 payment on \nhis student loan, which is not an SOR debt). At his hearing, he incorrectly stated he had \npayment plans in place and was making payments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g), and his \n$5,603 debt could be settled for about $500 and was paid (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He was honest \nand credible about his good intentions, but confused and disorganized. I am convinced \nfinancial problems will continue.       \n \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n5\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security \nclearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nOn January 25, 2008, and on July 30, 2008, Applicant signed SF-86s. In \nquestion 27b, his SF-86s asked about whether he had any repossessed property. \nApplicant correctly replied \u201cNo\u201d because his vehicle was repossessed after July 30, \n2008.  \n \nHis SF-86 asked a question about debts 180-days delinquent in the last seven \nyears and a question about debts currently 90-days delinquent. Applicant correctly \nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to these two questions on his January 25, 2008 SF-86 because his \ndebts were not delinquent for at least 180 days or 90 days, respectively. However, he \nincorrectly answered \u201cNo\u201d on his July 30, 2008 SF-86 because he did have debts that \nwere 90-days delinquent by July 30, 2008. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply and further \nreview is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nApplicant credibly stated he carelessly rushed through his July 30, 2008 SF-86 \nand failed to disclose his debts that were currently at least 90-days delinquent. He was \nworking hard trying to meet deadlines for his employer, and did not show the careful, \nconscientious attention to detail necessary to properly complete his SF-86. I conclude \nApplicant\u2019s alleged falsification of his SF-86 is mitigated. Although he provided false \ninformation on his SF-86, AG \u00b6 17(f) applies. The falsification allegations are not \nsubstantiated. I am satisfied he did not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose his \ndelinquent debts with intent to deceive.6 I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Findings section of \nthis decision with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.   \n \n \n \n6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is summarized in this \nparagraph; however, it is insufficient to fully mitigate security concerns. There is no \nevidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His security clearance \napplication did not disclose any problems with alcohol or drug abuse. His financial \nproblems were initially caused by unemployment and underemployment, which are \nfactors somewhat beyond his control. He paid seven SOR debts. He paid his non-SOR \ndebts. He has not received any new credit cards. Applicant has achieved some \nimportant educational and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, \nresponsibility and dedication. He obtained employment with his current employer in April \n2008, and has been able to maintain and continue that employment. He understands \nwhat he needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated \nhis loyalty, patriotism, and trustworthiness through his service to the Department of \nDefense as a contractor. He supports his niece and contributes to charity.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct is more substantial. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent after his current employer hired him in \nApril 2008, and his pay was increased to $58,900. At his hearing, he incorrectly stated \nhe had payment plans in place and was making payments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g). He \nalso mistakenly indicated his $5,603 debt could be settled for about $500 and was paid \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c). He was incorrect about these payment plans and payments. Applicant \ndoes not have established payment plans to address the five SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($7,312), 1.c ($5,603), 1.d ($635), 1.g ($18,065), and 1.k ($188), totaling about $31,800. \nHis student loan debt of approximately $32,000 was in deferment status until July 1, \n2009, and now he must continue to make monthly payments of $597 or his pay will be \ngarnished.   \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nHe should have made greater and more systematic progress on the five \nunresolved SOR debts. He should have acted more aggressively to pay his delinquent \ndebts or to arrange and establish payment plans, and to better document his remedial \nefforts. These factors show some financial irresponsibility. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated personal conduct concerns; \nhowever, he has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c and 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h to 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 14, 2007. On \nFebruary 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on February 25, 2009; answered it on April 21, 2009; \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nAugust 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApril 22, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 17, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on June 29, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June \n30, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 28, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through V, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until August 14, 2009, to enable \nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on August 5, 2009. On August 10, 2009, Applicant submitted AX W. The record \nclosed on August 14, 2009.  \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s middle name was inadvertently omitted from the SOR. On my own \nmotion and without objection, the SOR was amended to insert his middle name (Tr. 19). \nThe amendment is handwritten on the SOR.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old security guard employed part-time by a federal \ncontractor. He also works as a security clerk for another employer (Tr. 57-58). He \nexpects to work full-time as a security guard when the status of his security clearance is \nresolved (Tr. 57). He has worked in his security guard position since May 2009. He \nrecently applied for an additional part-time position as an access control officer or \nsecurity escort (AX U). He has completed numerous courses, many of them online, to \nimprove his professional qualifications (AX M through T). \n \n \nApplicant attended college from the fall of 1995 until the spring of 1997. He \ndeployed to Bosnia as a member of the Army National Guard in August 1997. He \nreturned to school in the fall of 1998 and remained until the fall of 2000, but he did not \ngraduate (Tr. 70-71).  \n \n \nApplicant worked as a store manager from January 2000 to November 2001, and \nwas unemployed from November 2001 to January 2002. He worked as a loss \nprevention agent at a record and video store from January to August 2002 and as a \nfinancial specialist at a loan company from August 2002 to August 2003. He worked as \na security specialist from August 2003 to June 2004. He worked as an executive \nchauffeur for a federal contractor from June 2004 to September 2006, and as a \nconsultant for a federal contractor from September 2006 until he began his current \nemployment in May 2009. He held a security clearance during his two previous jobs \nwith federal contractors.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in October 2005, while he and his wife were students. \nThey have never lived together. They have a seven-year-old son, born before they were \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmarried. Applicant pays child support, which is automatically deducted from his pay (Tr. \n69). He has obtained an apartment and hopes to have his wife and son join him in the \nnear future (Tr. 52-53). His son suffers from a high-functioning level of autism (Tr. 65). \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties since mid-2002. Between July \n2002 and December 2004, Applicant\u2019s landlord obtained three judgments against him \nfor unpaid rent (GX 2 at 3). All three judgments were paid (Tr. 75-76). He was evicted \nfor nonpayment of rent in February 2004 and January 2007 (Tr. 79-80).  \n \n \nThere have been no payments on Applicant\u2019s student loan, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nsince December 2002 (Tr. 94). He testified he was unable to negotiate a payment plan \nfor the student loan, because the collection agencies insisted on payment in full. The \nloan is being transferred to the Department of Education, and he hopes to negotiate a \npayment plan after the loan is transferred (Tr. 50; AX W).  \n \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant enrolled in a debt consolidation program (AX A; AX D; Tr. \n82). The program provides for monthly payments of about $188 for 40 months (AX D at \n10; Tr. 104). The first four payments cover the program fee, and after the fee is paid, \npayments will be disbursed to creditors (AX D at 7; Tr. 105). Applicant made the first \npayment in May, and no funds have yet been disbursed to creditors. The medical bill \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and the deficiency from the auto repossession alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h are included in the debt consolidation program.  \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nCollection \n(DLA1 Mar. 07)  \n$59 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 1 \n1.b \nTuition  \n(DLA Jul. 06) \n$134 \nPaid by offset from state \ntax refund  \nAX V; Tr. 108 \n1.c \nMedical \n(DLA Nov. 03) \n$703 \nDebt consolidation \nprogram  \nAX D at 5;  \nTr. 89-90 \n1.d \nTelephone \n(DLA Jan. 04) \n$538 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 1; \nAX W; Tr. 93 \n1.e \nCable Service \n(DLA Feb. 07) \n$1,286 \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 1 \n1.f \nStudent Loan \n(DLA Dec. 02) \n$19,221 \nUnpaid; hopes to negotiate \npayment plan \nGX 2 at 5;  \nAX W; Tr. 50 \n1.g \nTelephone Bill \n \n$265 \nPaid, Mar. 09 \nAX B at 5;  \nTr. 81 \n1.h \nAuto repossession \nIn Aug. 06 \n$11,702 \nDebt consolidation \nprogram \nAX D at 5;  \nTr. 82, 94 \n \n                                                          \n1 DLA is the date of last activity. The date is reflected by month and year. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $33,908. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises these three disqualifying conditions, shifting the \nburden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not applicable because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are ongoing, \nnumerous, and not the product of unusual circumstances. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant has experienced \nseveral conditions beyond his control. He was unemployed from November 2001 to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nJanuary 2002. He is incurring the expenses of maintaining two households because he \nand his family are geographically separated. His son has special medical needs. On the \nother hand, he has been employed continuously since January 2002, but he has not \nadjusted his spending to his income. He does not have a good grasp of his financial \nsituation and is dependent on others, such as the managers of his debt consolidation \nprogram, to manage his money for him. He did not act responsibly until April 2009, after \nhe received the SOR, when he finally sought professional help. This mitigating condition \nis not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Although \nApplicant has enrolled in a debt consolidation program, there is no evidence he has \nsought or obtained financial counseling. Four debts, including the student loan, his \nlargest debt, are not included in his debt consolidation program, and they remain \nunresolved. This mitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts because of the pressure of qualifying for a security \nclearance.   \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. \n \n \nThe tuition debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was paid by withholding Applicant\u2019s tax \nreturns, not by voluntary action on his part. His involuntary payment of the debt resolves \nthe security concern arising from it, but it does not establish the good-faith effort \ncontemplated by AG \u00b6 20(d). He receives credit for paying the delinquent telephone bill \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He has included the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h in his debt \nconsolidation program, but as of the date of the hearing no funds had been disbursed in \npayment of those debts. His actions to resolve his delinquent debts were prompted by \nhis receipt of the SOR rather than a sense of duty or obligation. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nnot established. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has held a security clearance for several years, \napparently without incident. He has worked for federal contractors for about five years. \nAlthough he has been employed steadily since January 2002, he has a long record of \nfinancial difficulty.2 His recent enrollment in a debt consolidation program may be a step \nin the right direction, but insufficient time has passed to determine if he will adhere to his \nplan and establish a track record of financial responsibility. He has yet to resolve his \nstudent loan and several other smaller debts. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n                                                          \n2 The three judgments for unpaid rent and the two evictions for nonpayment of rent were not alleged in \nthe SOR. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to decide whether a particular adjudicative \nguideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole person \nanalysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the uncharged \nmisconduct for those limited purposes.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He is making payments to address one SOR debt through garnishment of his \npay. He has not made any payments to any of his other SOR creditors. He intentionally \nfalsified his 2007 security clearance application. Financial considerations and personal \nconduct concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 20, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On May 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 8) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nOctober 5, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleged \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 10 and 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On August \n20, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On August 21, 2009, DOHA issued a \nhearing notice (GE 7). On August 27, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held.1 At the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 20-21), and \nApplicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 82-83; AE A-B). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 20-21), and AE A-B (Tr. 83). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of \nHearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 7-9). On September 3, 2009, I received \nthe transcript.    \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, Applicant admitted he owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.r (GE 9). He admitted he lied when he completed his December 20, 2007, SF-\n86 (GE 9). He explained that he compromised his integrity because he needed to earn a \nliving and pay his financial obligations (GE 9). He said he was slowly eliminating his \noverdue financial obligations and would continue to make them his priority (GE 9). His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 63 years old, and he is seeking employment with a defense \ncontractor (Tr. 6). He entered the United States from a South American country in 1969 \n(Tr. 41). He joined the U.S. Army and served in Korea as a medic (Tr. 41). From 1971 to \n1974, he was on active duty (Tr. 41-42, 46). He received an honorable discharge from \nthe Army (GE 1). In 1973, he became a U.S. citizen (Tr. 46). He completed one year of \ncollege (Tr. 6). From 1974 to 1996, he worked for the subway as a laborer and foreman \n(Tr. 42, 47). He recently held an interim Secret security clearance (Tr. 7).   \n \nFrom 1996 to 2003, Applicant lived in a South American country (Tr. 42, 48). \nThere were riots and rampant crime in the South American country, and Applicant \ndecided to return to the United States (Tr. 42, 72-73). From June 2003 to April 2004, he \nreturned to working on the subway (Tr. 49). From April 2004 to the present, he worked \nfor a series of government contractors (Tr. 50, 75). On May 25, 2009, he lost his \n \n1At his hearing, Applicant waived his right to 15-days\u2019 notice of the date, time, and location of his \nhearing (Tr. 15-16). \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nemployment because of his security clearance problem (Tr. 74-75).  For the last two \nyears before he became unemployed, he earned about $30,000 to $32,000 per year \n(Tr. 75).   \n \nIn 2004, Applicant married a woman living in the South American country where \nhe was born (Tr. 50). He was anxious to get his wife out of the South American country \nbecause of the criminal activity where she lived and the exceptional danger to her \nperson (Tr. 45). In 2006, he was able to bring his spouse to the United States (Tr. 50). \nApplicant has three children and three stepchildren (Tr. 51). His children do not live with \nhim; however, one of his stepchildren lives in his household (Tr. 51). His sick brother \nalso stays with Applicant (Tr. 57, 59). Two of his stepchildren are still living in the South \nAmerican country (Tr. 51). In total, Applicant provides support in his household for his \nspouse, one stepchild, and his sick brother.   \n \nA court order required Applicant to pay for child support; however, he insisted he \nwas not the child\u2019s father (Tr. 52; SOR response).  He asked the judge to order a DNA \ntest to establish paternity; however, he did not have the funds to pay for the DNA test \nbecause he was unemployed at that time (Tr. 52). Now that he has sufficient funds for \nthe DNA test, he is unable to locate the child (Tr. 71). From February 2007 to February \n2008, the court garnished $100 a month from Applicant\u2019s pay (Tr. 56). The judge \ndeclined to order the DNA test (Tr. 52). He currently owes about $10,000 in child \nsupport arrearage, and he pays $35 a month (Tr. 53, 55). \n   \nFinancial considerations \n \nThe SOR listed 18 delinquent debts, totaling $47,979 as follows: 1.a ($161); 1.b \n($12,130); 1.c ($12,643); 1.d ($860); 1.e ($611); 1.f ($1,122); 1.g ($463); 1.h ($688); 1.i \n($1,325); 1.j ($738); 1.k ($12,924); 1.l ($705); 1.m ($860); 1.n ($946); 1.o ($518); 1.p \n($266); 1.q ($620); and 1.r ($399). \n \nIn June of 2006, Applicant went to the South American country where he was \nborn to bring his spouse to the United States (Tr. 63, 65). In July 2006, she moved to \nthe United States (Tr. 66, 81). The trip cost about $5,000 (Tr. 80). Applicant\u2019s spouse \nmoved into his apartment, and he needed a larger apartment (Tr. 61).  His monthly rent \nwent from about $750 to about $1,200 (Tr. 62). His utilities also increased (Tr. 62). She \nwas underemployed until recently when she received a permanent green card (Tr. 64).  \n \nIn December 2006, the payroll checks from Applicant\u2019s employer had a problem \nand Applicant\u2019s bank account was overdrawn (Tr. 66). His checks bounced and he had \nto pay about ten returned-check fees (Tr. 66). A month later his check from his \nemployer arrived; however, his employer did not reimburse him for his returned-check \nfees (Tr. 67). The total cost for the returned checks was $350 (Tr. 80).  \n \nOn February 25, 2008, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant (GE 2). The OPM interview thoroughly discussed Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts (GE 2). He promised to pay several of his SOR debts by December \n2008 (GE 2). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nOn April 5, 2009, he made one $260 payment to a debt consolidation company \n(Tr. 76; GE 2). He learned he could settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b for about $5,000 and \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p for $56 (Tr. 77). He did not make any payments to any SOR \ncreditors, except for the monthly $35 payments on his child support arrearage (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k). He did not receive financial counseling (Tr. 77). \n \nFalsification of security clearance application (SF-86) \n \nOn December 20, 2007, Applicant completed his SF-86 (Tr. 68; GE 1). The SOR \nalleges that in regard to his relevant financial history, his SF-86 asked two questions. \nApplicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to subsections 27b and 27d (GE 1). Subsections 27b and 27d \nasked: \n \nSection 27: Your Financial Record \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \nb. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any \nproperty repossessed for any reason? \n \nd. In the last seven years, have you had any judgments against you that \nhave not been paid? \n \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 contains the following admonition: \n \nCertification That My Answers Are True \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \n \n(emphasis in original) (GE 1). Immediately below this admonition appears his signature \n(Tr. 68; GE 1). Applicant admitted that he signed and certified this SF-86 (Tr. 68).  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his SF-86, when he failed to disclose the \njudgment for overdue child support and the follow-on garnishment of his pay for the \nchild support arrearage (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b; GE 1, 6).3 On February 25, 2008, \nApplicant admitted to an OPM investigator that he had $12,924 in delinquent child \nsupport and that his pay was being garnished as recently as October 2007 (GE 2). At \n \n3 A 1995 judgment for child support in the amount of $5,289 was included in the record (GE 6). It \nis unclear when the court ordered subsequent judgments. It is clear that Applicant\u2019s pay was being \ngarnished at the time he filled out his 2007 SF-86 for a child-support collection that totaled at that time for \nabout $12,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). In the findings, I will merge the judgment falsification allegation into the \ngarnishment allegation and find For Applicant in SOR \u00b6 2.b. See page 12, infra.  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhis hearing, Applicant admitted $100 per month of his pay was being garnished for the \nchild support arrearage when he signed his SF-86 (Tr. 68). He explained that he did not \nanswer his SF-86 truthfully because he thought he might not be hired if he was behind \non paying child support (Tr. 69).  \n \nCharacter evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor was in charge of the department\u2019s investigatory file \nsystem and a retired federal criminal investigator (Tr. 23-24, 31). He has known \nApplicant since December 2008, and he has daily contact with Applicant throughout the \nduty day (Tr. 25-26, 29). The investigatory files contain information at Secret and \nsensitive classification or protection levels (Tr. 26). Applicant was initially a temporary \nworker and later became permanently assigned by specific request because of his solid \nwork performance (Tr. 25). Applicant is a very hard working, trustworthy, and reliable \nemployee (Tr. 27, 32). He has a positive attitude, shows initiative, and is willing to arrive \nearly and work late to complete tasks (Tr. 27-28). He is conscientious about security \nand safeguards sensitive information (Tr. 28). \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from April 2006 to April 2007 said Applicant was a laborer \nwho set up conference rooms for meetings, moved furniture, and made repairs (Tr. 35-\n36). She supervised his work on a daily basis (Tr. 37). She described him as very \ndependable, trustworthy, hard working, and responsible (Tr. 37-39). Applicant was often \nrequested to take care of tasks because of his work ethic and positive attitude (Tr. 38).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is \nalso documented in his OPM interview, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR \nresponse, and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were \npaid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He has made insufficient progress paying \nor resolving 17 of his 18 SOR debts, which now total about $45,000. None of the SOR \ndebts are paid or disputed. His delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted from underemployment, a dispute over child support, his employer\u2019s \nlate payment of one month\u2019s pay, the necessity for Applicant to travel to South America \nto assist his spouse in moving to the United States, his costs to resettle her in the \nUnited States, and the expenses of moving into and maintaining a larger residence in \nthe United States.4 He does not receive full mitigating credit because he did not \nestablish that he acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to address his delinquent \ndebts. He did not provide sufficient documentation about his income and expenditures \nover the last two years to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n   \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. \nAlthough he provided a personal financial statement and started a debt consolidation \nand repayment plan, he did not demonstrate a sufficiently firm grasp of budgeting, \npayment plans, and expense reduction. He did not show any reduction in his expenses \neven though he learned about the security significance of his delinquent debts during \nhis OPM interview on February 25, 2008. He has not demonstrated the financial self-\ndiscipline necessary to reduce and resolve his debts. There are not \u201cclear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He does not receive full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he did not establish good faith5 in the resolution of \nhis SOR debts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because of the lack of documentation supporting \nApplicant\u2019s dispute of any debts. However, under all the circumstances, I did mitigate \nhis child support debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k) because he is making payments and attempted to \ndispute this debt by requesting a DNA test.   \n \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner \nto \nresolve \nhis \ndelinquent \ndebts. \nHis \ndebts \ninitially \nresulted \nfrom \nunderemployment, a dispute over child support, his employer\u2019s late payment of one \nmonth\u2019s pay, the necessity for Applicant to travel to South America to assist his spouse \nin moving to the United States, and the costs to set up a family household in the United \nStates. His SOR listed 18 debts and about $45,000 is owed to his creditors. I am not \nconfident he will keep his promise to pay his delinquent debts because of his insufficient \ntrack record of financial progress shown over the last two years.     \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security \nclearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nOn December 20, 2007, Applicant completed his SF-86, which asked, \u201c[i]n the \nlast 7 years, have you had your wages garnished .  .  .  for any reason?\u201d Applicant \nfalsely responded \u201cNo\u201d to this question. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply because he \nprovided a false answer about his pay being garnished. Further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nApplicant credibly stated he intentionally falsified his SF-86 with the intent to \ndeceive the government about the garnishment of his pay for child support.6 Applicant \nthought he would not be hired if he accurately disclosed this information. He receives \npartial credit for admitting on February 25, 2008, to an OPM investigator that he had \n$12,924 in delinquent child support, and his pay was being garnished as recently as \nOctober 2007. He also admitted in his SOR response and at his hearing that he \n \n6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \u201cWhen an applicant claims that a false answer to a [SF-86] question is not deliberate, the Judge \nshould address explicitly any contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-07998 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 12, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 07-03307 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2008)). \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndeliberately provided false information on his SF-86 to deceive the government about \nhis financial situation. He was candid and forthright at his hearing about his financial \nproblems. I conclude, however, that his honesty to the OPM investigator and thereafter \nabout falsifying his SF-86 is not sufficient to mitigate the falsification of his SF-86 itself.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \nThe whole person factors supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they are insufficient to warrant approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance at this time. Applicant\u2019s supervisors noted Applicant\u2019s excellent work \nperformance. He is a diligent, hard working, and dedicated employee. He was candid \nand forthright about falsifying his SF-86 to obtain employment. I do not believe he would \nfalsify a future SF-86. His financial problems initially resulted because of \nunderemployment, a dispute over child support, his employer\u2019s late payment of one \nmonth\u2019s pay, the necessity for Applicant to travel to South America to assist his spouse \nin moving to the United States, and costs to resettle her in the United States. Now that \nthe government is well-aware of his financial problems and falsification of his SF-86, his \nmotive to conceal these particular acts of misconduct and vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress have been eliminated. Applicant is a capable, reliable, and \ndedicated employee.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant submitted a false SF-86 in December 2007. He has 17 delinquent SOR debts \ntotaling about $45,000. He did not take action to use a debt consolidation plan until \nMarch of 2009, and he made his first and only $260 payment into the plan in April of \n2009. The only payment actually made to his creditors resulted from garnishment of his \npay for a child support arrearage. His efforts to address his delinquent debts for the last \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ntwo years have been inadequate, and financial considerations concerns are not \nmitigated at this time. His misconduct concerning falsification of his SF-86 cannot be \nmitigated because the falsification was knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He \nwas sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Falsification of a security \nclearance application shows a lack of trustworthiness and poor judgment. Such conduct \ngoes to the heart of the clearance process, and a security clearance is not warranted at \nthis time.     \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors,\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l to 1.r:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

On July 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n2\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 14, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 23, 2009, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On August 11, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for September 2,\n2009.\nAt the hearing, four government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and two Applicant exhibits (Ex.\nA-B) were admitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant testified, as reflected\nin a transcript (Tr.) received on September 10, 2009. I also agreed to take\nadministrative notice of certain facts pertinent to Israel and to Russia and their\nrespective foreign relations, including with the U.S., infra.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn July 23, 2009, in two separate motions, Department Counsel requested\nadministrative notice be taken of certain facts relating to Israel and to the Russian\nFederation, and their respective foreign relations, including with the U.S. The\ngovernment\u2019s requests were based on publications from the U.S. State Department, the\nCongressional Research Service, the National Counterintelligence Center, the Office of\nthe National Counterintelligence Executive, the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, and\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. The government\u2019s\nformal requests and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were\nincluded in the record. Applicant was given an opportunity to respond at his hearing,\nand he did not object to my taking administrative notice. Those facts accepted for\nadministrative notice are set forth in the Findings of Fact, infra.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s son is a\nresident citizen of Russia (SOR 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a dual citizen of\nthe U.S. and Israel who resides in the U.S. but receives a survivor\u2019s military pension\nfrom the Israeli government (SOR 1.b); that Applicant served in the Israeli military from\nabout June 1980 until about July 1988 (SOR 1.c); that during August 1984 to August\n1988, he worked as a research scientist at a nuclear institute affiliated with an Israeli\ngovernment organization and he held an Israeli security clearance (SOR 1.d); and that\n\n3\nfrom 1996 until at least 2005, while living and working in the U.S., Applicant was\nregularly contacted by Israeli government officials or agents concerning his past work\nfor the Israeli nuclear research institute (SOR 1.e). Applicant admitted that his son is a\nRussian resident citizen, and that his mother-in-law receives an Israeli pension from her\ndeceased spouse\u2019s former, nonmilitary employment with the Israeli government.\nApplicant acknowledged his past employment with the Israeli nuclear research institute,\nalthough he denied that he had held an Israeli security clearance for that position. He\nadmitted that he had been contacted by Israeli officials in the U.S. about his previous\nwork with the Israeli nuclear research institute and whether anyone had tried to extract\nsecret information from him. He added that on learning from the U.S. Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) that these foreign contacts were \u201cout of line,\u201d he cooperated with the\nFBI, and alerted the FBI of a subsequent final contact from an Israeli official.\nAfter considering the pleadings, transcript, and documentary exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant was born in Russia (then the Soviet Union) in 1950. He married his first\nwife in Russia in June 1974, and they had a son in August 1975. Three years later,\nApplicant and his first wife divorced (Ex. 1).\nIn 1979, Applicant immigrated to Israel and became an Israeli citizen. Applicant\nwas allowed to leave Russia despite a major invention and publication that made his\nname known there and in the U.S. scientific community (Tr. 83). His Soviet citizenship\nwas revoked (Ex. 2). In July 1981, he and his current spouse were married in Israel. A\nRussian \u00e9migr\u00e9, she had acquired her Israeli citizenship in 1978. While living in Israel,\nApplicant and his spouse had two daughters, who were born in 1982 and 1984 (Ex. 1).\nApplicant served in the Israeli military as a machine gunner (Tr. 36) from about\nJuly 1980 to July 1988, at least some of that time on active reserve duty (Exs. 1, 2, 3).\nFrom August 1984 to August 1988, he was employed as a scientist at an applied\nnuclear research and development institute affiliated with an Israeli governmental\norganization (Ex. 4). During his final year at the Israeli research institute, he pursued his\ndoctorate degree at an Israeli university. He was awarded his doctorate degree in June\n1988 (Ex. 1).\nApplicant first came to the U.S. from Israel in 1988 when he was on sabbatical.\nHe decided to remain in the U.S. because of better opportunities for his children and the\nsafer environment, and he obtained a work visa (Tr. 84). He was eventually granted\nU.S. permanent residency. His immediate family (spouse and daughters) immigrated to\nthe U.S. from Israel, and his mother and brother from Russia. In February 1992, a son\nwas born to Applicant and his spouse in the U.S. (Ex. 1). Applicant and his spouse\nbecame dual citizens of the U.S. and Israel when they acquired naturalized U.S.\n\nAt his hearing, Applicant denied he was still a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S., but he admitted that\n1\nthe Israeli government still considers him a citizen because he had not applied to renounce his Israeli\ncitizenship (Tr. 70-71).\nAs of November 2006, Applicant\u2019s father had died. Applicant indicated on his e-QIP that his father\n2\nhad held Russian citizenship (Ex. 1), and that his mother was a citizen of the U.S. only. She apparently\nremained behind in Russia with her other son after Applicant immigrated to Israel (Tr. 36).\nApplicant testified it was \u201clike if somebody was trying to bribe [him]\u201d (Tr. 70).\n3\nApplicant was apparently told by Israeli officials that he was being contacted because he had been\n4\nemployed in a defense-related field in Israel, and Israel wanted to ensure that he had not been approached\nby any foreign agents for information. He denied any further contact of this nature after the FBI  \u201capparently\nmade Israel close the program\u201d (Tr. 79).\n4\ncitizenship in October 1998.  Their two daughters became dual citizens of Israel and the\n1\nU.S. in July 1999. Applicant\u2019s mother became a U.S. naturalized citizen in January\n1996, and his brother in April 2000 (Ex. 1).2\nApplicant had his own company in the U.S. from December 1995 to May 1997.\nThereafter, he worked for a succession of employers located in various regions of the\nU.S., including for a defense contractor from April 2002 to October 2003 (Ex. 1).\nStarting in about 1996, Applicant was contacted by Israeli officials or agents in the U.S.,\nabout once a year on average, by telephone or at times in person. Applicant was asked\nwhether he had ever been approached for sensitive (\u201csecret\u201d) information concerning\nhis work at the nuclear research institute in Israel (Exs. 1, 3, Tr. 37, 48, 67).   The\n3\nIsraelis did not share with him how they knew where and when to reach him. Applicant\nwas required to notify the Israeli embassy of his whereabouts when he came to the\nU.S., but he did not register subsequent changes of address in the U.S. with the Israeli\nembassy or consulate (Tr. 74-75). Applicant testified that when he relocated to a distant\nlocale for employment in about 1997, he \u201cmight have told\u201d the Israeli officials or agents\nwho contacted him of his intended destination. When Applicant moved across the\ncountry for a new job in 2001, he \u201cmight have told them ahead of time\u201d that he was\nleaving \u201cbecause they asked [him] a question about what his plans were. . . .\u201d (Tr. 74).\nIn about 2004, the FBI approached Applicant about his contacts with these Israeli\nofficials or agents. He provided details of the previous contacts, and when the Israeli\nofficials or agents subsequently contacted him in about June 2005, he notified the FBI\nof the contact (Ex. 3, Tr. 38).  Applicant never informed any of his U.S. employers of\n4\nthese foreign contacts (Tr. 47). According to Applicant, he did not consider the actions\nof the Israeli officials or agents to be significant (Tr. 48, 80).\nIn November 2006, Applicant began working as a precision sensor electronics\nsenior engineer for his present employer, a laboratory engaged in U.S. defense work\n(Exs. 1, A). On December 11, 2006, Applicant\u2019s expired Israeli passport, which was\nvalid from October 1996 to October 2001, was shredded in his employer\u2019s security\noffice to facilitate him obtaining a DoD security clearance (Ex. 2). On his e-QIP\ncompleted on December 11, 2006, Applicant indicated that he, his spouse, and their two\ndaughters held dual citizenship with Israel and the U..S., although his younger son held\n\n5\nonly U.S. citizenship. Applicant also indicated that his mother and brother were\nnaturalized U.S. resident citizens. Applicant disclosed that his oldest son, a Russian\ncitizen, was living with him in the U.S. His father-in-law, an Israeli citizen, and his\nmother-in-law, a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S. since her U.S. naturalization in April\n2005, were living with him and his spouse in the U.S. as well. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d\nto question 17.b on the e-QIP concerning whether he had ever been employed by a\nforeign government, firm, or agency. Yet, in response to question 17.c concerning any\ncontacts with a foreign government, its establishments, or representatives, Applicant\ndisclosed that he had been contacted by the Israeli government from about March 1989\nto June 2005 \u201conce in [a] great while in connection with [his] security clearance back in\nIsrael, asking routine questions as to whether any secret information [he] could have\nknown while in Israel could have been compromised, or whether anybody tried to\napproach [him] regarding that information.\u201d Applicant indicated that he had not been\nexposed to any secret information so the process was \u201cpure formality.\u201d (Ex. 1)\nApplicant now denies that he had held a security clearance during his employment with\nthe Israeli nuclear research institute because he had not been told that he held one, he\nhad not accessed classified information, and it would have been difficult to obtain a\nclearance given that his mother and brother lived in Russia at the time (Tr. 36). \nOn March 5, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for\nthe Department of Defense concerning his allegiance, which he asserted was solely to\nthe U.S., and his foreign contacts. Applicant denied any contact from anyone\nrepresenting a foreign intelligence or security service. Yet, he acknowledged that after\nhe had immigrated to the U.S., Israeli government officials contacted him by phone or in\nperson until 2005 to verify that no one had requested information about his position as a\nscientist in Israel, but that the FBI found out and he was told to have no contact with\nthese foreign nationals in the future. Applicant volunteered that his father-in-law had\ndied, and that his mother-in-law was receiving a widow\u2019s pension that was being\ndeposited into an account in Israel, which had a balance of about $10,000 to $20,000.\nApplicant denied that he or his family owned any property in a foreign country.\nConcerning his son from his first marriage, Applicant indicated that his son had returned\nto his native Russia two years ago. Applicant indicated that his son ran a publishing\ncompany in Russia and was a local television personality (Ex. 3).\nOn February 19, 2009, Applicant responded to foreign influence interrogatories\nfrom DOHA which included the query, \u201cSince you became a naturalized U.S. citizen in\nOctober 1999, have you ever been contacted by a foreign government, foreign\nbusiness, foreign organization, foreign group, or foreign person, who asked you for\ninformation or help in any matter?\u201d Applicant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d (Ex. 2). Concerning\nongoing contacts with foreign citizens, Applicant admitted occasional email contacts\nwith his son in Russia to as recently as February 8, 2009. He indicated he was also in\ncontact with three former classmates with Russian or Israeli citizenship, but he claimed\nto not know their occupations (Ex. 2).\nOn March 10, 2009, Applicant was forwarded subsequent interrogatories by\nDOHA in which he was asked specifically about his contacts with Israeli government\n\n6\nofficials. Applicant indicated that his first contact was in about 1996. He was called at\nhome two or three times, and then met by an Israeli in person. Subsequent contacts\nwere on the order of about once a year, not always with the same person. He admitted\nhe had not reported the contacts until after the FBI inquiry because the contacts\n\u201cseemed totally innocent to [him].\u201d Applicant averred that the FBI was completely\nsatisfied with his voluntary cooperation (Ex. 3).\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law immigrated to the U.S. from Israel in about September\n1999. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law (and Applicant\u2019s father-in-law before his death) lived\nwith Applicant and his spouse since coming to the U.S. (Tr. 52). On the death of her\nspouse, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law received a pension from her husband\u2019s former\nemployment with a nonmilitary department in the Israeli government (Answer, Ex. 3, Tr.\n34-35). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law maintains a bank account in Israel into which the\npension funds are deposited and then transferred to the U.S. (Tr. 50-51). She also owns\nan apartment in Israel (Tr. 51).\nAfter almost 20 years of no contact, Applicant contacted his first wife in Russia\nthree or four times in the late 1990s concerning paperwork to obtain U.S. permanent\nresidency for their son (Ex. 3), which was later granted in about December 2004 (Ex. 1).\nApplicant\u2019s son came to the U.S. twice, and stayed with Applicant for a couple of\nmonths each time (Tr. 53). Applicant\u2019s son returned to Russia permanently in late 2006\nor early 2007. He runs a television advertising company (Ex. 3, Tr. 33, 55). Applicant\ndoes not believe that his son is politically active, although his son has done advertising\nwork for local political campaigns in Russia (Tr. 81). Applicant exchanges electronic mail\nmessages with his son \u201cevery once in awhile\u201d (Tr. 56), about two or three times a year\n(Ex. 3), including on Applicant\u2019s birthday in February 2009 (Tr. 56). Applicant last\ncontacted his son in July or August 2009 about the expiration of his son\u2019s U.S.\npermanent residency status. As of September 2009, Applicant\u2019s son planned to attend\nthe wedding of one of his half-sisters in the U.S. (Tr. 57).\nApplicant has not traveled to either Israel or Russia since he immigrated to the\nU.S. (Tr. 57-58). His spouse has been to Israel at least twice in the past two years,\nincluding in about February 2009, to care for her mother\u2019s apartment and look for\nrenters. Applicant\u2019s spouse stayed with friends while she was in Israel (Tr. 58-59).\nApplicant claims to be unable to recall the names of his spouse\u2019s friends in Israel other\nthan the first name of one woman, who is a music teacher as is his spouse (Tr. 60).\nApplicant is friendly and has occasional (less than once yearly) contact with some\nRussian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Israel and with some former \u201carmy buddies\u201d from his military service\nin Israel (Tr. 61). Applicant also has contact  by email or Skype with former classmates.\nIn May or June 2009, a former classmate about to lose his job with a large nonprofit\norganization in Israel asked Applicant to intercede on his behalf with his supervisor, who\nis a friend of Applicant\u2019s since his days in the Israeli military (Tr. 63). To Applicant\u2019s\nknowledge, none of his friends in Israel works directly for the Israeli government (Tr. 63-\n64), although his friend from the military is responsible for the irrigation needs of an\nentire district in Israel.\n\n7\nApplicant owns his home in the U.S. where he has resided with his immediate\nfamily, including his mother-in-law, since December 2003 (Ex. 1, Tr. 64). Applicant has\nno financial assets in Israel. His spouse opened a bank account in her name during her\nlast trip to Israel to facilitate the transfer of funds concerning her mother\u2019s assets in\nIsrael (Tr. 66). Applicant indicated his spouse\u2019s account could have a balance of about\n$10,000, although he did not know for certain (Tr. 67). His spouse has power of attorney\nover her mother\u2019s property in Israel (Tr. 67). Applicant went to the Israeli consulate to\nobtain this power of attorney for his spouse (Tr. 77). \nApplicant has consistently received excellent performance reviews, especially in\nthe area of technical competency, since he started working for his present employer.\nHe demonstrated a high level of intelligence and innovation, a broad experience base,\nand willingness to work any problem presented to him (Ex. A). Applicant\u2019s supervisor\n(group leader) for the first 18 months or so of Applicant\u2019s employment at the laboratory\nobserved nothing that would lead him to question Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. or ability\nto safeguard sensitive information (Ex. B).\nAfter reviewing the U.S. government publications concerning Israel and the\nRussian Federation, and their respective foreign relations, I take administrative notice of\nthe following facts:\nIsrael\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy of about 7.1 million people. Israel generally\nrespects the human rights of its citizens, although there have been some issues\nrespecting treatment of Palestinian detainees and discrimination against Arab citizens.\nDespite the instability and armed conflict that have marked Israel\u2019s relations within the\nregion since it came into existence, Israel has developed a diversified, technologically\nadvanced market economy focused on high-technology electronic and biomedical\nequipment, chemicals, and transport equipment.\nThe U.S. and Israel have a close friendship based on common democratic\nvalues, religious affinities, and security interests. The U.S. was the first country to\nofficially recognize Israel, only eleven minutes after Israel declared its independence in\n1948. In 1985, Israel and the U.S. concluded a Free Trade Agreement designed to\nstrengthen economic ties by eliminating tariffs. Israel is a prominent recipient of U.S.\naid. Since 1949, the U.S. has provided more than $30 billion in economic assistance to\nIsrael. Between 1976 and 2003, Israel was the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The\nU.S. has also provided Israel with $9 billion in loan guarantees since 2003, which\nenable Israel to borrow money from commercial lenders at a lower rate. In April 1988,\nthe U.S. and Israel established a Joint Economic Development Group to develop the\nIsraeli economy by exchanging views of Israel economic policy planning, stabilization\nefforts, and structural reform.\nIsrael and the U.S. do not have a mutual defense agreement, although the U.S.\nremains committed to Israel\u2019s security and well-being. The U.S. is the principal\n\n8\ninternational proponent of the Arab-Israeli peace process, and has been actively\ninvolved in negotiating an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1989, Israel was one\nof the first countries designated a Major Non-NATO ally. As such, Israel receives\npreferential treatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts and access to expanded\nweapons systems at lower prices. Israel and the U.S. are partners in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d\nmissile defense project, and have concluded numerous treaties and agreements aimed\nat strengthening military ties, including agreements on mutual defense assistance,\nprocurement, and security of information. Israel and the U.S. have established joint\ngroups to further military cooperation. The two countries participate in joint military\nexercises and collaborate on military research and weapons development. The U.S. has\npledged to ensure that Israel maintains a \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d over its neighbors,\nand has been a major source of Israeli military funding. The Omnibus Appropriations\nAct of March 11, 2009, provided $2.38 billion in foreign military financing for Israel.\nStrong congressional support for Israel has resulted in Israel receiving benefits not\navailable to other countries. Israel is permitted to use one-quarter of its foreign military\nassistance grant for procurement spending from Israeli defense companies.\nArms agreements between Israel and the U.S. limit the use of U.S. military\nequipment to defensive purposes. The U.S. has acted to restrict aid and has rebuked\nIsrael in the past for possible improper use of U.S.-supplied military equipment. The\nU.S. is concerned about Israeli settlements; Israel\u2019s sales of sensitive security\nequipment and technology, especially to China; Israel\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S.\nintellectual property; Israel\u2019s suspected use of U.S.-made cluster bombs against civilian\npopulated areas in Lebanon; and espionage-related cases implicating Israeli officials.\nIsraeli military officials have been implicated in economic espionage activity in the U.S.\nU.S. government employees and U.S. government contractors have been implicated in\nproviding classified and sensitive information to Israel. Israel was listed as one of the\nnations that aggressively targeted U.S. economic intelligence as recently as 2000.\nRussian Federation\nRussia is a vast and diverse federation consisting of 84 administrative units.\nPower is concentrated in the executive branch, primarily in the president who appoints\nthe prime minister with parliament\u2019s approval. Russia\u2019s bicameral legislature consists of\na compliant state Duma (lower house), dominated by a progovernment party, and a\nweaker Federation Counsel (upper house). Despite a general tendency to increase\njudicial independence, the judiciary often operates to protect state interests. Russia has\nan uneven human rights record. There is political pressure on the judiciary, restrictions\non the mass media, intolerance of ethnic minorities, corruption and selective\nenforcement of the law, and erosion of accountability of government leaders to the\npopulation. Security forces have been involved in politically motivated abductions,\ndisappearances, and unlawful killings, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, violence or\nother harsh treatment, especially within the North Caucasus region in 2008. Elections to\nthe Duma in December 2007 and to the Russian presidency in March 2008 were\ncriticized by U.S. and European Union observers as unfairly controlled by governing\nauthorities. Political elites have taken the helm of many of Russia\u2019s leading economic\n\n9\nenterprises as assets considered strategic by the Russian government have been re-\nnationalized.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Russia has\nincreased its international profile, taking active steps to become a full partner in the\nworld\u2019s principal political organizations, such as the United Nations. The U.S. and\nRussia share common interest on a broad range of issues, including countering\nterrorism, reducing their strategic arsenals, and stemming the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction. Billions of dollars have also been allocated to aid Russian\ndemocratization and market reform. On the other hand, Russia inherited a significant\nintelligence capability from the former Soviet Union, and continues to focus with\nincreasing sophistication on collecting sensitive and protected U.S. technologies\nthrough its intelligence services. Beyond collection activities and espionage directed at\nthe U.S., Russia provides, in exchange for money or diplomatic influence or both,\ntechnologies that can be used in the construction of weapons of mass destruction to\nother countries, including China, Venezuela, Syria, and Iran. Because of the\ndeterioration of its conventional military forces, Russia is increasingly relying on nuclear\nforces to maintain its status as a major power. Russia remains the most capable cyber-\nthreat to the U.S. It is developing systems and technologies capable of interfering with\nor disabling vital U.S. space-based navigation, communication and intelligence\ncollection capabilities.\nThe relationship between the U.S. and Russia remains complicated. After the\nterrorist attacks of September 2001, the NATO-Russia Council was established, giving\nRussia a voice in NATO discussions. Concerns over domestic developments in Russia,\nand foreign policy differences, including U.S. plans to deploy a ground-based missile\nsystem in Europe with interceptors in Poland and a radar installation in the Czech\nRepublic, led to a strain in U.S.-Russia relations since 2003. Russia\u2019s military invasion\ninto Georgia in August 2008, and its decision to recognize the territories of South\nOssetia and Abkhazia, led to a significant decrease in contacts between the U.S. and\nRussia, and to temporary suspension of the NATO-Russia Council. In September 2008,\nthe U.S. State Department reported that an \u201cenemy image\u201d of the U.S. had been\ncreated in the state-controlled Russian media. Relations between the U.S. and Russia\nhave improved since the Obama Administration as both countries seek to change the\ntone of the relationship and cooperate in areas of mutual interest.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\n\n10\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion in obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\n\n11\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nDespite his dual citizenship status, Applicant maintains that his sole allegiance\nlies with the U.S., where he has lived since about 1988. The concern in this case is not\nwith Applicant\u2019s allegiance or loyalty, but rather whether there is an unacceptable risk of\nundue foreign influence because of his connections to Israel or Russia or both.\nApplicant\u2019s present ties to his native Russia are limited but significant. Applicant\u2019s son\nfrom his first marriage is a resident citizen of Russia (SOR 1.a), where he is, or was as\nrecently as of March 2008, a television personality, and where he runs an advertising\nbusiness. He was of preschool age when Applicant immigrated to Israel, and there is no\nevidence that Applicant maintained ongoing close relations with his son over the years.\nHowever, Applicant acquired U.S. permanent residency for his son. Between about\nDecember 2004 and 2007, Applicant\u2019s son came to the U.S. twice and stayed with\nApplicant for a couple of months each time. Applicant has maintained contact, albeit on\nan infrequent basis (three or four times yearly) but as recently as August 2009, with his\nson after his son returned to Russia permanently. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s military service for Israel (SOR 1.c), and his employment with the\nnuclear research institute in Israel (SOR 1.d), also raise foreign influence concerns,\nnotwithstanding the passage of 20 years since these affiliations. Concerning his past\nmilitary service, Applicant is friendly with an \u201carmy buddy\u201d who oversees  an entire\ndistrict\u2019s water irrigation needs in Israel. As recently as May or June 2009, Applicant\nwas asked to contact this friend and advocate for the continued employment of a former\nclassmate. His ongoing contacts with friends from the military and school implicate AG \u00b6\n7(a).\nOther than denying that he accessed classified information or held a security\nclearance, Applicant has provided little detail about his work in optics for the Israeli\nnuclear research institute. However, it is reasonable to infer that his work was sensitive\nif not classified, given that Israeli agents or officials contacted him annually to ascertain\nwhether he had been asked to divulge \u201csecret\u201d information about the institute or his past\nduties. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d and AG \u00b6 7(h), \u201cindications that\nrepresentatives or nationals from a foreign country are acting to increase the\nvulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion,\u201d are implicated because of these contacts with Israeli officials\nfrom at least 1996 until June 2005.\n\n12\nAG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies because of his mother-in-law\u2019s financial\ninterests in Israel that are being managed by his spouse. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, who\nlives with him and his spouse, receives a widow\u2019s pension from the Israeli government,\nand she owns an apartment in Israel. Either unwilling or incapable of managing these\ninterests herself, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law gave Applicant\u2019s spouse a power of attorney\nto deal with these assets. Applicant\u2019s spouse opened an account in Israel to facilitate\nthe transfer of funds, and she traveled to Israel, including in February 2009, to look for\nrenters for her mother\u2019s apartment. During that visit, she stayed with friends whose\nnames Applicant claims he cannot now recall.\nApplicant\u2019s closest relatives enjoy the protections of U.S. citizenship and\nresidency. Yet, it is difficult to fully satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of\nthe relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located,\nor the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  His\noldest son apparently intends to continue to pursue his career in Russia. Relations\nbetween the U.S. and Russia have improved since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nSome cooperation has been achieved in countering terrorism, reducing strategic\narsenals, and stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Billions of\ndollars have  been allocated to aid Russian democratization and market reform. But\ndomestic developments and human rights abuses in Russia, and foreign policy\ndifferences, have strained relations. Russia inherited a significant intelligence capability\nfrom the former Soviet Union, and continues to focus with increasing sophistication on\ncollecting sensitive and protected U.S. technologies through its intelligence services.\nWhile there is nothing about his son\u2019s advertising activities that involves sensitive or\nclassified information, Applicant\u2019s son has engaged in activities in Russia (as a\ntelevision personality and through his work on political ads) that could raise his visibility\nwith Russian officials, particularly given Russia\u2019s restrictions on the media.\nThe U.S.-Israeli relationship is contrasted by historically close ties. The U.S. is\ncommitted to Israel\u2019s security, to the extent of ensuring that Israel maintains a\n\u201cqualitative military edge\u201d in the region. Israel receives preferential treatment in bidding\nfor U.S. defense contracts and substantial economic aid from the U.S. But this close\nfriendship has not prohibited Israel from aggressively targeting U.S. economic\nintelligence and U.S. classified and sensitive information. Applicant was repeatedly\ncontacted by Israeli officials or agents between 1996 and June 2005 concerning\nwhether he had been improperly approached for sensitive information about his work in\nIsrael. He was contacted before and after, if not also while, he worked for a U.S.\ndefense contractor. There is no evidence that Applicant disclosed any U.S. sensitive or\nproprietary information, or that these foreign contacts continued after June 2005. But he\ndid not report these foreign contacts until after he was confronted by the FBI. AG \u00b6 8(e),\n\u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding the\nreporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations from a\n\n13\nforeign country,\u201d cannot be relied on to mitigate the foreign influence concerns raised by\nhis repeated contacts with Israeli agents or officials concerning his sensitive work in\nIsrael. \nApplicant\u2019s subsequent cooperation with the FBI is in his favor, but fewer than\nfive years have passed since the Israelis last approached him about whether others\nwere seeking information about sensitive matters related to his work for the Israeli\nnuclear institute. If Applicant is to be believed, he did not realize that the contacts by\nIsraeli officials or agents were significant. He has not demonstrated that he would\nrecognize, even now, an attempt to gain influence. Past history shows that when he was\nasked by Israeli officials or agents about his plans to relocate, he provided the\ninformation willingly. Despite his considerable ties to the U.S. developed since about\n1989 (career, citizenship, home ownership), I am unable to apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) or 8(b),\n\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d is not pertinent. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his son in Russia are infrequent\nbut not casual. As of August 2009, Applicant was in contact with his son concerning his\nson\u2019s loss of his \u201cgreen card\u201d because his son intends to attend his half-sister\u2019s wedding\nin the U.S. Furthermore, Applicant has close and continuing relations with his spouse\nand mother-in-law, who have Israeli citizenship and are concerned with financial assets\nin Israel.\nApplicant described his mother-in-law\u2019s pension from Israel as \u201ca very small\npension, like several hundred dollars\u201d (Tr. 34). He provided little information about her\napartment in Israel. It is unclear whether his mother-in-law relies on these foreign\nsources to cover any living expenses in the U.S. since she resides with Applicant and\nhis family. Foreign assets may be mitigated if they are routine or so minimal to be an\nunlikely source of pressure or influence. See AG 8(f) (stating, \u201cthe value or routine\nnature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are\nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate,\nor pressure the individual\u201d). Applicant went to the Israeli consulate to obtain a power of\nattorney for his spouse so that she could handle her mother\u2019s financial interests in\nIsrael. His spouse traveled to Israel more than once, including in February 2009, to\nhandle matters involving the apartment. During this trip, she opened her own bank\naccount in Israel to facilitate transfer of her mother\u2019s monetary assets there. The\nongoing concern with the foreign assets makes it difficult to apply AG \u00b6 8(f). None of the\nmitigating conditions apply to mitigate the very substantial foreign influence concerns in\nthis case.\n\n14\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the\ntotality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nAs set forth under Guideline B, supra, Applicant has significant ties to Russia and\nto Israel that present a heightened risk of undue foreign influence. Countervailing strong\npersonal ties to the U.S. are undisputed. He has chosen to make the U.S. his home for\nthe past 20 years. He acquired U.S. citizenship in October 1998. He has not traveled to\nIsrael or to Russia since he immigrated to the U.S. Despite his dual citizenship, he took\nno steps to renew his Israeli passport after 1996, and his expired foreign passport was\nshredded by his employer. His contributions to his employer also must be considered in\nthe \u201cwhole-person\u201d evaluation. A coworker has observed nothing that would lead him to\nquestion Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. Applicant may have the best of intentions and yet be\nin an untenable position of potentially having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign country or foreign national and the interests of the U.S. Serious foreign influence\nconcerns preclude me from concluding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n15\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 26, 2008. On \nOctober 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines G, E, and F. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nJune 7, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 19, 2009; answered it in an undated \ndocument; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on November 23, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nDecember 3, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on January 19, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on January 27, 2010, scheduling the hearing for February 18, \n2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel submitted a \ndemonstrative exhibit summarizing the evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and it \nwas marked as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I and attached to the record. Applicant testified, \npresented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough H, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until March 5, \n2010, to enable her to submit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted \nAX I through Q. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX I through Q are \nattached to the record as HX II. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February \n26, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.c, \n2.a, 3.b-3.f, 3.i, 3.k, and 3.l. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old technical writer for a federal contractor. She has \nworked for her current employer since January 2008. She married in December 1978, \ndivorced in June 1980, remarried in June 1984, and divorced in December 1990. She \nhas two adult sons. She received a clearance in January 1980 while she was employed \nby a defense contractor. She does not hold a current security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in November 1996. \nShe pleaded guilty and entered an accelerated rehabilitative disposition program. The \nprogram consisted of six weeks of alcohol education classes, but no evaluation or \ntreatment. She completed it, and her arrest record was expunged. (AX C; Tr. 70-71.) \n \n \nApplicant cohabited with a man for about 17 years after her last divorce. When \nher cohabitant left her in January 2007, the breakup was emotionally difficult for \nApplicant. After her cohabitant left her, she discovered he had been hiding unpaid bills. \n(Tr. 75-78.) She began falling further into financial difficulty because there were no \nlonger two incomes to cover her financial obligations. (GX 2 at 5.) She also began \nconsuming alcohol to excess, usually drinking alone at home. (Tr. 74.) \n \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI). She \nhad been drinking with friends, started to drive home, realized she was drunk, pulled off \nthe road, and fell asleep in her car. (GX 4; Tr. 72.) Her blood-alcohol level was .10 per \ncent. The prosecutor reduced the alleged blood-alcohol level to .08 per cent, and she \npleaded guilty to misdemeanor DUI. She paid a fine and was required to attend an \nalcohol education class, but she did not receive any evaluation or treatment for alcohol \n\n \n3 \n \n \nabuse or alcohol dependence. (GX 2 at 8.) She completed a highway safety and \nintervention program in October 2007. (AX F.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her most recent security clearance application, she \ndisclosed her April 2007 DUI arrest, but she did not disclose her 1996 arrest. She \nexplained that she misunderstood the question and believed that she was required to \nreport only arrests that occurred in the seven years preceding her application. (Tr. 59, \n92.) I found her explanation plausible and credible. \n \n \nIn October 2008, after Applicant realized that she was about to lose her home \nwhere she had lived for 25 years, she drank to excess and was arrested again for DUI. \n(GX 8.) She notified her facility security officer of her arrest and asked her employer for \ntime off to receive alcohol rehabilitation treatment. (Tr. 97.) She pleaded guilty to DUI \nwith a blood-alcohol level of .15 percent. She was sentenced to 30 days in jail, with \ncredit for time served, a $750 fine, and 48 hours of community service. She was placed \non probation, required to surrender her driver\u2019s license, and required to undergo \nrehabilitative treatment. (GX 2 at 30-31.)  \n \nApplicant completed a three-day detoxification program on December 27-29, \n2008, and an inpatient treatment program from January 16 to February 13, 2009. There \nis no evidence of a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. However, upon \nher discharge from the inpatient program, a medical doctor\u2019s prognosis was \u201cFair, if \npatient follows through with aftercare recommendations.\u201d (GX 2 at 27-28.) \n \nApplicant then entered an intensive outpatient treatment program, requiring \ntherapy sessions three times a week. She completed the program in May 2009. There is \nno evidence of a diagnosis, but she received a \u201cfavorable\u201d prognosis from a certified \nalcohol counselor, conditioned on continued use of her established support systems. \nShe then completed another outpatient program requiring group therapy once a week \nfor about six weeks. (Tr. 81-83; GX 2 at 29.)  \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not consumed alcohol for a year, and \nshe was attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings once or twice a week. (Tr. 63, \n80, 83.) She was released from probation in November 2009, and she expects that her \ndriver\u2019s license will be returned to her in June 2010. (Tr. 90.)  \n \n \nApplicant began falling behind on her home mortgage payments in February \n2007. She was laid off from her job in December 2007 until she started her current job \nin January 2008. (GX 1 at 11-13; GX 2 at 5.) At some time during this period, she \nsuffered a \u201cTIA\u201d1, which she described as a \u201cminor stroke.\u201d She did not suffer any \npermanent neurological injury, but she incurred medical bills. (Tr. 64-65.)  \n \nForeclosure proceedings on Applicant\u2019s home were started several times \nbetween June 2008 and September 2008. She completed a \u201cshort sale\u201d of her home in \n                                                          \n1  A TIA is a mild cerebrovascular stroke with reversible symptoms that last from a few minutes to several \nhours. Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary (4th ed. 2009) at p. 1495. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nNovember 2008, settling the mortgage debt for less than the full balance. (AX E and G.) \nShe now lives in a rented apartment. The defaulted mortgage was not alleged in the \nSOR. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports for March 2008, May 2009, and December 2009 \nreflect the 13 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (GX 5; GX 6; GX 7.) Applicant \ntestified the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 3.a was for her son\u2019s medical treatment and had \nbeen paid, but she provided no documentation of payment. (Tr. 101.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified she made payments in 2008 on the utility bill in SOR \u00b6 3.b and \nwas trying to negotiate a settlement agreement, but she had not reached any \nagreement. (Tr. 102-03.) She testified she submitted the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 3.c to \nher insurance company, but her claim was denied because it was for treatment of a \npreexisting condition. She disputed the denial in 2007, but she had no further contact \nwith the doctors or the insurance company. (Tr. 99-100.) She provided no documentary \nevidence of her payments, negotiations, or disputes. \n \nApplicant has not resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d. She provided a letter \nfrom the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.e stating that the account was paid in full, but it \nrefers to a different account from the debt alleged in the SOR. (AX K; AX L.) She \nsubmitted the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 3.f to her insurance company in 2005, but it has \nnot been resolved. (Tr. 106.) She has not contacted the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.g. \n(Tr. 108.) She could not identify the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.h (Tr. 109-10.) She \ntestified that she made payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.i, that the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 3.j was paid, that the debt alleged in SOR 3.k was consolidated with another \ndebt, and that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.i was paid, but she provided no \ndocumentation for any of these transactions. (Tr. 110-18.)  \n \nApplicant testified that she paid about $300 on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.m \n(Tr. 119.) She provided no documentation of payment, but she submitted a settlement \noffer dated October 7, 2009. (AX M.) There is no evidence that she accepted the offer.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is about $2,000, and her expenses are about \n$1,700, leaving a net remainder of $300. (Tr. 119-24.) She has about $2,000 in savings \nand more than $1,000 in her retirement account. She admitted that she had not \naddressed her delinquent debts until recently because she was not acting responsibly \nduring 2007 and 2008, and it was not until 2009 that she \u201ccame back to [her] senses.\u201d \n(Tr. 125.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s close friend for about 12 years, a retired police officer with 25 years of \nexperience in law enforcement, testified that Applicant began drinking heavily because \nof stress from the breakup of her 17-year relationship, being laid off from her job, and \nher financial problems. The witness testified that Applicant is hard working and \ntrustworthy. Before the stressful events, Applicant did not abuse alcohol and appeared \nto have her life under control. (Tr. 49-56.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe president of the company for whom Applicant works has known her for two \nyears. He describes her as a woman of integrity, devoted to her family and work, \norganized, efficient, competent, and an employee with high initiative. (AX B.) Applicant\u2019s \nproject manager also describes her as a woman of integrity, intelligence, competence, \nand dedication. (AX Q.) The facility security officer for Applicant\u2019s employer has known \nher for two years and considers her a hard worker, a person of integrity, and security \nconscious. (AX A.) Applicant completed information assurance awareness training in \nAugust 2008, and she received a certificate of achievement in November 2008. (AX O \nand P.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant was arrested for DUI in April 2007; pleaded guilty; \nwas sentenced to probation for six months, fines and fees totaling about $972; and was \nrequired to complete alcohol education and intervention classes. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges she \nwas arrested for DUI in October 2008. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant\u2019s excessive \nconsumption of alcohol required alcohol detoxification and inpatient treatment, and that \nshe was discharged from treatment with a fair prognosis dependent on compliance with \naftercare recommendations. She admitted all three allegations in her answer to the \nSOR and at the hearing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest for DUI in 1996 was not alleged in the SOR. Thus, it may not \nbe considered as an independent basis for denying her a clearance. However, it may be \nconsidered to assess her credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative \nguideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; to consider whether she has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or \nas part of a whole person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006) (citations omitted). I have considered her 1996 arrest only for these limited \npurposes. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Two disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence . . . , regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent); and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s record of DUI arrests raises AG \u00b6 22(a). Her level of intoxication \nwhen she was arrested for DUI and her testimony about her drinking habits raise AG \u00b6 \n22(c).  \n \n \nThe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), (e), and (f) would be raised if there \nwere a diagnosis or evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. Although \nApplicant\u2019s medical records contain a prognosis by a medical doctor and another by a \ncounselor, the records do not reflect a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence. Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), (e) and (f) are not raised. \n \n \nSince the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated behavior was frequent and did not occur under circumstances making it unlikely \nto recur. Thus, the focus is on the first prong (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d). There are no \nAbright line@ rules for determining how much time must pass to establish this prong of \nAG \u00b6 23(a). The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of \nthe evidence. If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). \n \n \nOn the date of the hearing, Applicant had abstained from alcohol for about a year \nand was regularly participating in AA. A year is a \u201csignificant period of time.\u201d On the \nother hand, her history of alcohol related conduct dates back to 1996. She did not \ncomplete her probation until November 2009, and her driving privileges are not yet \nrestored. In explaining her financial difficulties, she admitted that she was not acting \nresponsibly in 2007 and 2008, and it was not until 2009 that she \u201ccame back to [her] \nsenses.\u201d I conclude Applicant has not had insufficient time to demonstrate that she will \ncontinue to maintain her sobriety. It is too soon to conclude that she is rehabilitated. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant has \nacknowledged her excessive alcohol consumption and had taken significant steps to \novercome her problems with alcohol, but insufficient time has passed to establish a \npattern of abstinence. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual is a \ncurrent employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no \nhistory of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n23(c). Applicant receives credit under this mitigating condition, because she is \ncontinuing her aftercare program and is making progress. She has no \u201chistory of \nprevious treatment and relapse,\u201d because her DUI arrests in 1996 and 2007 were \nfollowed by alcohol and safety education, but no medical evaluation or treatment.  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n23(d) if -- \n \nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  \n \nThis mitigating condition is partially established. Applicant successfully completed \nextensive inpatient and outpatient treatment and is complying with the aftercare \nrequirements. As noted above in the discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b), she has not had \nsufficient time to demonstrate a \u201cclear and established pattern\u201d of abstinence. The \nprognosis by a medical doctor was \u201cfair,\u201d which is marginally favorable. The prognosis \nby a counselor was more positive, but the record does not demonstrate the counselor\u2019s \nqualifications sufficiently to establish that he is the equivalent of a licensed clinical social \nworker.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant falsified her security clearance application by \nintentionally failing to disclose her DUI arrest in 1996. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that she failed \nto disclose her DUI arrest in October 2008 during an interview with a security \ninvestigator.  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw SOR \u00b6 2.b in light of evidence that the \nDUI arrest occurred after the interview. (Tr. 131-32.) I have granted the motion to \nwithdraw \u00b6 2.b, and I have reflected the withdrawal in my formal findings. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this \ncase, the Government has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does \nnot prove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant testified that she misunderstood the question about previous arrests \nand believed that she needed to report only those arrests that occurred in the seven \nyears preceding her application. She was open and candid throughout the hearing, \neven when discussing painful and embarrassing events. I am satisfied that she did not \nintentionally falsify her security clearance application, and I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.a in her \nfavor. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are recent and numerous, but they occurred largely because of the \n\n \n10 \n \n \nbreakup of her 17-year relationship, leaving her solely responsible for numerous debts \nthat were jointly incurred. However, instead of acting aggressively to resolve her \nfinancial problems, she lapsed into a period of alcohol abuse and neglect of her \nfinancial obligations. This mitigating condition is not completely established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant had a short period of \nunemployment before she began her current job, which exacerbated her financial \nproblems caused by her domestic breakup. She also incurred unexpected medical bills \nafter her mild stroke. However, she admitted at the hearing that she did not act \nresponsibly during 2007 and 2008. Thus, this mitigating condition is not completely \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling and her problems are not yet under control. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish resolution of each and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case \nNo. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that \nan applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. Id.  \n \nApplicant testified she paid or made payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n3.a, 3.b, 3.i, 3.l, and 3.m, but she submitted no documentation of any payments. She \ndoes not have a concrete plan to resolve her debts. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ntestified she disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c, but she provided no documentation \nof the dispute. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who suffered significant emotional and financial \nsetbacks shortly before starting her current job. She previously held a clearance while \nemployed by a defense contractor. She has the respect and support of her current \nemployer. She has taken significant steps to prevent further alcohol-related problems. \nWith the passage of time, she may well be able to demonstrate that she has overcome \nthem. \n \n \nUnfortunately, Applicant\u2019s financial problems went largely unresolved while she \ndealt with her alcohol-related problems. Her first priority on financial matters was to \navoid foreclosure on her home. She appears to have resolved that problem through a \nshort sale. Her testimony reflected some piecemeal attempts at dealing with selected \ncreditors, but she has no overall plan to resolve the debts alleged in the SOR. \nImportantly, she has not provided documentary evidence of her actions, even though \nshe testified she had the necessary documentation and was given additional time to \nproduce it. She has sufficient income to begin addressing the debts in the SOR, now \nthat the home foreclosure issue has been resolved. With more time, she may be able to \ngain control of the financial disarray she now faces. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37 through \nE3.1.40 (reconsideration authorized after one year). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, E, \nand F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has refuted the personal conduct allegations, but she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on alcohol consumption and financial considerations. \n\n \n12 \n \n \nAccordingly, she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant (withdrawn) \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F (Financial Considerations); AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On July 6, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant retired after serving almost 22 years as an officer in the Taiwanese\nNavy. His brother, who remains in Taiwan, also served for 20 years. Both ended their\ncareers as department directors at Taiwan\u2019s Naval Technology Development Center.\nHe and his second wife became U.S. citizens in 2006, but remain dual citizens of\nTaiwan and have close family members who are resident citizens there. The evidence is\ninsufficient to mitigate resulting security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 23, 2007.  On\n1\nJuly 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nMarch 30, 2010\n\nItem 3.\n3\nThe Government submitted six Items in support of the SOR allegations, and 15 U.S. Government source\n4\ndocuments in support of a request for administrative notice of facts concerning Taiwan. \nItem 4.\n5\nItem 3.\n6\nItem 5.\n7\n2\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within\nthe Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 29, 2009, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.3\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 27, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non September 21, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He submitted written comments\nclarifying and updating certain facts in response to the FORM on October 13, 2009, and\nexpressed no objection to my consideration of the evidence submitted by Department\nCounsel or to my taking administrative notice of facts concerning Taiwan. On October\n19, 2009, Department Counsel stated that she had no objection to my consideration of\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM. I received the case assignment on November 12,\n2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served as an\nofficer in the Taiwanese Navy from August 1977 to March 1999. He has never held a\nU.S. security clearance. He is married for the second time, with three children, ages 26,\n18, and 16.  In his response to the SOR, he formally admitted each allegation.\n5\n6\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, including his statements in response to DOHA interrogatories,7\nare incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant was born and raised in Taiwan. He attended post-graduate school at a\nU.S. university from 1990 to 1995. During his final tour of duty in the Taiwanese Navy,\nhe served as a department director at the Naval Technology Development Center in\nTaiwan. For the first eight months after he retired from the Taiwanese Navy, he worked\nas Management Information Services (MIS) Manager for a large U.S.-based accounting\nand consulting firm in Taiwan.

In May 2001, he took a similar\nposition with a different private company that lasted for two months. From July 2001 to\nJuly 2002, he was unemployed, after which he was self-employed as a software\nconsultant for 16 months. Another private company hired him as a senior software\nengineer during January and February 2004, following which he was unemployed for\nanother six months. He resumed self-employment as a software consultant from August\n2004 to August 2006. He then moved to a different state to accept employment as a\nsenior database administrator for two succeeding contractors at his current location.  \n8\nApplicant was married to his first wife from 1983 to 1988. They had one child in\n1983, who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan living with his mother. During the five\nyears Applicant was in the United States for postgraduate school, he had two additional\nchildren. They are both native-born U.S. citizens, and reside with his current wife in their\nhome in the state where he first settled in 1999. At least one of them holds dual\ncitizenship with Taiwan. Applicant married his current wife in Taiwan during 1999,\nshortly before they moved to the United States. She was also born and raised in\nTaiwan. They both became naturalized U.S. citizens on September 20, 2006, and hold\ndual citizenship with Taiwan.9\nApplicant\u2019s mother (age 78), father (age 84), sister (age 53), brother (age 49),\nson (age 26), and mother-in-law (age 73) are all citizens and residents of Taiwan.\nApplicant\u2019s older brother (age 56) and his wife are Taiwanese citizens, who were\ngranted permanent resident status in the United States in March 2008, and now reside\nhere.  Applicant\u2019s younger brother also served as an officer in the Taiwanese Navy for\n10\n20 years. His final position there was also as a department director at the Naval\nTechnology Development Center. Applicant went to Taiwan in November 2008 to visit\nhis mother.   \n11\nApplicant stated that he receives no pension, retirement pay, or other form of\npayment from Taiwan despite being retired from their navy after almost 22 years of\nservice. He said he has no financial assets there. Although he was either unemployed\nor self-employed as a consultant for all but one month of the five years between July\n2001 and August 2006, he has no delinquent debts and claims a net worth of\n$100,000.  He was issued a Taiwanese passport in April 2004, because his previous\n12\npassport expired and he was not yet a U.S. citizen. That passport was destroyed by his\nFacility Security Officer in October 2008.  \n13\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM.\n14\nItem 5, Part 3, Question 23. \n15\n4\nApplicant stated, \u201cIf there is a confliction [sic] of interests between United States\nand any other countries, my first and foremost concern would be United States, where\nmy most important relatives, my wife, my daughter, and my son, live.\u201d  He also stated\n14\nthat there is no person, group, or organization in a foreign country to which he owes a\nduty, obligation, or responsibility (personal, family, social, professional) that he would be\nexpected to honor or perform if he was asked to do so.  He provided no evidence\n15\nconcerning the quality of his professional performance, the level of responsibility his\nduties entail, or his track record with respect to handling sensitive information and\nobservation of security procedures. He submitted no character references or other\nevidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable\nto evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his\ncase decided without a hearing. \nI take administrative notice of the facts concerning Taiwan that are set forth in\nPart III of the FORM. Of particular significance are the facts that Taiwan is among the\nmost active collectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information, and has been\ninvolved with numerous attempts to illegally acquire restricted U.S. technology.\nMoreover, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) maintains substantial intelligence\ncollection activities in Taiwan. The primary mission of Taiwan\u2019s military is the defense of\nTaiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and which has not\nrenounced the use of force against Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Defense has stated\nthat acquiring submarines, a move directed at the PRC, remains a top priority. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established two\nforeign influence DCs: \n\n6\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nAlthough not asserted by Department Counsel, AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a\nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion;\u201d was also\nraised by substantial evidence.\nTaiwan is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information, and has a\nsignificant interest in acquiring defense-related and advanced naval technology. The\nPRC also has substantial intelligence operations active in Taiwan. Accordingly, family\nand professional connections there have more potential to generate heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)\nand (d) than would similar connections in many other countries. \nApplicant shares living quarters with his wife, whose mother is a resident citizen\nof Taiwan. His father, mother, brother, sister, and eldest child are also resident citizens\nof Taiwan. These immediate-family relationships are all presumed to be close and\nloving, and Applicant offered no evidence to the contrary. Both he and his brother\nserved more than 20 years as officers in the Taiwanese Navy, culminating as directors\nof major departments at Taiwan\u2019s Naval Technology Development Center. Applicant\u2019s\nclaim that he owes no personal, family, or professional duty, obligation, or responsibility\nto anyone in Taiwan is not credible in light of his history of successful and honorable\nservice in that nation\u2019s defense and ties to family there.\nThese facts meet the Government\u2019s burden of production by raising all three of\nthe aforementioned foreign influence DCs. Applicant\u2019s contacts, relationships, and\nconnections with Taiwan, and his lengthy naval service there culminating in naval\ntechnology development, shift a heavy burden to him to prove mitigation under\napplicable Appeal Board precedent. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with\npotential application in mitigating AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 (a), (b), and (d) security concerns are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\n\n7\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nApplicant did not demonstrate that it is unlikely that he could be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government\nand those of the United States due to his professional history and family ties in Taiwan.\nHe has close relationships with his parents, siblings, mother-in-law, and child, all of\nwhom are resident citizens there, and visited his mother in November 2008.\nAccordingly, he failed to establish the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) and\n(c).\nThe evidence also fails to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). Applicant\nasserted that his \u201cfirst and most concern\u201d in any conflict of interest situation would be for\nthe United States because his wife and two younger children live here. That statement\nis not corroborated, and is significantly weakened by the remaining record evidence.\nApplicant dedicated almost 22 years to the military defense of Taiwan, and most of his\nimmediate family is still there. He has no record of service or sacrifice for the United\nStates that would demonstrate any deep or longstanding relationships or loyalties under\nAppeal Board precedent. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Security concerns do not\ninvolve any personal misconduct, dishonesty, irresponsibility, or disloyal activity. The\nprimary whole-person issues of concern under these circumstances are his\nrelationships with Taiwanese relatives, and his personal connection to Taiwan where he\nwas born and lived for the first 44 years of his life. For almost 22 of those years, he\nserved as an officer in the Taiwanese Navy, and became a specialist in naval\ntechnology development, as did his brother. It would be unrealistic to conclude that he\nhas no ongoing obligations and loyalties toward his family members and former\ncolleagues in Taiwan, and he provided insufficient evidence to support such a finding.\nThese considerations raise the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\nand the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 2 (8) and (9).)\nApplicant offered no evidence of professional, social, or financial ties to the\nUnited States that might weigh in favor of a whole-person finding of exceptional\nallegiance to United States interests. He also provided no evidence, beyond his\nsuccessful Taiwanese naval service, tending to establish his responsibility,\ntrustworthiness, or reliability. His claim that he has no ongoing financial ties with Taiwan\nare doubtful given his status as a retired naval officer and his absence of delinquent\ndebt after supporting a family of four during a five-year period of unemployment and\nself-employment as a software consultant from 2001 to 2006.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from foreign influence considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant, except that \n  one brother is a U.S. resident.\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 21, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nE and F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 18, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 22, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 31, 2009. I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nscheduled on September 2, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and did not offer any \nexhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 10, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.o, 2.a, \nand 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and has worked as an Information Specialist with a \nfederal contractor for a year and a half. He held a top secret clearance with access to \nsensitive compartmented information. He is not married and has a four-year-old child for \nwhom he pays child support. He graduated from high school in 1998, and served in the \nAir Force from 1998 to 2002, when he was honorably discharged in the pay grade E-4.1  \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant was working two jobs and was earning approximately \n$120,000 annually for a period of two years. He bought a house for $110,000. He \nbought a luxury vehicle for $42,000. The value of his house increased approximately \n$50,000 to $60,000, so he decided to buy another house. That house cost $760,000. \nHe took out a second mortgage on the first house to pay for the second house. He \nrented the first house. The monthly expenses on the second house were $5,000 a \nmonth, which included the mortgage and utilities. His total payments for both houses \nper month were approximately $7,000. He obtained a line of credit of $10,000 on a \ncredit card and another line from a credit union for approximately $10,000 to $15,000. \nHe used both of these resources to maintain the payments on his houses. He was \nforced to sell the first house at the end of 2003 or beginning of 2004. He lost money \nbecause he had a second mortgage on the house. He also sold the second house and \ndid not make a profit.2  \n \n \nApproximately eight months ago, he was in discussions with his credit union to \nbegin a repayment plan on SOR \u00b6 1.k, his vehicle debt, but he has not followed through. \nHe stated the reason was because he and the mother of his child no longer live together \nand he now pays child support. He no longer works two jobs.3  \n \n \nApplicant has five judgments against him (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a for $400 was a civil \ndispute; 1.b for $4,489, 1.c for $10,201, 1.d for $15,000, are all credit card debts; and \n1.e for $3,100 is a rental agreement dispute). He has not paid any of the judgments.4  \n \n \n1 Tr. 36-40. \n \n2 Tr. 19-28, 59-61. \n \n3 Tr. 27-28. \n \n4 Tr. 65-70, 77-79. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant believes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($4,265) is the same debt as the \njudgment in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,100). He stated he vacated his apartment and did not \nprovide the proper notice. He went to court and was ordered to pay $3,100. He did not \nprovide any documentation to substantiate his position. Neither debt nor judgment is \npaid.5 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,318) is a credit card debt on which Applicant defaulted \nin 2005. The debt is not paid.6 \n \n \nApplicant is unfamiliar with the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. ($2,303). He did not take any \naction to determine the identity of the creditor or dispute the debt. The debt is not paid.7 \n \n \nApplicant is unfamiliar with the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($426) and did not research the \nidentity of the creditor or dispute it. The debt is not paid.8 \n \n \nApplicant believes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,705) is likely a credit card debt. It is \nunpaid.9  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($17,000) is a car loan. Applicant purchased a new \nHummer vehicle for $42,000, in approximately 2002. His monthly payments with \ninsurance were $1,200. It was repossessed sometime in 2004 or 2005. The debt is not \npaid.10  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($1,887) is for purchases from an electronics store. \nApplicant does not recall what he purchased. He has not paid the debt.11 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m is a tax lien ($5,936) that was filed in August 2006. \nApplicant admitted he knew he was delinquent in paying his taxes, but did not know the \nexact amount. He admitted he did not file his federal income taxes on time for tax years \n2004, 2005, 2006, or 2007. He stated he eventually filed three tax years at one time (he \ncould not remember which years). Some of his taxes were filed a couple of years late, \nothers just one year late. He has not yet filed his 2008 federal tax return. He stated he \nwould claim between seven and nine exemptions because he needed the money. He \nsaid he intended to change the high number of exemptions later in the year, but never \n \n5 Tr. 41-51; GE 5, 7. \n \n6 Tr. 70. \n \n7 Tr. 70; GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. 70-71. \n \n9 Tr. 71.  \n \n10 Tr. 71-73. \n \n11 Tr. 73-74. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ndid because he continued to need the money. He never got around to filing or paying \nhis taxes. He contacted the IRS, but could not afford to pay the amount of taxes they \nproposed in a repayment plan. He has not paid his back taxes.12  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that none of his state taxes were filed on time. He has not \nfiled his 2008 state tax return. He did not file his state tax returns on time in 2004, 2005 \n2006, or 2007. He believed he filed three or four years at the same time. He did not pay \nany state taxes from 2004 to 2008. It is unclear whether he owed state taxes, but he \nstated he put off paying his taxes and never did so because he was irresponsible.13 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($240) is an electric bill. It is not paid.14 \n \n \nApplicant denies the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. ($1,495). This debt is owed to a cell \nphone company. He believed his bill was incorrect and should have been under $100. \nHe contacted the company at the time he received the bill to dispute it over the phone. \nAt first he was told it would be corrected and then he was told it was the correct amount \nand he needed to pay it. He continued to dispute it over the phone. He terminated his \nservice and never resolved the disputed debt. He did not dispute it in writing or with the \ncredit bureau.15 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p ($226) is owed to a car insurance company. Applicant \nfailed to pay the last month of his insurance before his car was repossessed.16  \n \n \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) on April 21, 2008. \nHe failed to list under Section 27.c that he had a tax lien filed against him in 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation was that he knew he did not pay his taxes, but thought the \nquestion dealt with whether there was a lien against real property. Applicant also failed \nto list in Section 27.d that he had judgments against him. He stated at the time he \ncompleted his SCA, he was unaware that some of his debts had been reduced to \njudgments. Applicant listed that he had debts delinquent over 180 days and past due 90 \ndays on his SCA, but did not list all of his debts. I find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. I \nfind there is not enough evidence to conclude Applicant deliberately and intentionally \nfailed to disclose his tax lien and judgments.17  \n \n \n12 Tr. 29-35, 61-65. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal tax returns and state tax returns on time is \nnot considered for disqualifying purposes, but will be considered when analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n13 Tr. 108-114. \n \n14 Tr. 75. \n \n15 Tr. 52-58; GE 4, 5. \n \n16 Tr. 75-76. \n \n17 Tr. 84-102; GE 1 \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant stated his father died in 2007, and he was helping his mother, which \naffected his finances. He had difficulty focusing on his job and left it by mutual \nagreement with his employer.18 He also noted that when he began paying child support \nit impacted his finances. 19  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n18 GE 1. \n \n19 Tr. 114-119; GE 2. \n\n \n6 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nSince approximately 2001, Applicant has accumulated more than $69,900 in \ndelinquent debts that he has not taken any action to pay or resolve. He bought a luxury \ncar while he was attempting to finance two houses. I find there is sufficient evidence to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control\u201d); and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant purchased a house when he was working two jobs and earning a high \nsalary. He then bought another house and had to take out a second mortgage on the \nfirst house in order to make both payments. During this time he also bought a very \nexpensive vehicle. He eventually sold the houses, but did not make a profit. He no \nlonger was working two jobs and earning a high income. He used credit cards and lines \nof credit to pay some of his bills. He has not paid any of his delinquent debts. He does \nnot have a payment plan to pay his debts. He has not received any financial counseling. \nHe had judgments entered against him that remain unpaid.  Although his father died in \n2007, and he had child support to pay, those factors were not the cause of his financial \nproblems. They may have put an extra burden on him, but he did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Therefore, mitigating condition (b) only marginally applies. I \nfind none of the other above mitigating conditions applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n8 \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant failed to list on his SCA a lien placed against him for unpaid taxes. He \ncredibly testified that he was confused and believed the question addressed whether \nthere was a lien placed against real property. He did not believe he had a lien against \nany real property so he answered no. I find his explanation reasonable and that he did \nnot intentionally or deliberately omit relevant facts from his SCA. \n \n \nApplicant failed to list on his SCA judgments that had been filed against him. He \nlisted he had debts over 180 days delinquent and 90 days past due. He explained he \nknew about the delinquent debts, but was unaware some were judgments. I find \nApplicant\u2019s explanation was credible and he did not intentionally or deliberately omit \nrelevant facts from his SCA. Therefore, I find no disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was working two jobs and \nearning a high income for approximately two years. He bought a house he could afford \nand its value increased. He bought a second house he could not afford. He took out a \nsecond mortgage on the first house and began using credit cards and lines of credit to \npay his bills. He purchased a luxury vehicle that he could not afford. He accumulated \nmore than $69,900 in delinquent debt. Applicant already had grave financial problems \nwhen his father died in 2007. He left his job by mutual agreement because he had \ndifficulty focusing on his work. He does not have a plan for managing the debt and it \nremains unpaid and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s conduct raises questions about his \njudgment and reliability. Applicant disclosed on his SCA that he had debts over 180 \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndays delinquent and 90 days past due. He was confused by the wording of the SCA and \ndid not list a lien. He credibly testified he was unaware of the judgments against him, so \nhe did not list them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concern raised under Guideline E, Personal \nConduct, but failed to mitigate the security concern under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 37 years old. He emigrated from Jordan to the U.S. in March 1999. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2008. He was married in Jordan in June 1999. His wife is a Jordanian citizen. She has permanent residency status in the U.S. and lives in Jordan. He has two children. His nine-year-old daughter and six year old son are dual citizens of Jordan and the U.S. His six-year-old son was born in the U.S. A non-Jordanian citizen is required to pay a daily fee to live in the country. So Applicant applied for dual citizenship for his son, so he would not have to pay the fee. Both of his children have Jordanian passports and live with their mother in Jordan. His wife intends on applying for U.S. citizenship when she is eligible. Applicant worked as a linguist recruiter.1 Applicant\u2019s wife entered the U.S. on a travel visa after they married. Applicant had a green card at the time. His wife was required to return to Jordan after her visa expired. He applied for a spouse visa, which she received. From 2004 to 2005, she lived for approximately one year in the U.S. and six months in Jordan. She last visited the U.S. in July 2009, for two months.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nB and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 19, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The government amended the SOR on July 23, \n2009. Applicant answered the amended SOR on August 3, 2009. The case was \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nassigned to me on August 5, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 19, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 25, 2009. The government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through VI for \nadministrative notice. Applicant did not object; the exhibits were admitted; and I took \nadministrative notice as requested. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough H, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on October 1, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g and 1.i. He \ndenied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h and 2.a. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old. He emigrated from Jordan to the U.S. in March 1999. \nHe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2008. He was married in Jordan in \nJune 1999. His wife is a Jordanian citizen. She has permanent residency status in the \nU.S. and lives in Jordan. He has two children. His nine-year-old daughter and six year \nold son are dual citizens of Jordan and the U.S. His six-year-old son was born in the \nU.S. A non-Jordanian citizen is required to pay a daily fee to live in the country. So \nApplicant applied for dual citizenship for his son, so he would not have to pay the fee. \nBoth of his children have Jordanian passports and live with their mother in Jordan. His \nwife intends on applying for U.S. citizenship when she is eligible. Applicant worked as a \nlinguist recruiter.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife entered the U.S. on a travel visa after they married. Applicant \nhad a green card at the time. His wife was required to return to Jordan after her visa \nexpired. He applied for a spouse visa, which she received. From 2004 to 2005, she \nlived for approximately one year in the U.S. and six months in Jordan. She last visited \nthe U.S. in July 2009, for two months. Applicant resided in Jordan with his wife from \nAugust 2007 to January 2008. He has traveled to Jordan two or three times since \nJanuary 2008. One trip was for about a month. One trip was for 11 days. He expects his \nwife will move to the U.S. when his children finish school in June 2010.2 \n \n \nApplicant renewed his Jordanian passport on January 16, 2008. It was to expire \non January 15, 2013. He retained his Jordanian passport after he became a U.S. \ncitizen. He used this passport on September 12, 2009, to travel to Lebanon to attend his \nfriend\u2019s wedding. He was advised by his friend that if he used his U.S. passport he \nwould be delayed at the Syrian border. He stated \u201cI ha[d] no choice but to use the \nJordanian Passport to be safe and for the last time.\u201d3 On September 23, 2009, \nApplicant surrendered his Jordanian passport to his facility security officer and it was \n \n1 Tr. 20-26, 28-31, 78-81. \n \n2 Tr. 63-68, 73-79. \n \n3 AE E.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nssport.   \n                                                          \ndestroyed. The certification letter stated that Applicant \u201crenounced his Jordanian \ncitizenship by surrendering his Jordanian passport.\u201d4 In interrogatories dated February \n28, 2009, he stated he was unwilling to renounce his Jordanian citizenship. He has not \ntaken any other affirmative action to renounce his Jordanian citizenship. At his hearing \nApplicant explained that by destroying his passport, it would require a long procedure to \nget a new one. He does not intend to renew his Jordanian pa\n5\n \n \nApplicant attended college and studied law, which was a four-year program. He \nthen was a legal apprentice for two years and passed the Jordanian bar exam in \nJanuary 1999. He paid his bar dues a couple of times, but no longer pays them. One \nmust be a Jordanian citizen to practice law in Jordan. Applicant stated he would give up \nhis Jordanian citizenship even if it meant he could not practice law there.6  \n \nApplicant purchased an apartment in Jordan in 2003 for investment purposes. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and two children live in the apartment. It is completely paid for and is \nworth approximately $45,000. He does not own any other real property in Jordan. He \nretained his Jordanian passport until recently, so he could give his wife a power of \nattorney to sell his property. He does not own any real property in the U.S.7  \n \n \nTwo weeks before his hearing Applicant closed a bank account he maintained in \nJordan.8 He owned stocks in Jordan and sold them in the past year. He stated he has \nno other financial interests in Jordan. Applicant did not serve in the Jordanian military.9  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife does not work outside of the home. He sends her money through \na shared account in the U.S. that she can access. His wife has a medical issue. She \nlives in Jordan because he can afford to pay a maid to help take care of the house. He \nexplained that he sent his wife to Jordan while the children were small so she could \nhave help. He would not be able to afford domestic help if she lived in the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s children attend a bilingual Christian school.10  \n \n \n \nApplicant lives with his parents who are dual citizens of Jordan and the U.S. His \nfather was in the Jordanian army for 22 years and then worked in Saudi Arabia. He \nreceives a pension from Jordan. His father owns an old house and parcel of land in \n \n4 AE A. \n \n5 Tr. 68-73. \n \n6 Tr. 59-62. \n \n7 Tr. 26-27, 62, 76. \n \n8 Tr. 27-28; AE B. \n \n9 Tr. 38. \n \n10 Tr. 31-36. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nJordan that he inherited from his father. Applicant\u2019s uncle maintains the property. His \nparents return to Jordan every two years for a visit.11  \n \nApplicant has four brothers. One brother also lives with Applicant\u2019s parents. He \nhas a disability. He is a dual citizen of Jordan and the U.S.12  \n \nApplicant\u2019s second brother is a dual citizen of Jordan and the U.S. He resides in \nthe U.S. and manages his parent\u2019s store. His wife is a dual citizen of Jordan and the \nU.S. He has four children who are all dual citizens of Jordan and the U.S.13  \n \nA third brother lives in Jordan where he owns a business. He is a dual citizen of \nthe U.S. and Jordan. His wife is a dual citizen of Jordan and the U.S. They have five \nchildren, four of whom were born in the U.S. and the youngest was born in Jordan. His \ndaughter, who is over 18 years old, was born in the U.S. and attends school here.14  \n \nA fourth brother is a dual citizen of Jordan and the U.S. He resides in the U.S. He \nhad a Jordanian passport, but did not renew it. He does not visit Jordan. His wife is a \nJordanian citizen and holds a U.S. green card. She is not yet eligible to apply for U.S. \ncitizenship. He has two children; one was born in Jordan, the other in the U.S. Both are \ndual citizens. Applicant and his brother served as linguist recruiters, whose job is to find \nqualified linguists who can support the U.S. Army. The brother has worked as a linguist \nrecruiter for the U.S. Army for two years. He only works in the U.S. and not overseas. \nApplicant explained that his family has maintained their dual citizenship status so they \ncan travel to Jordan.15 \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens of Jordan and live in the U.S. Both \nparents-in-law are sick and do not work. They came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and \nin 2000 decided to remain. His wife has six siblings. One brother is a retired police \nofficer who receives a pension from the Jordanian government. He is a citizen of Jordan \nand resides with his family in Oman. Another brother is a citizen of Jordan and resides \nthere with his family. He is a store owner and has a U.S. green card. Two sisters and a \nbrother live in the U.S. and the remaining brother lives in Canada. One brother holds a \ngreen card. Applicant was unaware of the citizenship status of the others.16   \n \n \n11 Tr.55-59. \n \n12 Tr. 45-46. \n \n13 Tr. 43-45. \n \n14 Tr. 52-55. \n \n15 Tr. 46-52. \n \n16 Tr. 36-43, 97. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nWhen he lived in Jordan, Applicant was persecuted because he was not Muslim. \nHe also suffered discrimination while attending law school and he was pressured to \nconvert to Islam.17  \n \n \nAfter he became a U.S. citizen, Applicant participated in the U.S. presidential \nelection. He participated in the Jordanian elections in 2005 because a distant cousin \nwas running for a seat in Parliament. She did not win.18  \n \n \nApplicant has a U.S. bank account. He attended a U.S. university and has \nearned nine credits towards a master\u2019s degree.19  \n \n \nApplicant provided a character letter from a military supervisor. The supervisor \nstated he had a lengthy professional relationship with Applicant and believes he \npossesses the concrete professional attributes and unique personal characteristic that \nwill assist him in his career. He further stated Applicant had an impeccable record. He is \ntechnically and tactically proficient in his work. He has numerous accomplishments and \nperforms well in a demanding environment. He believes Applicant expresses a solid \ncommitment toward the nation, the U.S. Army, and his family.20 \n \nJordan21 \n \nJordan\u2019s government is a constitutional monarchy. It is ruled by a King and has a \nCouncil of Ministers selected by the King and has a partially elected bicameral National \nAssembly. It has followed a pro-western foreign policy and has had close ties with the \nU.S. for decades.  \n \nJordan\u2019s human rights record continues to reflect problems. Issues include \ntorture, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention, denial of due process, infringement of \nprivacy rights, political detainees, and restrictions on freedom of speech, press, \nassembly, association, and movement. Torture by the police and security forces is \nwidespread.  \n \nJordanian law allows any male relative to prevent a woman or child from leaving \nJordan, even if they are U.S. citizens. Dual citizens are subject to certain obligations, \nincluding mandatory military service for males less than 37 years. Jordan treats dual \ncitizens as Jordanian citizens under the law and it may not inform the U.S. embassy if a \ndual Jordanian-American citizen experiences problems while in Jordan.  \n \n \n17 Tr. 62, 95. \n \n18 Tr. 82-84. \n \n19 Tr. 88-89. \n \n20 AE D. \n \n21 HE I-IV, GE 4. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe threat of terrorism in Jordan is high and westerners are specifically targeted. \nAl-Qaida focuses terrorist activities against both the U.S. and Jordan. Specifically, Al-\nQaida claimed responsibility for the bombings of three hotels in Jordan, a rocket attack \ntargeting a U.S. naval ship, and the assassination of an American diplomat. Jordan\u2019s \nState Security Court convicted and sentenced three individuals, first to death, but then \ncommuted the sentences to 15 years each, for plotting to assassinate President George \nW. Bush, during his November 2006 trip to Jordan. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the security concern involving foreign preference: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following:  \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport . . . (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or \nbusiness interests in another country; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen.  \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Jordan and the U.S. He used his Jordanian passport \nto travel to Lebanon after becoming a U.S. citizen. He kept his passport so he could \nprovide his wife with a power of attorney in Jordan to sell property. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply.  \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11:  \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; and  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nApplicant\u2019s exercised dual citizenship after he became a U.S. citizen and used \nhis Jordanian passport. He has tangentially expressed a willingness to renounce his \ndual citizenship, however without some official documentation he could still be subject \nto Jordanian laws while in that country. Applicant surrendered his Jordanian passport \nand it was destroyed by his facilities security officer. I find mitigating conditions (a), and \n(c) do not apply. I find mitigating condition (b) and (e) apply.  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(c) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened  risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident of Jordan. She lives there with \nApplicant\u2019s two children. Applicant travels to Jordan to visit his family. His parents and \nsiblings are all dual citizens of Jordan and the U.S. One brother resides in Jordan. Many \nof his wife\u2019s family reside in the U.S. or Canada, but remain citizens of Jordan. Some of \nher relatives remain in Jordan. Applicant owns property in Jordan. His father also owns \nproperty there. Applicant\u2019s ties to Jordan are significant because his wife and children \nlive there. Applicant shares living quarters with his wife when he is in Jordan, and he \nprovides support for his family.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Jordan and his \nchildren are dual citizens. Because he has not formally renounced his Jordanian \ncitizenship, when he travels to Jordan he could be subject to Jordanian laws. His \nrelationship with his wife and his children create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation. Although Jordan and the U.S. have ties, there are many factions \nin the country that create a heightened risk. Applicant\u2019s connection with his wife and \nchildren also creates a conflict of interests because the relationship is sufficiently close \nto raise a security concern. Applicant has a brother and his family living in Jordan. \nTherefore, I find disqualifying conditions (a), (b) and (c) apply to Applicant\u2019s wife, \nchildren, and brother. I do not find the disqualifying conditions apply to his other \nrelatives because they all live in the U.S. Applicant owns property in Jordan. He is \nattempting to sell it, but at present he maintains a significant financial interest in Jordan \nand disqualifying condition (e) applies.  \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests;  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual \n \nApplicant travels to Jordan to visit his family. He maintains close ties with them. \nHe maintains a financial interest in Jordan. Applicant has not met his burden of \nestablishing that it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of his wife and children living in Jordan and the interests of the U.S. His \ncontacts with them could potentially force him to choose between the two.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. Jordan has maintained ties with the U.S. for \ndecades. However, there are active terrorist organizations within Jordan that target \nwesterners. The government also has a questionable human rights record. Applicant \nhas a very heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that his wife and children in \nJordan do not pose a security risk, and he is not in a position to be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the U.S. and his family members. Applicant has not met that burden. \nI find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family lives in Jordan. His wife is a citizen of Jordan and \nhis children are dual citizens. He applied for dual citizenship for his son so he would not \nhave to pay a tax. When visiting Jordan, Applicant is subject to their laws, because he \nhas not formally renounced his citizenship with the Jordanian government. Although he \nrecently surrendered his Jordanian passport, it does not negate his present and past \ncontacts and actions regarding Jordan. I find under the circumstances there could be a \nconflict of interest and mitigating condition (b) does not apply.  \n \nSecurity concerns are reduced where contact and correspondence with foreign \ncitizens are casual and infrequent because the risk of foreign exploitation or pressure is \nless. Applicant maintains regular contact with his family in Jordan. He has less contact \nwith his brother. These contacts are not casual and infrequent. I find mitigating condition \n(c) does not apply. \n \nApplicant closed a bank account he had in Jordan and sold his stocks there. He \nowns an apartment in Jordan where his wife and children live. He does not own \nproperty in the U.S. It appears that the property in Jordan is Applicant\u2019s main asset and \nit could be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure him because it is the domicile for \nhis family. I find mitigating condition (f) does not apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has served the U.S. as a \nlinguist recruiter. He expresses his loyalty to the U.S. Most of his family are dual citizens \nof the U.S. and Jordan and live in the U.S. He cherishes the freedoms he has been \nafforded in the U.S. His wife is a permanent resident of the U.S., but lives in Jordan with \ntheir two children. He owns the apartment where they live. His close family ties in \nJordan create a security concern. I find he has mitigated the foreign preference security \nconcerns, but failed to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interests to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s financial considerations security\nconcern. Clearance is denied.\nOn February 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2009, admitting the allegations and\nrequesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009. On June 3, 2009,\na Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the case for June 22, 2009. The hearing was\nAugust 17, 2009\n\nSOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b are duplicates (Tr. 21).\n1\n2\nconducted as scheduled. I received three government exhibits, seven Applicant\nexhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open at the\nend of the hearing for her to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, she\nsubmitted another exhibit which I marked and received as Exhibit H. The transcript was\nreceived on June 29, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 55-year-old single woman with one adult daughter. She served in\nthe U.S. Army Reserves from 1974 to 1975, and on active duty from 1975 to 1977. She\nwas honorably discharged.\nSince the late 1970s, Applicant has worked for various employers for various\nintervals as a designer  of electrical components on submarines. She has also worked\nbriefly as a pipefitter during this period. In approximately 2000, Applicant enrolled in\ncollege, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management in 2004.\nApplicant is well respected on the job. According to her current supervisor, \u201cher\nconduct has been very professional and she exhibits credibility and integrity in her\ndealings with others\u201d (Exhibit F). According to a previous supervisor, she \u201chas the ability\nto learn fast and on the fly\u201d (Exhibit E). \nApplicant has six delinquent debts totalling approximately $30,000, including two\npersonal loans (SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.e) , two credit cards (SOR\n1\nsubparagraphs 1.c and f), a medical bill (SOR subparagraph 1.d), and a student loan\n(SOR subparagraph 1.g). Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2002 when she was\nfired from a job through no fault of her own (Tr. 41). She then began working two part-\ntime jobs. In 2004, her mother suffered a severe, debilitating heart attack (Tr. 41).\nApplicant quit her job to care for her. For the next three years, she was her mother\u2019s\nprimary caregiver before returning to work in September 2007.\nApplicant received the loan listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a in 1999. It was\noriginally in the amount of $8,000 (Tr. 44). She made steady payments through 2002\nwhen she was laid off (Tr. 45). She then made smaller payment between 2003 and\n2004. When she stopped working entirely after she quit her part-time jobs to care for her\nmother, she contacted the creditor to attempt to reduce her payments further (Tr. 20).\nThe creditor rejected her request, and she stopped making payments (Tr. 20).\nCurrently, Applicant is disputing the amount due. She provided no evidence in support\nof her dispute, nor any evidence supporting her contention that she had been making\npayments through 2004. \nSOR subparagraph 1.c remains outstanding. Applicant cannot remember\nwhether or not she has contacted the creditor (Tr. 43). SOR subparagraph 1.d is a bill\n\n3\nfor a mammogram Applicant received in 2004. At the time, she had no health insurance.\nShe owes $811. As of the hearing, she had not contacted the creditor (Tr. 43). \nApplicant applied for, and received the loan listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e in\n1999 to pay for income taxes (Tr. 44-46). She made payments steadily through 2002\nwhen she lost her job. She made reduced payments through 2003, until she had to quit\nthe part-time jobs to care for her mother (Tr. 46). Since then, she has neither made\npayments, nor contacted the creditor (Id.). Approximately, $15,400 remains outstanding.\nSOR subparagraph 1.f is a credit card Applicant opened in 1999 to pay for\nclothing (Tr. 47). It grew delinquent after she was laid off (Exhibit 3 at 15). It remains\noutstanding, and the approximate balance due is $1,930.\nApplicant has been making steady, monthly payments toward the satisfaction of\nSOR subparagraph 1.g, the student loan (Exhibit G). The current balance is $2,975. It is\nno longer in delinquent status (cf. Exhibit 3 at 18 with Exhibit G). \nCurrently, Applicant earns approximately $53,300 per year. Her salary increased\nby approximately $9,600 since January 2009 (Tr. 67). She maintains a budget (Tr. 70).\nShe has approximately $2,200 in savings accounts, and $482 in monthly after-expense\nincome (Tr. 70-76). Although she is no longer her mother\u2019s primary caretaker, she uses\nnearly all of her after-expense income to help care for her mother.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n4\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when she lost her job in 2002. She\nattempted to mitigate the income loss by working two part-time jobs. Also, she\ncontinued to pay her creditors, albeit in reduced amounts. She did not completely lose\ncontrol of her finances until her mother became disabled, compelling her to quit her jobs\nto care for her. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies.\nOther than keeping current on student loan payments, Applicant has done little to\nsatisfy her outstanding debts since regaining full-time employment in 2007. As for the\ndebts she contends she is either satisfying or attempting to settle, she provided minimal\nsupporting evidence. All, except SOR subparagraph 1.g, the student loan, remain\ndelinquent. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201c. . . there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved, or is under control,\u201d nor AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n5\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by financial extravagance or\nirresponsible spending. Instead, they occurred after a layoff, and a subsequent disability\nof her mother that compelled Applicant to quit her part-time jobs to care for her.\nApplicant, however, has failed to take any significant steps to address her\ndelinquencies. Consequently, it is too soon to conclude that her financial delinquencies\nno longer pose a security concern. Upon evaluating this case in the context of the whole\nperson concept, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations\nsecurity concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nIn a March 25, 2010, response, Applicant admitted two allegations and, in part,\nadmitted a third allegation of the eight allegations raised in the SOR under Guideline E.\nHe did not address the allegations raised under Guideline J and I considered them\ndenied. Applicant requested a hearing on the matter. DOHA assigned the case to me\non July 14, 2010. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a hearing date of\nAugust 26, 2010. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on August 5, 2010. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony, offered one witness,\nand presented four documents, which were accepted as exhibits (Exs.) A-D without\nobjection.

On September 7, 2010, Department Counsel\nforwarded to me eight additional documents from Applicant. In the absence of any\nobjection to the materials, I accepted them into the record as Exs. E-L.

When she saw the\nmug shot of the individual designated as being her son, she realized it was the same\nacquaintance with whom Applicant had gone to a nightclub with in April 2001.  It was\n3\n\n Ex.

Applicant did not know all the participants. He got involved in the fracas.\n5\nApplicant, now 20 years old, was knocked out. He was kicked repeatedly in the face,\nbreaking his jaw. He was found unconscious and taken to the hospital.  At the hospital,\n6\nApplicant\u2019s injuries were addressed and his jaw was wired shut so it could heal.  His\n7\nsister and parents took him home from the hospital on April 8, 2003. An April 15, 2003,\nuniversity police report states that Applicant threatened one of the fight participants at\nan April 10, 2003, party by repeatedly stating he was going to kill him.  The report does\n8\nnot reconcile how Applicant, with a jaw wired shut, conveyed a serious threat, but it\ndoes note that the incident occurred off-campus and that the April 15, 2003, report was\nnot contemporaneous.  Applicant has consistently denied the attributed threat. He\n9\nnotes that he was recuperating at the time, was unable to speak, and did not attend a\nparty on April 10, 2003.  The report notes that Applicant was the victim in its\n10\ninvestigation. It also notes that Applicant declined to prosecute or go to trial over the\nmatter, thus ending the investigation.\nA year later, on the evening of April 7, 2004, Applicant and an acquaintance\nwere in Applicant\u2019s car. Applicant received a call from a fellow student asking him if he\nwould like to participate in a \u201crobbery of a guy who has some marijuana.\u201d  Applicant\n11\ndeclined to be involved.

Applicant then went home.14\nThe caller had set up the crime. The robbers approached the target\u2019s apartment door\nand knocked. When the target answered, they entered the apartment, robbed the\noccupants, and the drug dealer was shot in the process. A houseguest of the victim was\nalso shot. Later, Applicant was informed of what had happened. The acquaintance\nimplicated Applicant in the crimes, which ultimately included the drug dealer\u2019s murder.\nApplicant was arrested and held for a year.  \n15\nUltimately, in mid-2005, the acquaintance and others pled guilty to various\ncrimes. Pending trials for those charged in the incident, Applicant was charged with\nAttempted Robbery, Murder, Break and Enter, Maiming, and four counts of Use of a\nFirearm. Applicant\u2019s counsel convinced Applicant to accept a plea agreement, which he\ndid. Applicant was convicted of Attempted Robbery, a felony, and sentenced to 10\nyears incarceration (nine years suspended), 12 months of probation, and payment of\ncourt costs. He was then released from incarceration after his plea, with his one year in\nprison pending trial counted as time served toward his adjudged jail time.  The\n16\nremaining charges were nolle prosequi. The 22-year-old Applicant then completed his\n12 months of supervised probation on May 9, 2006.  As a result of his involvement in\n17\nthe crime, Applicant was expelled from college. On reflection, he deeply regrets his\ninvolvement in the crime.18\nIn May 25, 2007, while he was employed as a consultant with a real estate entity,\nApplicant saw a man on a street corner who asked him if he could have a ride.\nApplicant asked if the man had any gas money. The man revealed himself as a police\nofficer conducting a sting operation concerning illegal hackers. Applicant was charged\nand found guilty of Solicit Offer to Transport a Passenger and fined $57.50.19\nOn May 29, 2008, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In\nresponse to Question 23 (Your Police Record - In the last seven years, have you been\narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed above?), Applicant\nnoted his Attempted Robbery conviction and other incidents. He did not disclose\ninformation concerning the 2002 Motor Vehicle/Unlawful Taking and Livestock/Motor\nVehicle charges or the 2007 Solicit Offer to Transport a Passenger conviction.\nApplicant explained that he did not list the 2002 incident because, to the best of his\n\n Tr. 61.\n      20\n Tr. 62.\n      21\n Tr. 62-63.

He is\n23\ncommitted to avoiding criminal and compromising situations in the future. Since his\nrelease from prison in 2005, Applicant has turned his life around. He is candid about his\npast, including his incarceration. He has matured and maintained continuous\nemployment in a variety of positions. He received instruction in real estate before trying\na career as a broker.  He has enjoyed the stability of his current custodial position for\n24\nthree years.

She\n31\narticulated well his appreciation of his current job and its importance to him.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n32\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n33\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\n\n Id.\n      34\n Id.\n      35\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      36\n Id.\n      37\n Although instances of alleged criminal conduct is better examined and fully considered under Guideline\n      38\nJ, below, it is equally considered under Guideline E.\n7\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n34\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.35\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the most pertinent to this case. Conditions\npertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and\ndiscussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n36\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  Here,\n37\npersonal conduct security concerns arose because Applicant failed to disclose his 2002\ncharges for Motor Vehicle/Unlawful Taking and Livestock/Motor Vehicle and the 2007\nincident involving the Solicit Offer to Transport a Passenger on his SCA. In addition,\noverall security concerns arose because of personal conduct issues related to seven\nalleged instances of criminal conduct and social misconduct between 2001 and 2007.  \n38\nRegarding the SCA-related issues, if his omissions were intentional, the\nomissions would be sufficient to raise Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6\n16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities).\nIn completing his SCA, Applicant duly noted his past criminal conduct, including\nthe information leading to his attempted robbery conviction. He did not mention the\n\n If a disqualifying condition were applicable, mitigating conditions \u00b6\u00b6 AG 17(f) and 17(b) would apply,\n      39\nrespectively.\n8\nmotor/vehicle/unlawful taking and livestock/motor vehicle incident noted in SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.c because he did not commit the violation, he was shown not to have\ncommitted the violation, and he assumed it had been administratively corrected.\nApplicant made an honest mistake, and his failure to list this charge was not deliberate\nor with intent to deceive the Government. As for the 2007 solicit offer to transport\nmisdemeanor noted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.g, Applicant was told by his security officer\nnot to list the incident. As Applicant logically surmised, it would make no sense to\nconceal a hacking violation while disclosing an attempted murder charge. I find that\nApplicant\u2019s omission of these two incidents was not occasioned by an intent to falsify or\nconceal. Consequently, no disqualifying condition applies.39\nAs for the remaining allegations under Guideline E, personal conduct\ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative\nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information), AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information), and \u00b6 16(g) (association with persons involved in\ncriminal activity) apply. \nWith regard to the motor/vehicle/unlawful taking and livestock/motor vehicle\nincident noted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c because he did not commit the violation, he was\nshown not to be the individual who committed the violation, and he assumed it had\nbeen administratively corrected. These facts raise AG \u00b6 17(f) (the information was\nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability). The solicit offer of\ntransport violation noted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.g is an infraction for a relatively arcane\nmisdemeanor. Applicant was unaware that asking for gas money in return for a ride was\nnot permitted in his city. There is no evidence he meant to breach local rules, and the\nconduct demonstrated is aberrant when compared to the prior examples of alleged\ncriminal activity and misconduct. There is no likelihood such conduct will recur. I find\nthat AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) applies.  \nApplicant was a teen when he was charged with firearms citations (SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.a). Those charges were ultimately dismissed, with the evidence indicating\nthat the gun in question was not his. Such unique circumstances are sufficient to raise\nAG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\n\n In addition, regarding SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c, sufficient evidence exists to suggest that AG \u00b6 17(f) also\n      40\napplies.\n9\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) and AG \u00b6 17(f) (the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of\nquestionable reliability). Moreover, since Applicant served his 2005 sentence, he has\neschewed the company of those involved in criminal and questionable behavior, raising\nAG \u00b6 17(g) (association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs\nunder circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations).\nApplicant was an underclassmen when he was cited for disruptive behavior in\nthe classroom in 2002, as described in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b, and reported as having\nverbally threatened the life of another student at a party in 2003, as noted in SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.d.  Applicant\u2019s description of the former incident is credible, and it is\nnotable that no administrative or academic action was taken as a result of his alleged\nclassroom disturbance. As for the latter incident, the report accurately notes that\nApplicant\u2019s mouth/jaw was wired shut at he time. The report, however, notes that the\ninformation gathered was solicited days after the alleged incident, a party at which\nApplicant denies he attended. His version of the facts, the report\u2019s indefinite findings,\nand an absence of legal or administrative repercussions for the alleged threat, make\nthis allegation suspect, particularly given the fact error was obviously present in the\nsituation noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c. Given, Applicant\u2019s age at the times concerned,\nthe unique situations presented, and the age of the allegations, Personal Conduct\nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed,\nor the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.40\nRemaining is the incident that led to Applicant\u2019s conviction for Attempted\nRobbery, a felony, and his resultant expulsion from college (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and\n1.f). While the rest of the allegations are unsubstantiated or depict incidents of youthful\ninjudiciousness, the facts and circumstances prefacing the April 2004 robbery and\neventual murder are atypically egregious. When Applicant declined to participate in the\nrobbery, he demonstrated some judgment. Rather than hang up the phone, however,\nhe gave the receiver to an acquaintance who willingly accepted a role in the crime.\nGood judgment would have had Applicant walk away. Instead, Applicant drove his\nacquaintance to a designated spot near the targeted apartment, dropped his passenger\nto assist in a contemplated robbery, and went home. While Applicant had no idea that\nthe evening would end in gunshots and murder, he knew a robbery was planned\nagainst a known drug dealer. His involvement, limited as it was, demonstrated\nconsiderably poor judgment and merited a conviction for attempted robbery because he\naided in the commission of the offenses. To the extent that Applicant has been candid\nabout his 2005 Attempted Robbery conviction and the 2004 events leading up to his\nplea, as well as his full disclosure of the events on his SCA , AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual\nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress) applies. \n\n10\nRemaining as potentially applicable is AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). In early 2004, Applicant was\ncharged with multiple counts, including Murder. After consideration of the facts and a\nplea bargain, he was convicted of Attempted Robbery for his limited participation in the\nshooting. In the interim, Applicant was taken into custody and expelled from school. In\nMay 2005, his plea was entered, sentence imposed, and he was released from prison\nbased on the one year served. He completed his probation on May 6, 2006. Aside from\nthe 2001 firearm charge, which was dismissed when it was determined the gun in his\ncar was not his, it is his only substantiated charge regarding violence and his only\nconviction.\nSince the 2004 incident, Applicant has completed his sentence and his\nprobation. He was also fined a nominal sum for asking a passenger for gas money. He\nhas been continuously employed, pursued real estate studies, tried to return to college,\nand volunteered his time to help foster children avoid facing a similar fate. Applicant\nhas excelled in his current work as a .custodial worker. At work, he is described as\nprofessional, respectful, and dedicated. He now associates with professionals, peers,\nand family members, all of whom speak highly of his diligence and personality. At the\nhearing, he was a credible and communicative witness who took responsibility, and\nexpressed contrition, for his part in the 2004 crime. At that time, Applicant was barely\n21 years old. Today, he is 27 years old. \n Moreover, in the six-and-a-half years since he drove an acquaintance to a\ndesignated venue to engage in a serious felony, Applicant has demonstrably changed.\nHe has matured considerably over the years, through natural maturation and raw\nexperience. Rather than become embittered following his incarceration, Applicant has\nemerged a pleasant and earnest man who genuinely wants to put his past behind him,\nmove on, and avoid both questionable activities and associates. Without dismissing the\ngravity of the crime committed, sufficient time has passed since that singular, grievous\ncrime was committed, I find that the foregoing and Applicant\u2019s demonstrated maturation\ngive rise to  AG \u00b6 17(c)  (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment). As well, AG \u00b6 17(g) (association with persons involved in criminal\nactivity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations) also applies.\nApplicant paid his dues to society for his part in the 2004 scheme that ultimately\nresulted in a murder. The lack of judgment displayed in 2004 was extreme, but\nApplicant has effectively turned his life around, matured, and now demonstrates sound\njudgment. Other than a 2007 fine for soliciting gas money in exchange for a ride in his\nvehicle, he has led an incident-free life, been gainfully employed, and volunteers in his\ncommunity. This process is concerned with an applicant\u2019s security worthiness; it is not\ndesigned to disregard personal improvement marked by reliability and trustworthiness\n\n AG \u00b6 30.\n      41\n11\nor serve a blindly punitive purpose. In light of the foregoing, I find that Applicant has\nmitigated personal conduct security concerns.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nThe concern under this guideline is that \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d41\nIn raising this guideline, the SOR simply redirects attention to four allegations previously\naddressed, specifically, SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, the dismissed 2001 handgun incident; \u00b6\n1.c, the inaccurately reported August 2002 charges for Motor Vehicle/Unlawful Taking\nand Livestock/Motor Vehicle; \u00b6 1.f, the 2004 crime leading to Applicant\u2019s 2005\nconviction for Attempted Robbery; and \u00b6 1.g, the 2007 Solicit Offer to Transport\nPassenger. Such incidents are sufficient to raise Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6\n31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Consequently, it is Applicant\u2019s\nburden to mitigate the security concerns raised.\nAs previously noted, the 2001 handgun possession charge was dismissed\nbecause the gun at issue was not Applicant\u2019s. Given the fact presented, Criminal\nConduct Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the\noffense) applies.\nThe court documents related to the August 2002 charges for Motor\nVehicle/Unlawful Taking and Livestock/Motor Vehicle reveal that the individual noted\nwith an alias that was the same as Applicant\u2019s name, but taller and with a different birth\ndate, was the true culprit in a crime of which Applicant had no knowledge. AG \u00b6 32(c)\n(evidence that the person did not commit the offense) applies.\nIn light of the nature of the 2007 Solicit Offer to Transport Passenger charge,\nApplicant\u2019s conviction, his nominal fine, and no evidence the incident was the result of\nan ill advised attempt to start an illegal hacking career,  AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. This offense is unlikely to recur\nand does not reflect adversely on Applicant\u2019s current judgment.\nI have again considered the facts and circumstances surrounding the crime that\nultimately led to Applicant\u2019s Attempted Robbery conviction and incorporate my findings\nabove herein. Moreover, I again have considered the extreme nature of the\noccurrences of that night, the extent of Applicant\u2019s participation, Applicant\u2019s highly\ncredible contrition for his participation in that crime, his subsequent good behavior, the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal conduct, good work performance,\ncommunity service, and his attempts to further his education. \n\n12\nApplicant\u2019s 2007 conviction was for a minor, technical violation; his significant\ncriminal contribution in 2004 occurred over six-and-a-half years ago. Now 27, he has\nmatured considerably in the intervening years. He has completely changed his life and\nhis lifestyle. He is devoted to his job. He values the opportunity to prove his self-worth\nand diligence. There is no evidence he continues to associate with, or emulate,\nindividuals who disregard the law. Rather, he articulated and demonstrated his\ncommitment to staying clear of incidents manifesting criminal and personal conduct\nissues. For those reasons and those previously noted, I find  AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time\nhas elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32 (d) (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor, he is 27 years old and has been successfully\nemployed as a custodial worker for nearly three years. At work, he is a valued and\neffective employee. He has served his sentence for his limited participation in a\ngrievous crime in 2004, which occurred shortly after he turned 21.  He is contrite over\nhis past criminal involvement and very poor judgment, both in 2004 and for earlier\nincidents while in school. He was unaware that asking for gas money in exchange for a\ncar ride was proscribed. Applicant is earnestly focusing on his custodial work, building\nhis future, contributing positively to his community, and completing his college\neducation. Applicant sincerely wants to continue his efforts to prove his self-worth at\nwork and with peers. He is backed by a supportive family and his employer. He was a\nhighly credible witness and his equally credible sister was exceptionally passionate in\nher support of the more mature man he is today. Applicant is committed to staying\naway from criminal activity and leading an honest life.\nMuch of Applicant\u2019s earlier incidents of issue were the result of immaturity, poor\nselection of associates, or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The 2004\ncriminal offense is the most striking. Although it is not recent, it is a singular instance of\ndeliberate malfeasance. Applicant declined to participate in the planned robbery of a\ndrug dealer. Before going home, however, he voluntarily drove an associate to a\nmeeting place so his acquaintance could join in the planned criminal activity.\nConsequently, the 21-year-old Applicant helped bring the planned crime together. For\n\n13\nthat decision, Applicant spent a year in jail pending trial, stood trial, was released, and\ncompleted his probation without incident. Rather than become embittered, Applicant\nhas struggled to live an industrious and crime-free life. Since that time, his only adverse\nincident was a citation for soliciting gas money for giving someone a ride in his car. He\nhas held steady work as a custodian for three years, where he is regarded as a hard\nworker. He volunteers with foster children by encouraging them to take responsibility for\ntheir actions and to stay \u201con the right track.\u201d He is attempting to complete his college\neducation. He has been candid about his attempted robbery conviction, which he fully\ndetailed on his security clearance application, and credibly testified his commitment to\nliving with the law. There is no indication that further criminal incidents will occur in the\nfuture. He is committed to excelling at work and doing nothing that might jeopardize his\nemployment. In light of the foregoing, I find that Applicant has mitigated personal\nconduct and criminal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1h:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nARTHUR E.

In response to questions about his finances,\nApplicant disclosed that he owed a significant amount of delinquent debt. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a set of\ninterrogatories  to obtain clarification of, and/or additional information about, potentially\n1\ndisqualifying information in his background. Based on the results of the background\ninvestigation, including Applicant\u2019s response to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators\nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines take precedence over the guidelines listed\nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to allow him access to classified information. On April 28, 2009,\nDOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if\nestablished, raise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines3\nunder Guideline F (financial considerations).\nOn June 3, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on July 24, 2009, and I convened a hearing on August 26,\n2009. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits,\nwhich were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 4. Applicant\ntestified and presented one exhibit, which was admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit (Ax.) A. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on September 4, 2009. I\nleft the record open after the hearing (Tr. 52 - 53) to give Applicant time to submit\nadditional relevant information. On September 10, 2009, I received Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission. It has been admitted into the record without objection as Ax. B.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged that Applicant owes approximately\n$39,608 for 14 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.n) that, as of March 26, 2009,\nremained unpaid. Applicant admitted without explanation all but one (he denied SOR \u00b6\n1.e) of these allegations. In addition to the facts established through his admissions, I\nhave made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 50 years old and is seeking a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment with a defense contractor as a facilities technician, a position he has\nheld since May 2008. Applicant held a similar job, albeit not with a defense contractor,\nfrom October 1998 until November 2005, when he lost his job when the plant where he\nworked closed. He was subsequently unemployed until July 2006, when he found work\nas a site manager for an architectural firm. However, that job paid about 20% less than\nbefore. Applicant was laid off again in August 2007, and he was unemployed until he\nobtained his current position. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant has been married twice. His first marriage was brief (August 1978 -\nMarch 1979) and ended in divorce. He re-married in April 1982. He and his second wife\nhad one child, now age 24, but divorced in August 2004. In late 2005, he and his ex-\nwife reconciled but did not remarry. Unfortunately, she died of colon cancer in February\n2008. When they divorced in 2004, Applicant was left with most of the marital debts;\nhowever, his subsequent job loss in 2005 made it difficult to for him to keep up with\nregular monthly obligations, such as rent, utilities, and car payments, much less pay off\ncredit cards and other discretionary obligations. His ex-wife worked for the same\n\n3\ncompany and also lost her job in 2005, so she could not help pay their debts either. (Tr.\n24 - 27)\nWhen Applicant obtained his current job, he drove a Ford pickup truck. He lives\nabout 75 miles from his work site, so he was required to drive about 150 miles round trip\nfive days a week. At the time, high gas prices, together with a $400 monthly car loan\npayment and insurance meant that he was paying about $1,000 each month to get back\nand forth to work. Around October 2008, he decided to let his truck be voluntarily\nrepossessed. In its place he bought a used car that gets better gas mileage and costs\nless to insure. The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.I ($7,280) represents his remaining debt\nafter the truck was resold. (Tr. 27 - 28)\nApplicant owes four delinquent medical bills totaling about $2,125. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\n1.d) He incurred those bills while he was unemployed and did not have any medical\ninsurance. The actual total of the services was about $10,000. He has been making\npayments on two of those debts. (Tr. 35 - 36; Ax. B) Additionally, some of the debts\nalleged in the SOR are duplicates. SOR \u00b6 1.l ($4,732) is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.e\n($4,733). Both are collection agencies for the same credit card company, with whom\nApplicant had only one account. (Tr. 9, 37 - 38) SOR \u00b6 1.n ($5,120) is a duplicate of\nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($2,332). The former creditor is a collection agency for the latter creditor, who\nwas the original party in interest. The higher amount of the SOR \u00b6 1.n debt is for\npenalties and interest added on by the collection agency.\nThe debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.f ($3,341) is the remaining amount from the purchase\nof a television Applicant financed before he was laid off in 2005. He made about $1,000\nin monthly payments as required for about a year before the account became\ndelinquent. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleged a $187 debt for an unpaid phone bill Applicant did not\nknow was delinquent until he received the DOHA interrogatories in March 2009. He has\nsince settled this debt for $98. (Tr. 39)\nThe debt at SOR \u00b6 1.h is for the loan Applicant obtained in 2004 to buy a\nmotorcycle. As of the hearing, he was about six months behind on the $250 monthly\npayment required. He has been trying without success to sell the bike since about\nSeptember 2008. At that time, Applicant, who had been living with a roommate, moved\ninto his own place, but he was unable to find accommodations he could afford and pay\nthe motorcycle loan payment. Applicant acknowledged the probability the motorcycle\nwill be repossessed. (Tr. 34, 40 - 42)\nThe debt at SOR \u00b6 1.k ($5,998) is for a credit card account Applicant admitted is\naccurately alleged. He relied on that card when he became unemployed. The debt at\nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($89), which has been paid, was for a cable television account that went\nunpaid when Applicant moved in August 2006. Applicant was unaware the account had\nnot been paid until he received the DOHA interrogatories. (Gx. 3; Tr. 45)\nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in March 2009, he submitted\na personal financial statement (PFS) that showed he had about $155 left over after\nexpenses each month. In May 2009, he received a raise that equates to another $200\nper month. His current income and expenses reflect a positive cash flow of about $330.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n4\n(Gx. 2; Ax. A; Tr. 46 - 47) He has contacted several debt management firms as well as\nthe regional Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS) where he lives. The former\nwere not effective and the latter recommended that he file for bankruptcy protection, but\nhe wants to try to repay or otherwise resolve his debts. (Tr. 29, 51 - 52)\nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation at work. His co-workers, supervisors,\nand the military customer he supports all praise his reliability, hard work, and integrity.\nLongstanding personal references also expressed similar support for Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and character. (Ax. B)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18, Guideline F (financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must prove\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. \n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nIf the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n6\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a - 1.n; that is, that Applicant accrued almost $40,000 in delinquent personal\ndebt that was unresolved as of March 2009. Applicant admitted all but one of the\nallegations, and has acknowledged that most of his debts remain unresolved. However,\nthe same information also shows that the actual amount of his debt, after duplicate\nallegations are removed, is about $29,756. Nonetheless, the record requires application\nof the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). As to AG \u00b6 19(a),\nthe information reflects only an inability, and not an unwillingness, to pay his debts.\nBy contrast, available information shows that Applicant and his ex-wife were both\nworking for the same company that laid them off in 2005 after they had divorced in\n2004. They were unable to pay off their marital debts, and Applicant eventually accrued\nadditional debt as his period of unemployment lasted for about nine months. Applicant\u2019s\nloss of employment also resulted in a loss of medical insurance. He incurred about\n$10,000 in medical costs, about $2,000 of which remains unresolved. When Applicant\nagain found work, it paid about 80% of his previous job. In August 2007, he was again\nlaid off and was unemployed for about 10 months before he was hired by his current\nemployer in May 2008. Since then, he has been successful in his work and has\n\n6\nimproved his monthly finances. After receiving a raise in May 2009, his net monthly\nremainder doubled. Although Applicant has not made much progress in repaying his\ndebts, he has acted (albeit with mixed results) to improve his current finances. When he\nwas hired in 2008, he was faced with the increased expenses of a long daily commute.\nHe incurred additional debt by allowing his vehicle to be repossessed, then buying a car\nthat is less expensive to operate and insure. Applicant has also consulted with CCCS\nand other debt management firms to resolve his debt. CCCS advised him to seek\nbankruptcy protection, but he feels it would be irresponsible to do so.\nBased on all of the foregoing, the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) and AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control) apply.\nThe ongoing presence of significant unpaid delinquent debt does not\nautomatically mean Applicant should be disqualified. The amount of debt at issue\ncertainly raises the possibility that Applicant could resort to illegal means to get money\nto pay his debts. But, however large or small the total debt, the analysis here must also\nconsider Applicant\u2019s response to his adverse financial circumstances and his overall\napproach to money management. Applicant established that he has been paying what\nhe can since his income returned, and that he has made difficult decisions to try to\ngenerate greater cash flow. Available information also shows that he has a positive\nmonthly cashflow that will enable him to continue making payments. On balance, I\nconclude that the security concerns about his unpaid debt are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 50 years old and\npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult. He has a solid reputation, at work and\namong his friends, as a person of solid character and reliability. Applicant was been\ncandid and forthcoming about his finances in his application for clearance, and in his\nresponse to DOHA interrogatories. There has been no financial or other misconduct on\nhis part, and his difficulties have been limited to two periods of unemployment and\nsubsequent recovery. Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing was likewise straightforward.\nHis candor, reputation, and the actions he has taken to date, support his claimed intent\nto satisfy his debts. His continued employment and his positive cashflow make it likely\nthat he will continue to resolve his debts and that he will not incur new unpayable debts.\nA fair and commonsense evaluation of this record shows that the security concerns\nraised by Applicant\u2019s credit history are mitigated, and his finances do not put him at risk\nof acting contrary to the national interest.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest for\nApplicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the original SOR, as well as the additional allegations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since January 2008. He does not hold an active clearance. He was employed in the private sector from April 2006 until he began his current employment. Applicant was first introduced to illegal drugs by his mother, who supplied him with marijuana when he was 16 years old. He smoked it at home once every three months. (GX 2 at 6). Applicant was arrested and charged with drug-related offenses in 1990, 1991, and 1993. The charges were dismissed on all three occasions because of illegal 3 searches (GX 2 at 5-6). In May 2008, Applicant told a security investigator that he did not possess drugs on any of these occasions, but he was in the area when drug users ran away and dropped their drugs on the ground near him (GX 2 at 6). Notwithstanding his assertion that he did not possess drugs on any of these occasions, he also told the investigator that the 1991 arrest occurred when the police searched him and found approximately two grams of crack cocaine (GX 2 at 5).

Security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement are mitigated, but security concerns raised by his falsification of his security \nclearance application are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 12, 2008. On April \n24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \nDecember 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 6, 2009; answered it on May 26, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nJune 1, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 24, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to an administrative judge on July 28, 2009. It was reassigned to me \non July 31, 2009, to consolidate the docket. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August \n6, 2009, scheduling the hearing for September 3, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1, 2, and 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. The record closed \nupon adjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 15, \n2009. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \nOn July 13, 2009, Department Counsel amended the SOR by amending SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 2.a and 2.b. Applicant testified he received the amendments in mid-July 2009, but \nhe misplaced the document and did not acknowledge receipt in writing (Tr. 17). He \nresponded to the amended allegations at the hearing (Tr. 18). He did not object to the \namendments (Tr. 19). \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a by deleting the \nallegation that he tested positive for cocaine in January 2004. I granted the motion to \namend, without objection from Applicant (Tr. 23-24). \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 3, a report of investigation. He did not \nauthenticate the report as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, and Applicant declined to \nwaive the authentication requirement (Tr. 32). GX 3 was not admitted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the original \nSOR, as well as the additional allegations. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since January 2008. He does not hold an active clearance. He was \nemployed in the private sector from April 2006 until he began his current employment.   \n \n \nApplicant was first introduced to illegal drugs by his mother, who supplied him \nwith marijuana when he was 16 years old. He smoked it at home once every three \nmonths. (GX 2 at 6). \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with drug-related offenses in 1990, 1991, \nand 1993. The charges were dismissed on all three occasions because of illegal \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsearches (GX 2 at 5-6). In May 2008, Applicant told a security investigator that he did \nnot possess drugs on any of these occasions, but he was in the area when drug users \nran away and dropped their drugs on the ground near him (GX 2 at 6). Notwithstanding \nhis assertion that he did not possess drugs on any of these occasions, he also told the \ninvestigator that the 1991 arrest occurred when the police searched him and found \napproximately two grams of crack cocaine (GX 2 at 5). \n \n \nApplicant sold cocaine during 1995 and 1996, and he earned about $1,500 a \nday, three days a week. In an interview with a security investigator, he denied using \ncocaine during this time, except for tasting it to make sure that it was cocaine (GX 2 at \n6). In 1996, he tested positive for cocaine during a urinalysis administered by an \nemployer as a condition of employment (GX 2 at 6). \n \nApplicant testified he enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1990. He was \nunable to report for active duty because of his arrest for possession of cocaine in 1991 \n(Tr. 47). He enlisted in the Regular Army in November 1997, and he received a security \nclearance shortly after his enlistment. He deployed twice to Iraq. In January 2005, he \ntested positive for cocaine during a random urinalysis just before his second \ndeployment. He learned while in Iraq that he had tested positive for cocaine. He \nreceived nonjudicial punishment for wrongful use of cocaine. In December 2005, he \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions (GX 2 at 7). \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied intentionally using cocaine in 2005. He testified \nhe believed that someone put cocaine in his drink without his knowledge while he and a \ngroup of soldiers were at a club. He testified that \u201cabout five\u201d other soldiers who were at \nthe club also tested positive for cocaine (Tr. 43). He considered contesting the charges \nby obtaining evidence from the club. He claimed his appointed lawyer was not able to \nhelp him and so he accepted the nonjudicial punishment and the discharge from the \nArmy (Tr. 40). \n \n \nApplicant has been married since August 1997 and has five children, two by his \npresent wife. He has one child from a previous relationship for whom he pays child \nsupport, and his wife has two children from a previous relationship (Tr. 51-52). \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she encouraged him to contest the cocaine charges \narising from the 2005 urinalysis, but he did not have the time or resources and he was \nafraid of going to jail (Tr. 57). She testified that Applicant was a sergeant at the time of \nthe urinalysis, was involved in the collection of the urine samples, and could have \nswitched his sample with someone else\u2019s if he had known he had ingested cocaine (Tr. \n58).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also testified that Applicant was raising his three-year-old \ndaughter by himself when she first met him. She encouraged him to \u201cget off the street\u201d \nand start being a father to his child. Since then, he has become a responsible father (Tr. \n58-60). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified his last drug involvement was in 1995 and 1996, when he was \nselling and tasting cocaine. He no longer associates with drug users (Tr. 50). \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application in April 2008, he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 23d, asking if he had ever been \u201ccharged with or convicted \nof\u201d any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.\u201d In his explanatory comments, he disclosed \nthat he tested positive for cocaine in a urinalysis in 2005, received nonjudicial \npunishment, and was discharged from the Army for drug use. However, he denied using \ncocaine in 2005, and he claimed that he was unable to contest the positive urinalysis \nbecause he was in Iraq (GX 1 at 30-31). He did not disclose that he had been arrested \nand charged with drug-related offenses in 1990, 1991, and 1993. \n \nIn an interview with a security investigator in May 2008, he told the investigator \nthat he did not disclose the drug-related charges because he was not required to do so \nwhen he enlisted in the Army, and he did not want to incriminate himself (GX 2 at 7). At \nthe hearing, he testified he thought he was not required to disclose the charges \nbecause the charges were dismissed (Tr. 41). He also testified he did not disclose the \ndrug-related charges when he enlisted because he was scared and did not know what \nwould happen if he disclosed them (Tr. 48-50). He submitted a copy of his local arrest \nrecord (AX A). It reflects misdemeanor convictions in 1990-1991 for drinking in public, \nthree failures to appear, an assault and battery, and carrying a concealed weapon. It \ndoes not list any drug-related charges.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant tested positive for cocaine during a urinalysis in \nJanuary 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a, as amended); tested positive for cocaine during a urinalysis \nin 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); was arrested for possession of drugs with intent to distribute in \nMarch 1993 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); was arrested for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute \nin March 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and sold illegal drugs in 1995 and 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, as \namended). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. Guideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1).  \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse (defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u2018the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction\u201d);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for illegal drug use;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; \nand  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(h): expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \n \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (b), (c), and (g). I find that AG \u00b6 \n25(h) is not raised, because Applicant has \u201cclearly and convincingly\u201d committed to \ndiscontinuing his drug involvement. He has been gainfully employed since May 2006, \nand he has focused on carrying out his family duties. There is no evidence of any drug \ninvolvement or other criminal conduct since his positive urinalysis in January 2005, \nalmost five years ago. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (b), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). I conclude that \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established, because Applicant\u2019s drug involvement is not recent and does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; [or] (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). I conclude that AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), (2), \nand (3) are established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s drug involvement alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.e. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that he falsified his security clearance application by not disclosing \nhis drug-related arrests in 1991 and 19931. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \narrest record is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . .\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a falsification allegation is \ncontroverted, as in this case, the government has the burden of proving it. An omission, \nstanding alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant was not a security neophyte when he submitted his April 2008 \napplication, because he held a clearance during most of his Army service. He disclosed \nthe January 2005 positive urinalysis, for which he believed he had a plausible \nexplanation, but he did not disclose his three drug-related arrests and charges. He gave \nmultiple explanations for omitting this information. He claimed he did not think he \nneeded to disclose it because the charges were dismissed, but he also admitted at the \nhearing that he did not disclose his drug-related arrests when he enlisted in the Army \nbecause he was afraid of the consequences of disclosure. He told a security \ninvestigator he did not disclose his arrests on his security clearance application because \n                                                          \n1 Question 23d on the security clearance application asks whether the person had ever been \u201ccharged \nwith or convicted of\u201d any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. It does not ask about arrests. All three of \nApplicant\u2019s arrests resulted in drug-related charges. Thus, he was required to disclose them. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhe did not want to incriminate himself. On consideration of all the circumstances \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions arising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct \nare: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information;  \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and  \nAG \u00b6 16(g): association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \nApplicant\u2019s history of drug possession, use, and trafficking raises all three of these \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established, because Applicant \ndid not disclose his drug-related arrests and charges until more than a year later, when \nhe was confronted with his criminal record. \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and his falsification of his security clearance application \nwere not \u201cminor\u201d offenses. His falsification was recent and did not occur under unique \ncircumstances. His personal conduct casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). This mitigating condition is established for his \ndrug-related conduct, because Applicant has finally made full disclosure of his drug \ninvolvement, thereby reducing his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nHowever, this mitigating condition does not apply to his falsification of his security \nclearance application. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cassociation \nwith persons involved in criminal activity has ceased . . . .\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). This mitigating \ncondition is established because Applicant no longer associates with drug users, \ndealers, or purchasers, but it does not apply to his falsification of his security clearance \napplication. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant grew up in a dysfunctional family and has a long history of drug-related \nincidents. With the help of a strong and supportive spouse, he appears to have left his \ndrug involvement behind him. On the other hand, his implausible and unconvincing \nexplanation for his positive urinalysis in January 2005 and his lack of candor on his \nsecurity clearance application raise doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement, but \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e (as amended):  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a (as amended):  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.
